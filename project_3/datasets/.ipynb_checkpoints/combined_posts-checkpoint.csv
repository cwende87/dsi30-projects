TravelHacks,"Hi everyone! Next month I'll be visiting my cousin in Germany, but I'll make a connection at the Heathrow Airport in London before I get there, and it will last for about 19 hours according to the airline.

This is my first time travelling all by myself, and I'm wondering what can I do in London while waiting for my next flight. I'm not actually sure if I'm allowed to leave the airport in this situation, but if I can, what is the best way to go to some cool places?

I've always wanted to see the Big Ben, the London Eye and places you need to see if it's your first time in London, but I have no idea how to get to these places from the airport or even if I'll have enough time to do so (I've been told the airport is incredibly huge and it'll take a while to find things inside it - it even has a train station inside it apparently?).

Also, when I come back to my country I'll make another connection in the same airport, this time lasting about 13 hours.

If anyone has tips or could even teach me how the subway/train/bus system works in London, I'd be super grateful. Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my native language!",What to do in London in 15+ hours?,1658264688

TravelHacks,"So I was looking into going somewhere this winter since I have 1 week left. 

However, domestic airline prices are ridiculous from where I am. Going to Denver, the cheapest, is $400 roundtrip per person. Other option would be to drive 4 hours to the nearest big city but even then, the prices are still ridiculously high. Getting out of Texas to somewhere worth it requires two days of driving. 

I wanted to visit Bozeman. It's $350 per person from San Antonio. Add in car rental and hotels and fuuu

Plus, most cities in North America are not really walkable, I would have to rent a car. And hotel prices are NOT funny. 

I was thinking of going to NL. I also have family there so no hefty hotel prices. I would commute by train which is not bad. And I could hop around different cities and try new food, xmas markets, visit fam, etc. Most surprisingly, the flights are $720 roundtrip from my hometown. Even cheaper than many domestic destinations. Again, ridiculous. 

But since I only have a week, I would only have 5 full days there to spend with fam and city hopping with them.

Well, now the day came when Agoda was to charge the money, and lo-and-behold, they charge +17% on top of the official exchange rate! I've never experienced anything like this. I thought it must be a mistake or related taxes or something but the confirmation stated it was including all taxes (even listed the amounts). I contacted their customer support and they just stated it was all due to Agoda's conversion fee which was stated when I booked. But nowhere was it stated Agoda would put a +17% surcharge on the official conversion fee. I tried to insist and say it must be a mistake but they were unyielding. They just advised me I could cancel the booking. Trouble is, rebooking with another site would be much more expensive - there's a reason I booked 6 months in advance!

TravelHacks,"Hello fellow travelers, I am soon going to be traveling to the USA. I live in Germany and I've never been outside of the EU which is why I am currently facing a dilemma regarding a fitting data plan for my phone/a portable wifi hotspot. I've been researching data plans and different kinds of portable wifi hotspots for a few hours now and I think I am more confused than before because there is so much contradictory information about it out there that I am turning to Reddit for some definite answers based on your guys' personal experience.

As I understand there are 3 options for me and my family now if we all want to have decent cellular internet. 


1. 1 big data plan so that one of us shares a mobile hotspot with the others
2. A data plan where everyone has their separate sim card that they use in their phones but all are connected to the same account thus also using the same data cap
3. A portable wifi hotspot that also uses a big data plan 

There are certain pros and cons to all of the options here but I feel like I don't have all the information nor the experience to argue which one is the best/most convenient/cheapest option. I can't be the first person ever to be facing this dilemma which is why I am hoping that one of you guys has some magical traveling life hack that works perfectly for me and my family.

I would love it if anyone has any sort of recommendation for me but what's most intriguing to me is option 3 because it was all the benefits from option 1 without the hassle of having your phone battery drained because of the mobile hotspot. Sadly I know too little to decide which one to get and if anyone can recommend a device that supports USA and Europe sim cards with decent battery size and internet bandwidth I would highly appreciate it.

Sorry if this whole post is incoherent but this is a last ditch effort to get this whole thing sorted out because I thought it would be way easier and it's now already only 1 week until the flight to Florida and I have yet to get something to work.

Unfortunately my wife had a medial emergency the week prior to our departure, and we were unable to make the journey.  Virgin was able to refund the tickets (with a note from the doctor), Enterprise refunded the car, and all of the hotels were able to refund the days that we had booked….well, almost.

I've been eyeing [https://www.sendmybag.com/](https://www.sendmybag.com/) as an option, but I'm a little skeptical because I had never heard of them until my Google deep dive.

My mom told me to wait until August to book flights in the autumn rather than book around this time because she claims prices are exceptionally high right now so that airlines can inflate the prices to take advantage of the peak in traffic and get more sales from tickets (even if the flights are booked for the autumn or even winter months), but will decrease once it gets to August/September and the summer travel traffic dies down.

So say that I want to book a flight for September from JFK to LHR. If I were to book one now, fares for economy are at least $900 USD for a direct flight.

Or will we arrive at the hostels and be told we can't stay here or need to book another bed?

If this is technically not allowed is it strictly enforced or are there ways around this? Realistically speaking even if we book two beds we will still most likely share a bed every night anyway.

We have found a small villa that will fit both of our families and a few close friends. For our wedding, we have always wanted a family vacation style, low key event where we can all stay in one place and enjoy the week together and get married one day while we’re there.

TravelHacks,"Actually I don’t care if it’s not simple.

I’m just trying to get true, cheap unlimited data, and repeat it using my router so that my camper can have a network with an internet connection.

What I’ve done so far is configured my Netgear DD-WRT router to repeat my wireless signal from my mobile hotspot on my phone. This gives me mind-numbingly fast internet (100+ MBps) good for every device in the camper, but is only good for about 5 gigs or so before it shuts off. I chewed through that in less than a day.

But, AT&amp;T is fine with me consuming 100s of GB per month *on my phone itself*, which I do. For some reason not allowed to do that in hotspot mode.

Standard “hotspot device” plans from T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&amp;T and so on are garbage and are up to $100 a month for only 15 gigs. This is unacceptable and a blatant scam. Why am I allowed to burn through *hundreds* of GB on my regular AT&amp;T plan with my phone, but the second I want to use that data for anything other than the phone, I’m told to get fucked?

There has got to be some way to just buy a cheap Android phone and root it and get an unlimited data plan, and somehow “spoof” the connection while the phone is actually bridged to a router. But I suppose if it worked that way, everyone would be doing it and these garbage hotspot device plans would not exist.

TravelHacks,"I've got a  trip coming up, and I had initially made a reservation for a ""Premium Elite SUV"" (BMW X3 or similar) at \~$100 per day. I got a 5% discount for being a member of Enterprise's loyalty program, and I figured that was good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, I decided to check if my USAA membership would get me a better discount. I saw that the ""Executive Luxury SUV"" (Range Rover Sport, Porsche Cayenne, Mercedes Benz GL450, or similar) option was \~$200 per day on the Enterprise app but \~$100 per day after logging in through USAA. I changed my reservation, thinking I was getting a 50% discount.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm not half-asleep and sitting at my desk actively avoiding work, I see that the difference between the vehicle classes on a standard web browser is only about one dollar. Premium Elite SUV is up to $111 now, and it was $100 when I started writing this post about 30 minutes ago. However, as I log in to the Enterprise website repeatedly, the prices keep changing even though I use the same pickup and drop-off location, date, and time. I don't necessarily have the time or desire to fire up my VPN and launch a private browsing session to see if the prices change, but I feel they might. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: is this common? The considerable price difference between the website and app. The price changes on the website with every new search even though none of the reservation details change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I keep checking back to see if the price drops significantly and re-book it if it does, or is $100 per day a good enough deal for the Executive Luxury SUV? Any tips or tricks you can share to get a better deal, or a better car, would be very much appreciated.

I called Hilton who said they’re side is right - despite me telling them they provide their rates to the agency. Soooo what’s going on? They said they’ll forward me to Booking.com and hung up lol.

TravelHacks,"**Time to go public! Here are the top perks of public transport and why you should be trying to use it more in the UK.**

Fuel costs have gone through the roof recently (£2 a litre, are you kidding me?)

As someone always looking to save and live as frugally as possible, I’ve started to use public transport much more.  
I know it isn’t viable for everyone because infrastructure is rubbish in some places. I visited a friend down by the coast, and the trains to London were once an hour.

But for those of us near or in cities, you can get about pretty effortlessly on the buses and trains.  
So here are the top 5 perks of using public transport. Drumroll, please…

1. It’s less stressful (mostly) - As long as you plan and leave in plenty of time, it’s nice to have someone else do all the hard work for you. Reading a book or watching a movie on your commute is far more relaxing than turning up to work covered in sweat, having sworn at every driver that hasn’t quite figured out where their indicator is yet.
2. You don’t have to worry about, or pay for, parking - I hate paying for parking on principle, especially when the rates vary so much from place to place. Public transport helps you avoid that headache so you can just arrive and go and do the things you want to do.
3. It makes the city a nicer place to be - I’m not the sentimental sort. I’ve lived in built-up areas most of my life, but fewer cars mean less noise and less toxic Victorian-like smogs drifting all over the place. That can’t be a bad thing.
4. It reduces your carbon footprint - Now, I care about the planet as much as the next guy. Public transport helps me save some cash, and it benefits the planet. I think that would be your classic win-win.
5. It’s cheaper than running a car - I know some people will argue this point but on average public transport is more affordable. That means more money in your skyrocket to do what you WANT to do instead of what you HAVE to do.

I spend a lot of my time commuting into London for gigs and events, so I’ve kind of got this down to a fine art now. Here’s how you can tie all that together to make the most of it in London.

Don’t pay for a single trip on the bus - ever. Use your contactless and get the whole day for £4.95.  
Use the Hopper fare for free unlimited bus travel within an hour after using your payment card for the first time.  
If you’re looking to stay the night in London like I do after a gig, start with booking . com and see what deals you can sniff out. There’s also this really cool browser extension called Slash that gives you an instant discount when you use it to book so you can save a bit more.

If you’re planning to do something interesting with your time or eat out at a decent restaurant, you can use that same Slash App for extra money off at Groupon and Red Letter Days for free.

Combine public transport with great deals, and you can still treat yourself and the family to some amazing days out. That App has been a bit of a revelation for me, and I use it as often as possible to save as much as possible.  
Hopefully, this will switch you onto public transport and help you save some cash in the process.

Cheers.",[UK] Top perks of public transport and why you should be trying to use it more. [OC],1656419485

Long story short. I booked a birthday getaway in August for my wife and I to stay at the Seadust Resort in Cancun as it was priced within our budget. I booked this as a package deal via Expedia with flights as well. 

Fast forward to today, I’m searching the web and come across a deal at another hotel which was the one I was originally hoping to book that didn’t initially fall within our budget at the time so I had skipped (Riu). I found a deal for the same price I’m paying at Seadust however I don’t know if it’s a good idea to cancel my stay at Seadust and book at the Riu. Seadust offers “Full Refund” up until August however I really don’t want to deal with having to fight to get my refund. Also, would I be able to keep my airfare and cancel the hotel?

TravelHacks,"I'm 22 years old and I am originally from Germany. I finished my high school degree in 2018 and right after school I started working for a company for some months to earn and save as much money as possible, that I could use to travel.

Well, some months later I was in a plane to Bali with 2 friends of mine. All of us just finished school and we were ready to spend 6 months in Bali and scale our online business there. Back then I just went with the flow, but today I know that this was one of the best decisions in my life.

We were lucky enough to meet some interesting people in Bali that taught and helped us with our business so that we had some international clients and we used that money to reinvest into new softwares, projects, etc.

After half a year we went back to Germany and I felt this old, stagnating lifestyle, and I knew if I would stay in Germany, I would not grow as a person, nor as a business. Most people in Germany are jealous, unhappy with their life and depressed. Just walk around a German city and try to smile to people, they will look at you as if you are a psycho. Everyone is rushing from place to place, form activity to activity, but most people don't enjoy the moment. And it's sad to see that.

This is nothing spiritual haha, I don't say I'm enlightened, and maybe everything I say is wrong, but today I can definitely say, that I'm as happy and free as never before. I moved to Cyprus about 3 years ago, and I met the love of my life. I started a YouTube channel ([where I also share my story](https://youtu.be/GpZOnKIY_8k)) and I grew my business to a point where I don't have to worry about money anymore. And that with just 22 years old (okay I turn 23 next week, haha.)

I don't make 6 figures a month like some other famous people claim, but I also don't have to. I make enough money to rent a house in Cyprus, buy my girlfriend presents and have a car and fun at weekends. I have amazing new friends here on that lovely island and I help people with my YT to do the same.

I hope that some other person feels inspired by my story of moving out and changing my life to the better, because everyone can do it and it is actually much easier (and cheaper!) than most people think.",Moving abroad changed my life ...,1656265341

So last week I went on a work trip to the USA (California) from the UK. Long story short, British Airways messed up my flights at both ends and delayed me by 17 hours going out and 5 hours coming back. 

From reading [https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/if-your-flights-delayed-or-cancelled/](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/if-your-flights-delayed-or-cancelled/) it seems in most circumstances I could be due £520 of compensation per flight. Some of my work plans where ballsed up, but my works given me free reign to claim this money for myself due to the stress incurred, I've put in a claim through BAs online portal, but just wondering if theres ways I can cut them off from potentially trying to wiggle out of any claims. 

For details on what happened. On my outbound flight from another UK airport to LHR, we landed on time, but did not have a gate available so sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half waiting on buses to take to the terminal, meaning I missed my connecting flight from LHR to the US. They put me up in a hotel &amp; promised meals, but the hotel didn't provide dinner as BA never instructed them too. 

On the way back I really have no idea what the cause for the delay was, my flight in the US boarded 30mins late, left the runway almost an hour late, then orbited LHR for ages coming in meaning we got to the gate, again, about an hour &amp; a half late, meaning I missed my connecting flight back home. 

It felt like BAs failings on both ends, are they able to wiggle out of me claiming a full £1040 in compensation?","UK &lt;&gt; USA Flight delays, how do I find out why my plane was delayed for compensation?",1656082419

Namely, the outsized value in redeeming first class flights. i.e. last year, my wife and I were fortunate enough to fly the new Singapore airlines first class suites (jfk-fra-sin) for 264,000 points RT each (528,000 points total). To put it into perspective, the flight would cost about ~$20,000 each pushing the redemption to  about 7.5 cents per point. That makes the redemption fantastic by all means. Also, the flight was an absolute dream. 

On the other hand, we are about to go to the Maldives and choose to fly economy (from NYC) because we did not have enough points to both fly business and stay at the hotel we wanted. We will be staying at the St Regis Maldives resort (overwater villa) for 10 nights and the cost was 620,000 Marriott points. The redemption rate was about 4 cents a point after fees. We have been to this resort before as well.

Let's just get to the point, we chose 10 days at the St Regis Maldives over another chance at the first class suites on Singapore airlines. Even at the cost of sitting in economy for 20+ hours (including layovers).

One thing I noticed immediately was that, hotels are already for two people, but flights you obviously have to pay per ticket. Given that first class flight will always have the best redemption rates, is it truly worth the amount of points to burn. 

So again, what's your take? Given you have two options..

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone!

I run several hotels around Europe, and as I get this question from friends a lot, I thought I share my insights for all of you to apply:

1. Do your research (obviously): Look at all meta-search engines &amp; OTAs. In my experience, currently, you find the best prices on the [booking.com](https://booking.com) mobile app, especially if you have a certain ""Genius"" status (which you get pretty fast)
2. Go direct: everyone knows hotels pay commissions, so help them save on the commission and save yourself some money by emailing them directly.
3. Look at smaller (boutique) hotels: the bigger brands have a centralized revenue management office, so most of the time, the person you are talking to doesn't have the power to give you a good deal. If you speak to smaller hotels, the person you are talking to probably sets the prices.
4. Be charming: It should be obvious, but people do it wrong every.single.time: be super friendly; this increases your chances of getting a better price significantly. Who would you rather give a deal? The smart-ass or the nice &amp; clever fella who just asks for an (understandable) better rate
5. Look at higher room categories: Don't choose the cheapest of the smallest. If you go for a higher room category, the hotel has much more flexibility to give you a better rate as they (mostly) have more availability in these categories, and it doesn't hurt their overall performance (revenue per available room) if they give you a deal. We are looking for the most VALUE for money, not the cheapy cheapest stuff.   


I hope this has helped some of you. Let me know if you have additional tips, as I also don't know it all:)

South of France obviously has great options with Provence right there and same could be said of Milan with Modena and Parma right down the road.

Which will have fewer language barriers? (We'll do what we can on DuoLingo in the next two months, but well aware that will only begin to scratch the surface. We both took 3+ years of French in high school, but I refer you again to our ages...that was three decades ago!)

I will be taking a trip to Europe later this summer, I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve so I have significant insurance benefits related to trip cancellation, medical emergencies, etc. However, I have read from other Redditors that Chase's trip interruption insurance won't really cover COVID related quarantine expenses, such as the hotel cost or any other costs - even when the trip needs to be extended.

I'm also reading that some coverages come with a COVID quarantine benefit, such as paying $250/day for COVID quarantine expenses, EVEN when they are the original days planned in your trip. I'm starting to research some of these options, but one element I'm struggling with is plans that include duplication of all of the benefits I have with the CSR card (trip cancellation, medical, accident, etc.). 

Does anybody know of a carrier that offers *just* the trip interruption insurance that would cover COVID quarantine, without the other elements? I don't love the idea of paying for duplication of coverage I already get, but recognize it might be the way it is with these policies.",COVID Quarantine Travel Insurance Only?,1654803491

TravelHacks,"OK,  yall. Help me solve a mystery. 

We stayed at an all-inclusive in Cancun. Throughout our trip, I could NOT get served by waiters unless my husband was present. If he was with us, waiters would come up to us, offer both of us drinks and then quickly produce them and keep coming back with more. Each time we were brought anything we tipped between $3 and $5 USD. 

If my husband was somewhere else, however, I could not get anyone to serve me. I could not get a bartender to respond at a bar, and I couldn't flag down a waiter without literally running in front of them and standing in their path, which I only resorted to at the end of our trip, since it seems pretty rude and I really don't like to be disrespectful to people in the service industry. I've been there, shitty customers are the worst. I tried to be very polite and thank everyone every time. Regardless of how I got their attention, I still tipped between $3 and $5 every time. Like I said, I've been there, and I realize they're all overworked and underpaid. This discrepancy persisted throughout our whole trip, and regardless of location or waiter. My husband witnessed it several times while standing apart from us, but within viewing range, so I don't think this is just me being over sensitive or anything.

I don't know of physical appearance played a part or not. For reference, we are both English-speaking Americans with a little Spanish, probably with terrible accents. We're both working to improve our Spanish. We're both a bit overweight with naturally blonde hair, though mine is currently dyed pink. 90% of the time, I had my 5yo son with me, who's super sweet and definitely wasn't rude to anyone, though they may not have known that he'd be well behaved before interaction. While at the pool, I was always wearing a normal tankini style bathing suit, with my husband in trunks, and my son in trunks and a rash guard. Sometimes I had a rash guard as well. If on a beach chair at the pool, I'd add a swim cover-up with covered shoulders (we all have Nordic skin and sun-burn in about 5 minutes). While out of the pool, I was generally in a maxi-dress while my husband and son would typically be in a Hawaiian shirt and shorts. All of us would have been wearing nice sandals. This fit in well with what others were wearing, so I think we were always dressed appropriately. 100% of the time, I was wearing sunglasses. Most people weren't, as it was overcast for the entirety of our trip, but I have Parkinson's induced light sensitivity, so I'm always wearing sunnies. Other than the light sensitivity, my symptoms aren't visible and I wasn't shaking, so I don't think that could be a factor.

Any idea why I couldn't get service? Any tips for being able to get service on future trips?

Was told Pre-Paid Rental Car unavailable 1 day before 2-week road trip. Advice?

Booked and Pre-Purchased a non-refundable rental (cargo van) from Hertz directly in mid April for use of period of 2.5 weeks starting today. The afternoon 1 day before we are to pick up the vehicle get a call from local branch saying they won't have the vehicle and that it was a mistake that it was allowed to be booked (I've rented cargo vans from them in the past).

All they would/could do is say sorry for the inconvenience, and try to pass me on the the corporate 1-800#.. I called that and after several hours still without any solution. They did mention I could get a large SUV from their ""sister"" company (Dollar) for an upgrade fee of $4800!

As of right now now it is 18 hours from when we were to pick up the vehicle and no solution yet.. Any advice? I tried checking other rental companies and their prices are sky-high and no one else does cargo van. A larger SUV could work but not at that cost.

I am from India. I am a student and from a poor family.  I am very much into video games, specially Dota 2. This year the biggest esports event is going to be held for the first time in Singapore.

We will work our ass off for the next 5 months. I feel like we can manage around a $950. The event ticket price itself for two is going to be around I assume $200.

I come and go from my home in the US regularly. I can be gone for 1-4 months, then back for 1-4 months.

I want to figure out an elegant solution with the following parameters

* I can use my unlocked iPhone 13.
   * note: this has a dual sim option... could this help with this hack?
* I can keep and use my US phone number (the one all of my US-based connections use), and it works for (at least) receiving texts from US-based connections while traveling (and, ideally, also seeing who is try to make calls to me/receiving voicemails), plus talk/text and decent-good data coverage/speeds while I'm home in the US.
* I want just-good-enough data speed internationally to use Google maps, send emails, open a websites... I don't need anything high bandwidth.
* I want to be able to use wifi calling to make calls using my US-based phone number to US-based connections.
* I'd like the mechanics to be painless as possible: I don't have to swap around simcards or contact service providers every time I come and go from another country.
* The solution is a reasonable cost (no more than, say $60-70/month... preferably less).

Here are some things I've explored and why they won't work for me:

* T-Mobile plan: They aren't OK with me being away for 4 months, and 128 kbps intl data speed is perhaps not even enough for my limited requirements.
* Google Fi: They aren't OK with me being away for 4 months, and they don't have wifi calling on iphones.

Here are some ingredients I've looked into that might combine to make this work:

* International Data Sims
* TextNow app
* Text/call forwarding services

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone!

Writing to you from Nafplio, Greece, 3 weeks into what is going to be a 4 month backpacking trip through the Balkans and some of Central/Eastern Europe.

I wanted to share some of my general thoughts with you guys, where I got burned on money so far, what ended up cheaper than I expected, and other various things.

To start off,

Utilize Google maps. I feel this is an obvious one to many, but the amount of people I have come across who don't know how to use the website/app to its full potential is shocking.

Searching for places to sleep is, in my humble opinion the easiest to do while zooming in on the location of interest in Google maps, and clicking the ""hotels"" button, which then shows you every hotel in the vicinity and the price. You can even put in the dates you want to find availabilities. I'd avoid websites like booking.com and trivago or whatever else exists. I always find the phone number of a place of interest, and directly call them to confirm prices and availabilities. 

Secondly, utilize supermarkets. This is a big one for me. If you are looking to longterm travel (anything over a month), and want to save some money, make your own sandwiches! Don't sit down at a tavern, restaurant, or whatever every meal, instead go to a supermarket. They often have cooked meals/sandwiches/burgers inside which are usually much much cheaper than sitting down at an establishment. I'm not saying don't sit down at all, but don't do it for every meal! The fun of it wears off if it's all you do...

While we are on this topic, location matters! That supermarket is going to have higher prices if it's in the middle of downtown! The same goes for cornershops, rooms, basically anything. When I am booking a room to stay in, the first thing I look for is proximity to a bus station, and that it's not in the middle of tourist central. I'd also really recommend taking that extra 5-10min walk out of downtown to shop for food, or even sit down to eat. The prices change astronomically! Also, you're better off (in terms of enjoyment, and finances-usually) to book a room in 1 location which is in an area that is close to public transport for a couple days, rather than hop from location to location sleeping in a different place every night. It usually ends up being cheaper, and you don't have to pack up everything and move all the time. It feels more like a vacation this way.

To not keep this too long, I'll add one more tip.

Find someone to travel with. Whether it's someone you meet on the road, or a friend from your hometown, anyone you can get along with. Keep it to a pair in my opinion as rarely will you fully enjoy yourself in a big group of let's say 6 (everyone usually wants to do something different).  I've saved about a thousand dollars so far just by travelling with my girlfriend instead of alone. Oftentimes a room in a motel is cheaper than 2 beds in a hostel. That sandwich looks really big that you just ordered? You can split it. 2 budgets, one mind goes a long way. Not to mention that you're safer this way, and should you want to hitchhike (don't be afraid to do this with 2 people!), people are more likely to pick you up when there's 2 of you rather than alone.

I could write all day, but this is already a book.

If you like me, and want to see what I'm all about and how I'm making 4 months of travel possible on a really low budget, check out my humble channel, I've just started creating travel videos, and I'm fairly consistent:)

All love,

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,

Last year, my girlfriend and I booked a trip outside of Canada around Christmas. Unfortunately, due to the rising COVID cases around that time, my girlfriend did not feel comfortable going. We were able to cancel her ticket and Air Canada issued a credit for the amount (700ish).

We are now planning a trip this summer and want to use the travel credit. I spoke with a representative from Air Canada recently and they informed me the credit is only valid for my girlfriend. This means only she can use it and we would have to book separately. I don't mind paying for my ticket in full but obviously we would like to book together to take advantage of it. 
 
I am able to get a travel voucher; however, it will take about 10 weeks to arrive. Had I known about this when we cancelled, I would've requested the travel voucher at the time. With the voucher, we would be able to both utilize the credit, instead of booking separately.

First of all : she won't be able to send regular text message abroad without roaming so that's not an option. She won't be receiving the text messages if she turns off roaming, which is good to avoid notification but not good to set up some kind of auto-reply system.

Is there a web service she could use or forward her text message to in order to reply using her phone number through internet?

Can we setup that kind of auto reply directly with the carrier within the country of origin (which would mean not roaming) ?

- It cannot use roaming
- she doesn't know which client will reach her but needs to be able to send an auto-reply using her number

They told us to check back in the morning to see if cars were available then. I was in town for a wedding and had to drive through the night, so I was unable to wait until the morning, so I had to look to other options.

It was late at night, so the only other Car rental company that was open and had cars was Budget. The cheapest car they had available was $590, so I had to rent from them.

I called Thrifty the day after and requested they refund my down-payment and also compensate me for the nearly $400 financial loss that I incurred due to the price of the cheapest available car at the airport available for a last-minute booking.

I understand that mistakes happen and companies are entitled to make mistakes, but companies should also rectify the situation with their customers when a mistake is made. In this case, Thrifty made a mistake by not correctly allocating the number of cars to fulfill my reservation, and it directly caused me to suffer a $400 financial loss,

And then use my Thai passport info when I buy the ticket and show it when I'm checking in and boarding.

I guess what I'm a little confused by is the exact definition of ""entering"" and ""exiting"". Does this simply mean whenever I go through immigration or customs? So for example, I show my US passport when I go through immigration on my departure from the US (exiting) and show my Thai passport when I go through customs on my arrival in Thailand (entering)? And then same thing when I leave?

Also, I have a connecting flight in Japan. I haven't travelled internationally in a while (because of obvious reason), but with connecting flights they only check your boarding pass right? Which means I just have to show my Thai passport (aka, the passport I used to buy the ticket)?

I need your help! I'm planning a trip with a friend to Marseille but know nothing about the city or its activities. Now I'd love to get some suggestions of what to do in the city.

TravelHacks,"Will add some details. The hotel is in NYC (soho). I have stayed here on another occasion. Reserves through third party (sorry).

Price point it’s not on the expensive/luxurious side but not a “cheap hostel”. Price point is 350-400 for the double bed room I’m staying at. 

(During this second stay I already had to request a change because the room they gave me was awful compared to the one I stayed at my last stay on the same. Way  smaller with no place to put my clothes and the bathroom was worse in every single way. Politely asked for a better room and by chance they gave me the one I stayed at last time.)

This time around on my 4th night out of 8 this happened.  (Videos are not in order)

[https://imgur.com/a/ZEoBP27](https://imgur.com/a/ZEoBP27)

Terrible noise at 3 am(the video with the lights on). It woke me up, had to go to the front desk to address the issue. 

They told me the heater was acting up, I should close the water / heating valves. I complied. The noise changed into the second version of the noise (the one in the dark clips).

Went to the front desk again, they told me the issue would fix itself and it did not, it sporadically starts this weird noise.

My sleep is already fucked and I’m very non functional in low sleep.

Am I being entitled for asking for compensation? What should I expect when I go to discuss the issue at the front desk again. I currently have no energy and in a terrible mood to engage in a conversation with the poor guy that is at the desk at 4:50 am.  (This issue started ar 3 am).

In the past I used TransferWise once to transfer money to someone abroad. However, I never thought of using it more than that.

Now I will travel back again and I'm trying to find ways to save money (cashback, no fees, promo code which never seems to work, etc.).

I'm thinking that travelling with a Wise card would be a great way to save money, but I'm not sure to understand how it works.

1. Do you need to add your own money into the Wise account (transfer from local Bank to Wise account)? If yes, is there any fees doing that?
2. What's the best way to travel? Transfer money in Wise account, pay stuffs with lower fees than your country credit card and after your trip transfer back all the money left in your bank account?
3. They seems to have a Virtual Card now. What's about?

Normally, I pay abroad with credit cash (fees) or withdraw cash (other fees). If I pay with Wise, do I still get fees (lower) or no fees at all since maybe it show as a local credit/debit card?

TravelHacks,"Hi fellow travelers !

A friend of mine and myself are planning a 6 months trip to southeast Asia starting in September. We're living in France but are basically looking for the cheapest options to Asia so we'd also be ready to move around if the tickets are cheaper from another country.

Our plan is to spend 1 or 2 months in Nepal and then to travel closer to southeast Asia (Indonesia, Borneo, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia), or the other way around.

We searched Skyscanner for flights from Paris/Milan/Lyon/Geneva to Kathmandu and New Delhi, but we did not find too many options, and the few we did were one way tickets for around 300€. Is it possible to find anything cheaper, maybe by getting a two ways tickets straight off ?
We are not opposed to travelling for longer in order to get there, but the fewer the layovers the better.

Do you have any good companies to recommend for this itinerary, good flight connections that would get us there or good hidden gems websites that we could use ?

TravelHacks,"I feel I should warn people wanting to travel on a shoestring about wizzair.

First of all, I have no use for people who buy tickets with low cost airlines and then complain that the comfort isn’t equivalent to that on more expensive airlines.  The _only_ thing I expect from a low cost carrier is that it gets from me from A to B in one piece. I don’t care if the aircraft seats are wooden. I don’t care if I have to walk a kilometer on the tarmac to the airplane.  But I do care that I get from A to B. 

Unfortunately, Wizzair does not even care enough to get you from A to B even when you have paid them money and they have promised to transport you.

I made two bookings on wizzair, one for a flight in the evening, the second for an onward flight from the arrival airport the next morning. I was counting on going from A to B with wizzair via C. 

A few weeks later I got an email telling me that the second flight had been cancelled and that I could take a flight from C to B on the day before I had planned to travel.

3 long phone calls to Wizzair’s customer service later (€1.99/ minute) and:

- despite suggesting that I move my flight from C to B forward by one day, they will not move my flight from A to be B forward by one day, despite them seeing both bookings _and knowing that it is their fault_ ,

- despite canceling my flight from C to B, they _will not let me fly with wizzair from A to B via another airport on the day they had promised_ and for which they had taken my money,

- despite causing me to lose money by cancelling my flight and refusing to let me rebook, they will not think of refunding my flight from A to C,

- they won’t even let me fly on the day I was scheduled to fly from C to B from different airports to B on direct flights _even though the terms of the contract obliges them to let passengers rebook_ .

Obviously they have good lawyers and I’m sure that under the Hungarian laws that apply it is legal, but I still do think that even a budget airline should rebook passengers when a cancellation on their part has disrupted flight plans.

So, everyone considering consecutive bookings with wizzair should bear in mind that wizzair __won’t even try to help them get from A to B when it cancels flights__  . I had not expected this, because other wizzair employees _really_ do try to do right by the passengers.

I have to wonder if such policies don’t cost them more in lost sales and lost profits than they save by being such complete shylocks.",A warning about Wizzair and consecutive bookings.,1650898781

TravelHacks," Hey all, I just recently purchased a flight from smartfares and they've been really putting me through the wringer trying to fix this whole issue. So I bought a round trip flight for Japan Airlines from Chicago to Manila from them because they had the lowest fare and I needed to save some money, but the returning flight included a connecting flight that requires an airport transfer from the Haneda to Narita. However, when I called Japan Airlines to confirm this booking because I always want to stay ahead of stuff especially when it comes to international traveling, they told me that it is not possible for foreigners to make an airport transfer due to ongoing covid restrictions.

I should have put two and two together in my head when I initially saw that there was an airport transfer, but I initially assumed since it was displayed as an available flight on the smartfares website, there shouldn't be any issue with it. The guy I talked with didn't seem to have my best interest in mind either and when I asked for a full refund he said it was out of the question because it's non-refundable and I would have to pay an absurd minimum of 400-500 fee even though I feel like it's kind of their fault as a service for advertising a flight that none of their customers can really even take. I also looked further into the company, which I regrettably should have done in the very beginning and it turns out they're an indian based company despite them being ""headquartered"" in san diego. Definitely seems a little shady, but I found them through google flights.

TravelHacks,"I would like to start by telling you that it is not an advertisement, I am not trying to promote anything, I just want to reveal some of the ""tricks"" that I apply for each DIY holiday

 I often follow the DYI vacation offers proposed by different travel blogs in order to have a start point. If something catches my eye (from the seen ideas) or if I have a specific destination in mind, then it's a match and the ""holiday hunt"" begins.

 The organization of the vacation is divided by me into 3 main categories:

 1. Airline tickets
 2. Accommodation
 3. Tourist objectives


 The most important aspect before starting the ""hunt"" for tickets is anonymity: deleting all cookies and using the incognito mode.  Most of the time, I use a search engine that will show me all the possible options from all the airlines, for example google flights. After discovering the optimal option, I go directly to the airline's website (usually a small fee is also applied through the third party) and choose the plane tickets.  There have been a lot of offers lately, so why not take advantage?  Some examples of purchased tickets: Bucharest (Romania) - Naples (Italy): 2 euros, Bucharest (Romania) - Florence (Italy): 12 euros, Bucharest (Romania) - Athens (Greece): 11 euros. I often check the costs of a plane ticket near my city, namely Craiova (it is a much smaller airport and from time to time they have better prices).  For example, for Bucharest (Romania) - Paris (France) was 500 euros, but for Craiova (Romania) - Paris (France) I paid 40 euros. 


For accommodation I prefer the option through Booking or Airbnb, being cheaper than the hotel.  After finding something profitable, I check all the reviews of the property (be sure to find reviews, so you are not the first person to rent).  It is preferable to rent somewhere close to the tourist objectives you want to visit, so as not to waste time and not to spend a lot of money on transportation. I've never had a problem with renting from Airbnb / Booking.  I’ve rented a single room in an apartment / house, where I practically lived with strangers, but everything was ok.  Examples of found prices (p.s the prices are per night, for each person): Budapest (8 euros), Athens (6 euros), Naples (24 euros).


 Regarding the list of objectives, I often try to look for the recommendations of the locals, because they are the most interesting.  Some important info: there are many tourist attractions where tickets are either free or discounted for students / EU citizens or free on the first Sunday of the month for everyone (to be checked on the site or at the box office). Online purchased tickets are often cheaper and include the ""skip the line"" option, which is perfect.  There is also the card option for tourist (for an extra amount of money, you’ll have access to certain tourist objectives + transport through the city, with a given validity: 2, 3, 4 days).  Sometimes the difference is justified, sometimes not.

TravelHacks," **High crime rate**

Travellers are recommended to be aware of pickpockets and thieves at popular tourists spots, restaurants, and public transport. Pickpocketing, mugging and petty other thefts are recurring concerns on the streets of Istanbul and other regions including the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Bazaar and Taksim Square. Travellers are urged to hold their bags tightly by their sides and stay alert to their surroundings. 

**Turkish gangs** 

Besides pickpocketing, violent crimes are also prominent in the country due to the presence of Turkish gangs. Terrorism has emerged to be a major worry for tourists in recent years due to active attacks on prominent regions in the country. 

**Reckless public transport operators**

Local drivers in the country are known to drive recklessly, ignoring important traffic rules and signs. Therefore, it is important for tourists to be cautious while travelling in public transportation to ensure safe travel in the country. Furthermore, taxi drivers often trick customers into paying more or by giving wrongful information about the costs and tourists places. 

**Lack of proper health support**

Amid increasing COVID-19 cases in the country, Turkish healthcare infrastructural was deficient and failed to follow regulations. The hassled nature of Turkey’s healthcare system has been unable to provide the necessary healthcare support to infected tourists. Therefore, tourists are advised to avoid travelling to Turkey, particularly in case of possible symptoms of infections, due to the lack of systematic healthcare support.","Important things to know when traveling to Turkey (Amid Safety, concerns Traveling in Turkey )",1650544349

TravelHacks,"Use the Seven Stages of Empire model. I'm in the USA, the controlling state in a collapsed empire. It's the wrong time for me to be here. I was born in 1985 during its decadence phase, I left in 2007 to the Philippines with my abusive parents, my father returned to the USA, and later my mother and I returned to the USA. When we returned, it was then that the President of the Philippines vowed to ""destroy"" oligarchs and Pumyra vowed to kill Lion-O next time they met. The similarities between both vows were not lost on me, and seeing this similarity between a children's cartoon and reality, it was then that I decided to leave for the USA. Things haven't gone to hell properly until other than the simple fact that it's real and serious, it's indistinguishable from a satire of itself, and turning the serious realities of the Philippines into a children's cartoon would be a kind of satire. So things had become a satire of itself.

Then what needed to happen starting when I was five years old happened: the police ran me out of there and I went homeless. All told through two different stages in this ----ing empire, I've been through a long series of institutions that don't adequately function, including its schools, a terrible home, terrible homeless shelters and even a terrible park. I'm autistic, I got into fistfights against housemates and jocks when I was in school, I have a long history of becoming radicalized online, and the empire discriminates against autistics. I have settled and deliberate aggressive anger at this ----ing empire. In school the first time I became radicalized online, I was taking a class in Western Hypocrisy for general education. I turned about 28 years old, and the political views I've taken up are an ultrableak Juvenalian satire of itself instead. The empire likes to claim it's an innocence guilt culture, but it's actually an honor shame culture based on high stakes dishonesty and manipulation. It's forcible and had a lot of clout, but now ---- that, I ride my scooter really fast, I California stop at intersections, and I take it as it's ""personal and possibly unlimited in scope"" (wording is from Wikipedia's article on anger). The empire has free speech and below average institutions, and is intermediate in every other way because it likes to: its equipment is intermediate in size and sophistication, it's inverted totalitarian which is intermediate between classical totalitarianism such as the PRC and being a normal country like Sweden, and it's biased in favor of neurotypicality, which is intermediate between autism and psychopathy. Even its intermediate rifle cartridge is intermediate between Russia's 5.45 x 39 and the PRC's 5.8 caliber intermediate rifle cartridge; its intermediate rifle cartridge is an intermediate intermediate rifle cartridge.

_---. This. Intermediate. _---. I have needed to leave ever since I can remember. But where to? Back when I was an Anarcho communist in college, I needed to be in Greece. But now I'm not, and I still need to leave. When I was still living in the terrible home, I was planning to move to the UK. But now I'm learning Swedish, and I've completed something about Python and Go on Sololearn, an app for learning computer programming. Sweden is part of Scandinavia, the best in the world in computer programming. r/askautism suggested Acre, Brazil. I don't know anything about Acre nor about Brazil.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone! My wife and I just recently returned from an amazing 11 day trip to France. I wanted to share the different ways we used credit card points to pay for the trip. 

Flights:
We each have a Delta Amex Gold card we got a sign up bonus of 60,000 points for. We originally had this trip planned for April 2020 but covid derailed that. At that time we had gotten RT tickets for 30k miles each. This time we couldn't get a good deal so we ended up spending 58,000 miles and then an additional $90 for a Premium Select seat upgrade. 


We'd been accumulating points with our Chase Sapphire Preferred card during the pandemic including a couple of referrals with family and friends. We then decided to upgrade to the Sapphire Reserve and got a 50,000 point bonus as well as 1.5x value for the points. With these points we were able to book a few things. 

Rental Car:
We used the Chase Portal to rent the car through Avis. European gas prices are ridiculous so we opted for the small, hybrid hatchback they had. We ended up spending 20,700 points on the vehicle and we got a free upgrade once we got there. 

Hotels:
The Sapphire Reserve card comes with an annual $300 travel credit which applied to the Airbnb we got in Paris for 7 days and paid the rest of the $1,300. We also stayed in the Eastern part of France in a few hotels. We stayed at a beautiful castle-hotel with its own moat! It was a 4-star hotel in the Champagne region and we paid 12,750 points for one night. We also stayed at a 5-star hotel in Colmar for 2 nights for 37,500 points. It had a 2-star Michelin restaurant in the hotel as well as a spa with a pool, sauna, ice room, hammam and some very comfortable heated chairs. And one more night we stayed in Nancy at a historic hotel for 11,050 points. We definitely could've used our points wiser but they're experiences we wouldn't pay for if we had to use cash. 

Transportation:
Paris has an extensive Metro system as well as a city-sponsored rental bike program as well as Lime/Uber bikes and electric scooters. For these we used the Capital One Venture One card. We had the Venture card for years but we ended up downgrading it so we could use the Reserve card as our daily. But, we had about 14,000 points stored up worth $140 in travel related reimbursements which includes these types of transportation. We ended up spending about $100 between Train tickets and rental bikes and scooters which we redeemed points for and essentially got them for free. 

Having all these things paid for meant that the only thing we had to pay out of pocket for is shopping and eating. With the Sapphire Reserve card you get 3x points on restaurants so we got a good amount of points during the trip between all the pastries and ice cream we ate. 

We definitely could've been more frugal with our points looking back (cheaper hotels, flights and rental car.) But it was a trip we had been waiting for for such a long time so we splurged on some things that we normally wouldn't. But hopefully this have some people ideas on how to use their points for traveling.

TravelHacks,"Budgeting a Europe Trip (1 month)

Hi everyone, I am a young female traveller planning to visit Portugal, Italy (only for a few days) and Croatia for around a month between May and June. I have booked a majority of my accommodations and travelling (flights, busses, etc) which i assume will be the most hefty expenses of my trip. I have never travelled alone before, let alone in another continent and I just have a general question for those with experience! 

I am bringing around 3-4K (CAD) on the trip and I think that this will be enough to cover the rest of my expenses (groceries, eating out). Since I am on a budget, I don’t plan to spend money frivolously on tourist attractions, eating at expensive restaurants, or doing a lot of shopping. Rather, I plan to just relax, explore by walking around different parks and cities, hiking, taking pictures on my camera, journaling, and doing the things I can do that are for free :) 

Is it naive of me to assume that this amount will be enough to cover general costs? I don’t think groceries will be that crazy expensive and again i reiterate, I do not plan to spend much money on tours, day trips, expensive wine, shopping  or those kinds of things in general. I have also read that portugal and croatia are a few of the cheaper countries to visit in europe.

I live in Hawai’i but I go to college in Minnesota. 

As of right now, I am tracking the price for the flight. I’m thinking of buying the tickets around the end of May, and I think I will buy 2 separate tickets because it seems to be cheaper than the multi - city ticket somehow. A lot of the flight have an incredibly short connection time so my choice is quite limited, but I think I have pick out several that will give me a decent chance to transfer, that cost around $1600. 

The thing I’m most anxious about is the tickets because of the transfer time and how limited my options are. Other than that, I am also quite nervous about the customs but I will apply for an eVisa beforehand and do what I gotta do. 

I would really love if you can provide me some advice. The thing I’m really in need of is an estimate layover time. I will generally always have 2 layovers, one within the U.S. and another in a foreign country. I try to leave about 1h30m for domestic and about 3 hours for international, would that be enough to account for delay and custom?

2) Should we rent a car? I'm leaning towards yes but I guess this all depends on where we want to go. We are probably not going to go to Cinque Terre as it seems difficult to do with an 18 month old toddler.

3) Should we do two day trips and two days in Florence or one day trip and 3 days in Florence? There are so many possibilities for day trips e.g. Siena, San Gimignano, Val D'orcia. Is it worth doing a long day trip to like Lake Como?

TravelHacks,"Hi, guys! 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally got the promotion I'd been waiting for three years. Starting next month, I'll have a lot of business trips, and my bag should be ready at any time. It should look presentable and be roomy enough for me to carry a change of clothes, essentials, and my laptop. 

I thought about the bag's material and decided that leather was the best option for my purposes simply because it's more durable and easier to clean. I found a leather weekend bag that seems to be exactly what I need, but it's rather pricy, so I'm looking for something similar but less expensive. It doesn't have to be a famous brand, even a no-name, but of decent quality will do.

My wife also thinks that I need a holdall because it's a perfect transformer bag for business trips, which allows keeping clothes and shoes in good shape. When placed vertically, suits, trousers, and shirts don't crumple and always look flawless. For me, a huge pro is that it has a section for a laptop and a separate one for shoes. 

As for the color, I think I'll go with a black one - it's universal, and there are plenty of products for maintaining black leather. Brown ones are undoubtedly beautiful, but I think it's harder to pick the exact match when choosing a shoe cream for polishing. 

All in all, I'm looking for advice from the people who used similar bags. Are they truly as convenient as they look? What do you usually take with you on your business trips - I mean things that fit in your bag and are absolutely a must? 

And, as I mentioned earlier - if you could give me some tips on where I can find a less expensive version of the bag I mentioned - I'd be very grateful. I've tried Amazon, but the ones I found seem to be poor-quality knock-offs, so I don't want to invest in that. 

If all durable leather bags of this type are expensive, I'll probably go with the one I found. But I thought of asking you guys first because you may know of more affordable options that I won't find on my own.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone! Posted this on /r/travel and hoping to get some insights from this subreddit as well

Heading to Italy for 2 weeks around late September. We've planned the itinerary as per below, would this overall trip work? Any suggestions on tips, things to do or not to miss out on would be greatly appreciated as well!

I'm a first-time visitor to Italy but my partner isn't and has already covered most of the major sights in Rome/Florence/Venice.

* Day 1: Touchdown in Milan, Malpensa Express to Milan (full day)
* Day 2: Milan to Rome in the morning
* Day 3: Rome (full day)
* Day 4: Rome (full day)
* Day 5: Rome to Salerno (to visit the Amalfi coast, staying 1 night)
* Day 6: Day trip - Salerno to Amalfi/Pompeii (full day)
* Day 7: Salerno to Bologna
* Day 8: Food factory tour in Bologna (full day)
* Day 9: Bologna to Florence
* Day 10: Florence (full day)
* Day 11: Florence (full day)
* Day 12: Florence to Venice
* Day 13: Venice (full day)
* Day 14: Venice to Milan
* Day 15: Milan to Airport and back home


For transport, we'll be taking high speed Frecciarossa or Italo trains across cities. I'm not too sure on the transport to Salerno and Amalfi. It seems we can take a Frecciarossa from Rome to Salerno and then there's either a ferry or a bus that can take us to Amalfi. We'll also be carrying luggages across cities, any tips on safety is also much appreciated.

1. How difficult is it to get from Amman to West Bank? I don’t speak Arabic, and won’t have cell service right away to be able to call any services  

2. How much roughly should I expect to spend getting from Amman to West Bank? I know there’s buses but also visa fees and probably other fees,(something about a bridge?)

I know US requires one to enter the country but not sure about leaving it.  

4. Additionally from previous question, even though Jordan does not require pcr to enter Amman, will I still need a pcr to get from Amman to Ramallah since I believe I need to cross through Israel?

TravelHacks,"Who dares to disagree hasn't traveled light, and I strongly recommend trying it. You'll see how your attitude to the upcoming trip changes because we all know that the most hated thing is gathering stuff and tamping it in a big suitcase. Many people just don't know how to travel light, and I'd like to share some pieces of advice from my personal experience and dozens of successful vacations. I'll tell you what I take whenever I plan to get out of the country, and you'll have an idea where to start.

The first tip will be to purchase a small backpack or a leather weekend bag as I did, and then just travel with what will fit into it. It's about how to get started. But you'll probably need some guidance on what to put in your bag and how to travel with so few things. Here're my tips:

1) I travel with a light laptop, a few clothes, my phone, headphones and a few chargers, toiletries, and almost nothing else. Light windbreaker in case of wind and light rain. Eye mask, earplugs, and passport. That's all — no extra shoes, books, or suits. Don't take a road cushion. It isn't a necessity. Don't take an additional camera other than my phone.

2) I take the clothes that I can wash in the sink or the shower, which will dry overnight. Just light things that I can lay in layers. Often these are sports-style clothes.

4) For cold places, I have thermal underwear, a pair of long-sleeved T-shirts, and a hat. I usually don't go to places where it's snowing (I don't know why probably because I don't like the color white), so I don't have clothes for this weather.

5) For warm places, I take flip-flops and swimming trunks and leave most warm clothes at home.

TravelHacks,"It's always so exciting to get on a plane or go somewhere you've never been. Even a few days can be good medicine for the body and an ideal recovery for the nerves. I adore traveling and try to get out of the country each vacation. Thus, I've gathered some lifehacks that will be useful for every tourist.

Each journey starts with packing your luggage. It's the most important stage of your holiday preparation. If you don't want to end up with a ruined vacation, take care of a high-quality suitcase. I've purchased Monos Luggage, and after four trips, it hasn't got broken so far. I'd also advise marking your luggage as fragile even if you take only clothes with you. Baggage handlers at the airport are infamous for the rough handling of road cargo. The probability that airport workers will throw your bag carelessly is much less if it's marked as fragile, and your items and the suitcase itself will be protected from unexpected deterioration.

If you travel a lot during your vacations and stay at each place for just a few days, don't unpack everything. Just take what you need. It will save you time to get ready quickly at the last minute.

Another useful travel hack is to keep a $50 bill under the insole. In case you lose your purse or get stolen, you will still have enough money to return the taxi to the hotel and get help. It's a great way to ensure your cash reserve is protected no matter where you are. 

Last but not least advice is to use Google Maps offline. Just open the app on your phone when you are connected to the network, find the place you are interested in, then tap on the 3 small dots on your screen and select """"Download Offline Map"""". This little travel life hack is very useful. Thus, you save battery power and can reach the desired destination even with no Internet connection.

TravelHacks,"April of 2021, my girlfriend, her parents, and myself booked travel to Tokyo for March 2022. Prices were low and we jumped at the chance of flying to one of our favorite places for roughly 50% off. Plus, there was no way Japan wouldn’t be open to tourists by then. 

Fast forward to now. Japan isn’t open and we have to reschedule. 

The four of us canceled our tickets due to travel restrictions on March 3, 2022. 

Air Canada said we would be issued travel vouchers for the cost of our tickets - minus taxes and fees - and they would arrive between 6 to 8 weeks. 

To our surprise. On March 8th we received two travel vouchers via email. (My girlfriend and I booked our trip separately. Hence the two vouchers) They were supposed to have over $1,800 on them. There was nothing on them and it says the ‘funds have been depleted’ but we’ve yet to use them. 

We’ve sent emails and even tweeted at them. Nothing. 

We’ve called them 5 or 6 times. Each time they’ve said to wait 3 business days for the funds to show. Still nothing. 

Supposedly two customer service agents have sent urgent requests to whatever department that handles our stuff. Nothing. 

They just hung up on her after being on a call for over an hour. So frustrated. 

We’re worried we might be out of $1,800. Can they do that? Has anyone experienced this before? Or is going through it now?

I am not sure if anyone has any idea about my case but willing to hear from you people if you have any opinion on what happened with me!

So, basically back in December around the new year, I had a flight to Paris, and the flight was through Edinburg UK (transit point). my passport does not qualify me to pass the UK even through transit point without a visa but because I hold a permanent residency card of another country (which is listed under UK official website for visa) that the holder of this card can pass only through transit point (which was my case) without the need to present visa as long as they do not cross the border (which is my case too)

&amp;#x200B;

when I was checking in first, the border agent did complain about this until she checked online and made some calls then, she decided (which I thought it is totally not relevant to Ryanair because I asked about the visa requirement and they told me on the phone that it is not them who decide! even though I was according to the UK website fully legally to transit!) to give me the boarding pass and I checked in my bag and finished everything **BUT** when I reached the gate, she came to me and she did not let me go on the plane because she said, ''RYAN AIR HAS DECIDED TO NOT LET YOU FLY ON THIS PLANE BECAUSE OF THE VISA!'' I was shocked and I saw the flight in front of my eyes leaving! 

&amp;#x200B;

I did book another flight that day because I already had many other reservations in Paris that were nonrefundable too, and I filed two complaints so far about the company getting refunded for the money but ended up with nothing and they have not contacted me yet!

TravelHacks,"Hello! A friend and I are travelling to Morocco next Monday and I’m wondering if anyone has some light to shed on the vague language used to describe the PCR test window within the Moroccan travel requirements.
  
Our itinerary is to fly within Canada to a larger airport, then to Paris, and finally to Casablanca. The total trip will take about 18 hours. For the PCR tests available to us, the turn around time for results is 24-48 hours.
  
Does the 48 hour window for negative PCR tests apply to our first leg of the trip within Canada, or apply to the flight into Morocco from Paris? If we qualify once we begin travel in Canada, we’ll get a test two days before so we can guarantee our results by the time we reach Moroccan customs. If it applies to the later flight, we’ll have to get it one day before travel and pray our results don’t get delayed.

So I have a mix between an ethical and a practical question.

I am staying in a hostel in Honolulu and, being paranoid about such situations, had booked my accommodations well in advance.

My little brother (19) just arrived for a weekend trip (he lives temporarily on Big Island, so not far), and he'll be staying from today until the 6th.

Also, would it be better to ask for forgiveness from the hostel if he's caught, or be honest and ask for permission to let him stay in the courtyard?

- Clothes and carry on? I wanna be as efficient as possible and not over pack, open to buying warm clothes over there as I know my wardrobe likely won't be warm enough to survive that weather, might bring thermals to wear under everything
- Items it MUST bring and items I shouldn't
- This to remember at airports
- Cash conversion (I will likely be organising a travel car) 

Basically anything you have to say will probably help

TravelHacks,"Many of us still have unused American Airlines flight credits that are due to expire on 3/31/2022. Per the Reservations Agent that helped me tonight, American Airlines is no longer extending COVID-related Flight Credits as of 2/15/22. However, there is a workaround that will cost a small sum of money and will convert the Flight Credit to the far-superior Trip Credit!

[https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/payment-options/travel-credit.jsp#flightcreditterms](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/payment-options/travel-credit.jsp#flightcreditterms)

This link will take you to the terms and conditions for Flight Credits. Under one of the bullet points under ""Redemption and usage"" says ""If the ticket price is less than the value of the Flight Credit, you can only use the value of Flight Credit needed for the current booking **while remaining value will be issued as travel credit for future reservations**."" (it is also good for one year from the date of issuance - i.e., you get a year extension). Therefore, book a super cheap one-way ticket and immediately get a TRIP CREDIT for the remaining balance of your credit good for an entire year! Just keep in mind, when/if you cancel this cheap flight, the cost of that flight will be credited back and will expire with the original expiration date (e.g., 3/31/2022). This is a small price to pay to have the credit converted to a TRIP CREDIT and extended one full year!

I found the cheapest one-way flight available in the US via Google Flights and went to [AA.com](https://AA.com) to book it! For a measly $45, book ATL to MIA on 3/16/2022 (there are multiple flights/times with that low price).

When I went to pay with the Flight Credit, the system says I cannot redeem this credit online, I must call... So I put the flight on hold (d**on't pay for it! just select 'hold'**) and called and got it taken care of! (don't tell them you plan on missing/cancelling the flight! they don't like that)

**So, to recap:**

I started with $500 Flight Credit expiring on 3/31/2022

I booked ATL to MIA on 3/16/2022 for $45 online, making sure to pay with the credit, or if that did not work, I put the reservation on HOLD.

I called reservations and told the agent I wanted to pay for the flight with the flight credit.

Reservations paid for the $45 flight with the flight credit and issued me a new trip credit.

Now I have a Trip Credit worth $455 and expires 3/2/2022!!!",AA Flight Credit expiration workaround,1646194788

TravelHacks,"The Problem: 
Global Entry appointments can be as soon as same day or next year. Some cases never. 

A tip:
Some of us live near more than one airport. For example in Seattle we have access to SeaTac and then Portland isn’t tooo far away if necessary; Bay Area has SFO, Oakland, San Jose.. you get the drift. 

A “tip” while searching appointments is to look at multiple locations if you can. Think of your upcoming travel plans to determine if you’ll be able to visit a global entry office while traveling - it’s possible to score a sooner appointment elsewhere. 

The “hack:” 
I created a bot that looks at all global entry locations and shares its next available appointment to Twitter… all day long. All you have to do is watch for your locations next appointment, and if it’s sooner than your current slot, confirm the new one as quickly as possible and then cancel your existing appointment.

A short while ago, I took a train from Budapest to Rožnov pod Radhoštěm. That’s a small town in the Czech Republic, and probably, you’ve never heard of it. While buying a ticket, I noticed a little thing. European railway companies are now offering discounts to different age groups of passengers, for instance, young people aged 14 to 18 or young people aged 18 to 26. All these passengers can count on certain trip discounts.

Even dogs and bicycles have benefits. And that’s a fair thing. But damn! What about us? What about us, people who are over 26 facing various challenges like existential or midlife crises. As for the latter ones, car producers have designed bloody yellow cars with convertible tops. It seems life mocks us, presenting us with such dubious solutions for fighting a mental crisis.

Occasionally, I get messages from users like students asking me to provide discounts on Manyflights Premium plan. From now on, I’ve decided to introduce discounts for the people, those who are over 26. So, let justice be done:

**Existential Crisis Discount 26% off** (promo code: **SICKOFTHIS**)

**Midlife Crisis Discount 40% off** (promo code: **MIDLIFER** )

Unfortunately, they won’t help you overcome the crisis. But we believe that our system will definitely find cool flight offers for users to visit inspiring, charging, energizing places providing some momentum, possibly allowing people to regenerate, and finally make this fucking world give in to them.

Indeed, you will eventually mute your inner emotions, at least for a while, if you change your environment more often and travel to some beautiful places or remote nooks of the world. Once, I personally got some existential help from my journeys in Brazil and Mexico. You know, when some old dude chases you in his ancient Fiat somewhere on the road between Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro in some mountain village, you find yourself thinking that your psychological problems are somewhere away on board the plane. Actually, in moments like these, your worries about the meaning of life are little or none.

TravelHacks,"Hello all ^_^

If anyone is interested in buying travel health insurance, I'm an insurance agent licensed in all 50 US states, and DC, and I'd be happy to help you get some low cost travel medical insurance. US only. No, we don't make commission. 

I'm mostly interested in helping people skip the long hold times, as hold times in the travel industry are horrible right now (1+ hour hold times in many cases). With travel opening up, more countries are requiring people to have travel medical insurance to enter the country. For example, the Philippines recently opened back up, and they are requiring you to have $35,000 of travel health insurance to cover COVID-19 medical expenses. I can also help you get the required documents that allow you to enter countries with entry requirements (Costa Rica, Argentina, Philippines, BVI, Thailand, Indonesia, Israel, etc)

To build travel insurance quotes, I need the following information

1) first and last names of the travelers and DOB
2) destination
3) state of residence (you need to provide your full address to buy a policy, but I can send you a quote without your address if you feel uncomfortable providing it right away; it will have to be input eventually, though)
4) travel dates
5) email address 

A stand alone travel health insurance policy doesn't require trip cost or deposit/payment dates. These types of policies are usually cheaper than comprehensive plans because they are only factor in the state, length of trip, and DOB when pricing. I've (22 att) purchased this type of policy for as low as $10 for a weekend trip to Canada. 

The stand alone travel medical insurance policy isn't available to residents of MA, MN, NH, VA, or WA. 

I can provide comprehensive insurance too, but you'll need to provide the date on which you made your first and final payment/deposit towards the trip, and the trip cost per person. If there is no per person breakdown, just divide the trip cost evenly amongst all travelers. People with the same travel dates, and who reside in the same state, can be put on the same policy. 

Feel free to DM me, and I can start working on it. I work long days rn, so please be understanding if it takes me a little time to respond. Feel free to put ""URGENT"" at the beginning of your message if you're traveling soon so I can prioritize it.",Travel Medical Insurance,1645303653

TravelHacks,"Sorry this is so long!!

I have a new job that has a very heavy travel schedule. I had just started traveling with them when Covid grounded us. Now that we are resuming regular travel, I’ve had a chance to really think about my behaviors and things that have happened before and want to take some more intentional precautions. I’m of a certain age and demographic that is often seen as weak and easy targets. 

I have traveled often for pleasure and for business, but this will be completely different.  This will be ‘landing at midnight and either getting a rental or an Uber to the hotel three nights a week in three different states’ type of a schedule. I know once it gets mundane and monotonous I will be more likely to become complacent, and the exhaustion of constant travel will make me less alert. 

I know not to be too flashy; keep the good jewelry at home; don’t pull out the branded electronics, etc. What else can I do to keep myself safe? I’m not paranoid, but know that while the likelihood of something bad happening is fairly low, I could still have a problem. I believe ‘forewarned is forearmed’, so while I don’t let myself dwell on the bad things that could happen, I also try to be aware of my surroundings and try to take as many precautions as I can. Specifically I’m mostly concerned about two things - transportation around and out of town and safety in my hotel room. 

Sometimes I will need to drive my rental from the airport to a rural location or to another city. I try to only book travel during daylight hours when this is the case because I’m worried about getting lost in the dark or losing cell service. My husband and I have a plan in place that whenever we can, I will be on speaker with him while driving, so if something happens or I drop service, he will know immediately. We also have family sharing/location enabled on our phones. 

In large cities with higher crime rates, am I safer in a rental or an Uber? I know Uber tracks the driver, but I’ve been left waiting in some sketchy places. I’ve also had to walk to try to find the driver - while being very distracted and stressed. My job requires me to check out of my hotel in the early morning - taking my luggage to my job site where I work all day - then making a mad dash for the airport to fly out that night. This means sometimes I’m dragging my suitcase with me while trying to find my driver and I feel like I have a huge target on my back. 

I’m also a bit concerned about safety and  resting well in my hotel room. One room I was in last year had a huge air register in the closet that was large enough for a person to fit through and there was a huge crawl space/vent shaft above it. It was creepy and just made me nervous. I opened the rickety and creaky ironing board and wedged it under the closet knob. I then set the iron on the very edge of the board, creating my own blockade and alarm system- just so I could relax to get to sleep. I know to keep the door locked at all times and to call the front desk if anyone tries to access the room - and have had engineering/maintenance completely understand my precautions. Still, it’s so hard to let my guard down enough to try and get some rest. 

I am open to any suggestions or advice from other road warriors (other than quitting my job - the job is awesome!) Like - should I drop som AirTags in my luggage/purse/pockets? Should I get some sort of security device for the hotel room door - and if so, any reccs? Any other tips for air travel and living out of a suitcase a few nights each week?

TravelHacks," Havasu Falls has been a well magical place that has been featured on several calendars as well as screensavers, as well as on television, magazines, and the internet. Hiking to Havasu Falls is indeed a bucket-list activity for experienced hikers mostly on hunt for the hike of a lifetime, and it’s excellent for a night time car trip to or from Lake Havasu City. There are indeed hiking plus helicopter trips offered. Havasu Falls is frequently contrasted with Lake Havasu, which is situated on the Havasupai Indian Reservation which is just outside Grand Canyon National Park. Both of these are gorgeous water wonderlands, but getting to the trailhead for Havasu Falls from Lake Havasu City takes four to five hours. Hiking to Havasu Falls seems to be a ten-mile downhill journey from the trailhead to the waterfall. Because the route is difficult, hikers must be in amazing physical shape. Hiking to Havasu Falls may seem like a huge amount of work; however the reward is definitely worth it. Havasupai is a Native American word that means “people of the blue-green waters.” Havasu Falls cascades over 100 feet into a huge pool of crystal-clear, vivid blue-green water.

The Iceland-Stewart flight is very similar to what Wow Airlines used to do. Wow had a shuttle bus to NYC (Port Authority Bus Terminal), but the traffic can be very bad on weekdays heading into NYC in the evenings and it's 10 long blocks from Penn Station.

Here's the hack:

Stewart Airport is a 20 minute drive from Metro North's Campbell Hall train station, and catching an Uber is pretty easy. For the trip to NYC-- you need to fly in on a weekend as there are no evening trains from Campbell Hall to New York City on weekdays (there's one train that leaves Campbell Hall at 10:04 PM). The flights from Iceland are scheduled to arrive at 5:35 pm-- the two evening trains to NYC leave Campbell Hall at 6:07 and 9:20 PM. If your flight gets in early (which was most of the time for Wow) and you can get through customs security expeditiously, you'll have no problem connecting with the 6:07 train. If you miss it, there's one more train.

Taking the train \*to\* Stewart Airport is easier: the daily flight will leave at 6:45 pm. The train originates at the NJ Transit Hoboken, NJ station. You can connect with it at NJ Transit Secaucus Junction station (which connects with New York City Penn Station trains and all NJ trains)-- service is infrequent but the 2:52 pm train from Secaucus will get you there in plenty of time. On weekends, the trip to Stewart by train is worse--you need to catch the 12:35 pm from Secaucus and change trains in either Ridgewood or Suffern (get into Campbell hall at 3:03 pm).","European low-cost aviation startup Play Airlines to serve New York City via Stewart Airport (Newburgh, NY)",1643916949

TravelHacks,"Hey Reddit, I hope these tips find you well!

1. Never book for the vehicle type you want, especially when they’re in high demand. Book the lowest rate for the company you choose then upgrade at the counter without explicitly saying the type of vehicle you want. 9/10 times you will get the vehicle you want at a way lower rate than what you’d book online. It benefits the rental agent because they get bonuses based on upgrades and it saves you money.

Example: December during snow, AWD and SUV vehicles were starting at $160 a day up to 290 a day, compact or “suppliers choice” vehicles were 20-30 per day. We will offer you an upgrade to a SUV for $50-70 more per day than you were at, most people said yes but if they didn’t, we’d counter offer at about 25-30 more per day. So you get a $160+ SUV for 70-90 (or less) a day and we get a big bonus.

2. Don’t book online ahead of time, you’ll get a cheaper rate at the counter and the agent will also benefit from “walk” revenue. If the rate isn’t cheaper, any agent I know will match the going rate or less for you, especially if you’re friendly.

3. The LDW (Loss and Damage waiver) may be an upfront expense but it frees you 100% from any financial responsibility to the vehicle no matter what damage happens. For $33 per day you could total a $70,000 vehicle and walk away, no claims, deductibles and not messing with your own insurance. I highly recommend for short rentals. (Sales agents also get a % of this)

Let’s say you opt out and want to use your own insurance, totally fine. You’ll have to pay your deductible plus whatever the current day rate is on the vehicle until it is repaired and with parts/labor shortage could be weeks at a time.

4. Don’t ask for free upgrades, unless you’re a regular or had something happen and it’s for customer service, you’re not going to get it and we hate when you ask for free upgrades. 

5. Come prepared with a credit card in your name  that can hold the rental amount and security deposit, and a valid license, these are two things we can not help you with not even a little.

6. If you are under the age of $25 be prepared to pay an underage driver fee, unless government rental it can’t be waived. These typically run $25-28 per day depending on the company.

7. I’ve seen this happen many times, sliding a $10 or $20 bill in when you hand your license/credit card over to the agent will almost guarantee you a free upgrade.

8. Not admitting anything here, but from what I’ve witnessed, if you don’t qualify at one company, walk up to another, the agent at the counter is more likely to bend the rules for a walk up because they get a larger cut.",I work at a major international rental car company… here are some tips.,1643706812

roadtrip,"Hello!

Me and my partner are in the midst of planning our first roadtrip together (9/1-9/13) from LA to Portland and are looking for help concerning our itinerary and any other advice you can think of. We will be renting a car in LA and driving it one way to Eugene, OR. 

This is currently our rough itinerary.

**9/1-9/3:**

* We will be arriving in LA late the 1st, and staying these few days with a good friend. We would like to camp Joshua Tree the 2nd, and then spend the 3rd celebrating her birthday. 

**9/4:**

* Will be picking up our rental and starting the first leg of our road trip to Sequoia national park (3-4hour drive), and well as spending the day hiking and exploring. Camping within the park.

**9/5-9/6:**

* Leaving King's Canyon and making our way up to Yosemite (4hours). Staying here for a couple days. Trying to decide whether we'd like to take 2 days at Yosemite, or spend one of those days at Mammoth Lakes nearby as well. 

**9/7:**

* Leaving Yosemite for Lake Tahoe (3hours). Was considering taking the night in a cabin/hotel here to recuperate and rest up, but are there any must see campsites at the lake? 

**9/8:**

* Begin our way to the coast from Lake Tahoe to Lassen Volcanic National park (3-4hours). Not too sure about this leg of our journey, if you're aware of a better destination/route to break-up our westward crossing please let me know!

**9/9:**

* Leave Lassen for Redwood National Park (4hours). Explore and camp here as well. 

**9/10:**

* Begin our drive up the rest of the California coastline and into Oregon. No planned stop for this day, more of a buffer day. Either hotel or camp somewhere on the coast. Open to recs!

**9/11:**

* Arrive at Oregon Dunes park. Spend day here and exploring surrounding area, will most likely camp on the coast again. 

**9/12:**

* From near Oregon Dunes, arrive at my friends in Eugene, OR (1.5hour). Will return the rental and spend the day and night with him sightseeing local spots.

**9/13:**

* Return rental car and leave from Portland airport!

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to camp as many nights as possible depending on weather, and camp cook the majority of our breakfast and dinners (although restaurant recommendations are still welcome!) I would also like to know of any worth while side-stops that may be worth the detours! (particularly any hot spring baths)

My main concerns are camping reservations and whether or not we have the time to see everything. I know camping within the parks might be difficult to find reservations this close out to the trip, but is camping permitted off trails or on national land?  Also, is this a realistic itinerary to follow? It seems doable, but I know it will be different in practice and I would rather not spend each day too exhausted to explore.

Hey guys! 
Me and my Husband are planning a road trip. We live in Phoenix, Arizona (just moved here in June). His mother and stepdad are gonna take care of our son for just over a week so we can have our late honeymoon. We’ve been looking at a few places and so far we like Laguna Beach, CA, Moab, UT, and Puerto Peñasco, Mexico. Both of us would like to experience being outside the United States. He’s never been outside of the US and the last time I left the US I was 3 going to Canada. We both think Puerto Peñasco is beautiful and it’s closer than our other 2 choices (only 3-4 hours away). We both have passports. The only thing making us unsure is safety. We don’t know any Spanish besides basics, and I’ve also heard people say it isn’t safe to drive there because of cartel/crime stuff. But I’ve seen videos of people getting there w/o problems. So I guess my question is, would it be a good/safe idea to drive there? What precautions should we take and what should we be aware of? Have any of you guys taken the drive there? Sorry if this comes across ditsy or dumb. I’ve been trying to find out more information but I’m finding a whole bunch of different advice and information.

Bit of an odd question so apologies if this isn’t the right sub (x-posted to r/Car_Insurance_Help, r/roadtrip). 

**Question**: If I go on a cross-country roadtrip, can I get Maryland insurance on a car that is titled &amp; registered in NYC if I don’t intend on returning? 

Background: 

In August I will be departing for a Maryland -&gt; CA coast road trip. I’ll be spending 6-8 weeks on the road, visiting different National Parks &amp; cities throughout before I eventually finish in SF. 

I purchased a car in June and have titled &amp; registered in NYC (where I currently reside). In August, I will be moving out and storing all my belongings in a storage facility in MD nearby to my parents. I will also put their house as my temporary address. I’ll be in MD less than a week before I depart. 

Car insurance in MD is about 30% of that in NYC ($75 vs $200 per month) so it would make a huge difference to switch insurance if I can. 

Is this feasible? Who else can I talk to in order to get an expert opinion (DMV or Tag &amp; Title service)?

I've done the Iowa-Nebraska thing and don't care to do that again. Contemplating routes through North or South Dakota to start... then either cutting north into Montana and northern Idaho, or a more straight-shot route through Wyoming and southern Idaho.

* Priorities include scenic areas and dark skies, though I may only be camping once or twice, if at all
* I hear there are nice sunflower fields in ND and SD, but it might be a crapshoot as to whether we pass them
* I have vague ideas about detours through the some combination of Badlands, Black Hills, and Devils Tower ... but this is more a functional drive rather than a roadtrip
* Prefer the more central route through Oregon. I think the route pictured goes through Burns, but I would probably take one a bit to the north to go through John Day / Painted Hills

Anyways I was on Reddit the other day and I saw a casual mention of the upcoming 2024 eclipse. My mind immediately went to “I have a roadtrip planned for 2024!  I wonder if I’ll be close?” And lo and behold I will be. I was thinking of going to the SE US to capture the remaining states in the lower 48 I’ve yet to visit, in the spring of that year (because I’ve been told summer will be too hot). I put a map of my planned route on top of the eclipse path and it intersects in two places: Indianapolis, and NE Arkansas near the Missouri border (on US-63 between West Plains, MO and Pocahontas, AR). 

I’m thinking of making the exact time for the road trip now to correspond with the eclipse and I’m wondering if that would be a good idea. Has anyone else toad tripped during such an event?  (I’m thinking of hitting the Arkansas portion on the day rather than the Indianapolis one as there’s be way more people stopped on the highway to look as it’s a big city rather than in the country).

roadtrip,"Hi, first time in US and I'd like to go on a car roadtrip from Dallas to LA and need some suggestions. I haven't worked out all the details of my travel but I'll definitely fly back to EU from LAX.

I'm only bound by time as I've got about 7-8 days max.

1. How expensive/cheap is it to rent a car and would it be possible to drive the same thing through all the states? Do I have to return it to the renting point or perhaps there are ones at every airport etc.

2. Is there something like a simcard that would give me data for the whole duration of the trip? Like a disposable 7-15-30 day simcard would do.

3. Any suggestions and places I should visit or avoid? 

4. Is it viable in 7 days? Google says 20hour drive so I guess I should be more than fine?

**Khasab Travel Guide**

Khasab is a town in Musandam Governorate, Oman. It has many popular attractions including Musandam, Bassa Public Beach, Festung Cacapo, which is well worth the trip.

**Get Ready To Have the Time of Your Life on Our Musandam Tour**

If you are looking for an unforgettable travel experience, look no further than Musandam Tours. Based in Dubai, our travel agency Musandam, Oman offers a range of packages that allow you to explore this beautiful region. Whether you are interested in a day trip or a longer night tour to Musandam from Dubai, we have a perfect excursion for you. And because we are located in Dubai, getting to Musandam is easy and convenient.

Musandam Khasab Trip is a unique tour package as the city is popular for its scenic beauty and natural splendour. The beautiful Musandam Peninsula is an enclave of Oman, separated from the rest of the country by the United Arab Emirates.

After looking at photos of Musandam Khasab trip by my friends, I fell in love with the scenic beauty of the charming town and decided to take my own trip the following weekend. I booked my trip to Musandam Khasab online MVH. I was picked up from Dubai and the trip started early in the morning.

I enjoyed the drive to Musandam Khasab via Ras Al Khaimah as the view outside became more and more appealing as we approached the town. The souks on the way to Musandam Khasab had an impressive collection of antiques and handicrafts. The trip was amazing and adventurous, through coastal roads. We were able to spot Bedouin villages which are also breathtakingly beautiful.

I couldn't believe my eyes when we arrived at Musandam Khasab, the atmosphere was so romantic and endearing, the colorful mountains, crystal clear waters and cool weather made me think I was in a fairyland . Along with the other tourists, I boarded the traditional Omani dhow, cruising slowly along the azure waters. The configuration on board was comfortable, I looked and breathed in the beauty that surrounds the whole place; it was the most calming experience, blending into the beauty of nature.

In the thin shallow waters I swam, tried snorkeling and curiously watched the rare and cute sea creatures, fishing was fun in the waters, I released the fishes myself in water after catching them. I went on board with pleasure for lunch. The buffet lunch was great, with barbecued meats and salads, the traditional Omani dishes were divine and I looked out over the vast horizon and loved every minute of the trip. The cruise lasted a while and I relaxed on deck, basking in the rays of the sun. When the tourists returned to Khasab, I felt a special connection to the city and reluctantly joined them with plans to visit the place in the near future.

**Why Choose Our Musandam Travel Packages?**

The Musandam Peninsula is truly a natural wonder. With its dramatic mountains, pristine beaches and crystal clear waters, it's no wonder this region is often called the ""Norway of Arabia"".

I am wondering if I70 has any change in scenery or if it’s just flat nothingness like I80? Also how is the semi traffic on I70? I found myself getting annoyed after the 10th semi cut someone off to go a mile or two faster than the other truck while on I80.

Maybe more important, if you had two pets in the car, would you rather do I80 and get there an hour or two faster over the course of 2 days or take I70?

I can’t seem to narrow down what to do for the long weekend coming up. I’ll have an extra day or 2 to add to make a 4 to 5 days total trip possible. I’m open to Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, southern Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana Iowa or any destination under 7 hours from Chicago. 

Some of the places I’ve been to is northern Wisconsin, traverse city in MI, Indianapolis and part of Eastern Iowa(caves). I’m hoping to discover a new place or do something unique in a place I’ve been to.

Places I’m considering are anywhere in Minnesota, Detroit and Ohio since I’ve never been but open to all ideas. I also haven’t ruled out a short flight to a unique destination that’s under 2 to 3 hours. 

Things I love to do is visit unique live music venues, hiking, picturesque drives, spending time at the beach and really open to any unique/ local experiences.

I’ll be coming from the twin cities in MN and I’m trying to decide between the PNW (Seattle, Olympic National Park, Portland, etc.) or going down from San Francisco to San Diego. I know I could probably make Seattle to San Diego happen, but I’d prefer to be able to spend some time in the areas I visit and not rush through. 

I’m torn between the two trips and whichever one I don’t do I will probably try to make happen next year. But here’s some of the reasons I’m going back and forth. 

- I tend to enjoy the outdoors/national parks a little bit more than the touristy cities, but I’m worried because I’m going alone that I won’t be able to do much hiking while I’m in PNW.

- I’ve been to LA before and would probably skip it. Any other recommendations along the California coast aside from San Francisco and San Diego?

- Weather. It would be nice to enjoy some beach days in Southern California before we’re hit by the frozen tundra that is MN winters.

- Portland and Seattle seem like good cities for a solo traveler.

We (my wife, my 4yr old and my 3yr old and myself)  are fortunate enough have about 10 weeks to travel in Australia from the start of october until halfway through september, after working myself to the edge of insanity during COVID over the past few year, being a Chest Physician. Really looking forward to this, but since i never been to Australia and since we haven't been travelling with the kids other then two weeks at the beach, any tips  are most welcome.  
We'll try to limit the days where we ll travel over 300 km (200 miles) since we ll usually be able to find a beach along the way, and the kids (and me) are fond of animals, sand &amp; water  
We re not sure yet if we want to make a big road trip from Cairns to Adelaide or stop at Sydney, stay there for a bit and then head back, or continue driving to Melbourne of even Adelaide.

Top End  
Our plan is to start with a week in the Top End. We ll be flying in from Bali to Darwin and i figure we ll be spending about 7-10 days there, planning to go to Kakadu (which is huge... what to focus on? ) Lithchfield and Darwin itself. (I figure i'd need to rent a decent 4WD?)

QLD  
After the first week or so we ll fly to Cairns, we'll spend about a week in the region here. I ll do some diving, we'll head to Daintree (maybe Cape Tribulation) and Kuranda.  
I would be tempted to spend more time here, but our schedule might become a bit tight then later on

After Cairns we ll head to Mission Beach, and then Townsville for 2-3 days and we might go to Magnetic Island.

Then we ll head to the Whitsunday Island where we ll spend 4-5 days on Hamilton Island (is that worth is or should we base ourselves on Arlie Beach or in somewhere near?

We will head from the Whitsundays to Hervey Bay in  5 days ( visiting Eungella and the Town 1770 along the way) for some whale spotting and then 3 days on Fraser Island.

Then we'll visit Noosa  and Brisbane (planning just a day there of would that be way too little), and the  we ll head to Lamington national park for another 4 days.

NSW  
We ll visit Byron Bay - Coffs Harbor -Port Stevens on our way to Hunter Valley where we plan to say in  a (few) vineyard(s) with accomomdation. Any tip is welcome. After that we ll head to the Blue Mountains for a few days and Sydney after.

  
If you ve managed to read this far, thank you.

And here we have our main questions:

1. we ll have about 3 weeks left (little over) to either spend in Syndney or to continue travelling to Melbourne and/or Adelaide. I'd prefer the last, the wife isn t as sure. What would/should convince her?

 2. I m not sure if we re either taking too much or not enough time (about 7 weeks from Cairns to Sydney) , suggestions?

7/6: Pick up a car in Vegas, stop in Valley of Fire on the way to Zion. If time do a quick hike in Zion.

7/8: Morning in Zion, make our way to Bryce for horseback riding in the afternoon.

roadtrip,"Driving from Florida to Washington state to move our friend into our ADU. They’re originally from the AZ desert so we thought it would be nice to drive through their old stomping grounds by taking the mostly southern route.

Where the sanity check comes in: driving through the desert… in August. I’ve done this drive before but it was in early winter.

Is this just a terrible idea? We’re planning on taking 6-8 days for the trip (stopping only for gas/sleep and a couple landmarks a few miles off the intended path.

Here’s the rough draft of the plan:

*Day 1: Florida to Jackson, MS - 12 hours
*Day 2: Jackson, MS to Oklahoma City (via 71/Talimena Scenic Drive - viewing the Ozarks) - 10 hours
*Day 3: Oklahoma City to Petrified Forest - 11 hours
*Day 4: Petrified Forest to Salt Lake City (passing through painted desert and stopping by four corners monument) - 10 hours


(possibly split Day 3 and Day 4 into 2 each?)


*Day 5: Salt Lake City to either Boise ID or the Dalles, depending on if Days 3 and/or 4 were split - passing by the Salt Flats and through park in Twin Falls ID we saw last time but didn’t get to really stop and look - 5 - 10 hours
*Day 6: on to home! - 4 hours from the Dalles, 8 hours from Boise

(Boise was just picked arbitrarily based on distance: actual ideal destination would be the Dalles because it’s a beautiful drive)

Other notes: I am the only driver. I’m fine driving up to 12 hours/day (I can do even longer but my passengers end up complaining lol). Intention is some camping but hotels once in the desert area.

8 days is a hard stop. I’d like to take it a little easier but that’s how long we could get care for our pets. :)

I’m going on a road trip this summer, and I’m finalizing some stops. 

The trip is divided into 3, the first leg being from Atlanta to Seattle, where I’m staying for about a week. The second is from Seattle to San Diego, where I’m staying for another week, and then I’ll finish up in Atlanta. 

We are doing a hybrid of tenting and hotels, but keeping hotels to a minimum (#collegelife). Because of this, I would like to keep the second leg to 1 hotel. 

I planned on the second leg being 3 nights and 4 days long. From Seattle to the redwood national forest, then to San Fran, then Yosemite, and finishing it up in San Diego. 

However, the redwood national forest is out of campsites. So, I need to figure out how to stop somewhere in that general area and where to camp.

Also I want to drive on 101 for a lot of the way because I’ve heard it is the prettiest view. So, I would prefer if that works, although not a huge deal breaker necessarily. 


I also need to make some stops in Texas (2 I think. It’ll just be me for this portion, so I want to be sure I don’t over extend myself) in between the Guadalupe Mountains and New Orleans.

My husband and I are taking our kids on a road trip this summer to visit my Amish family and others.

I’ve (35f) done this trip dozens of times in my life driving, but never as a parent driving (we flew last time) and it’s a first for my DH (35m) and kids (10y m, 8y f, 3.5y m) 

I don’t want to miss anything amazing.

This won’t be the last trip out we do driving so all ideas are helpful, even if we can’t hit them this time!

We’ve worked out our route talking with my parents based on what’s a good drive, has things to see, and won’t add a crazy amount of extra driving.
I have added the app “roadtrippers” to utilize as well (haven’t set it up but it was highly recommended online) 

Route plan is from BC through Seattle then onto 90 to 82 to 84.

Take 84 to 80 in Utah and continue into that till Illinois and get to 74 and meander up to the town we are staying in with family.
Reason for not doing 90 is we’ll take that home and I do not want to go through Chicago on the way there…insert much PTSD from summer no AC trips in Chicago highway traffic.
We will go through Chicago on the way from IN to WI and stay overnight near the field museum and spend a day there… so don’t worry ;) we aren’t missing it totally… just timing it particularly.

On the way home we will go either 94 till 90 in Montana or just 90 the whole way till WA 

I know about craters of the moon in Idaho, Cody Wyoming for Yellowstone, keystone, deadwood, Mt Rushmore, badlands, black hills, Mitchell SD Corn palace

Looking for younger kid friendly ideas. 

We don’t have a crazy amount of extra time each direction (more heading there then home) 
But thought if we could plan our meal stops and night stops at POI then that would help.

Full disclosure for our crazy timeline is we are going from BC through Seattle area June 29th to get past the computer chaos at night.
Then Start the full drive morning of June 30th with the expectation to be in northern IN by July 4th

Yup it’s fast… but our family is used to driving and road trips so we are very confident with our timeline… but want advice on crazy weird roadside tourist traps (we want them!!) and fun stop offs.

For the second leg, I'm trying to decide whether to head south at Dickinson and travel through Wyoming to get there (probably stopping in Casper for the nighte) OR keep going along 94/90 through Montana, with a night in Bozeman and then heading south to SLC.

I have a feeling the Montana route is more scenic but here's the tricky part. I have a bad fear of heights so would like to avoid really high passes if possible.

roadtrip,"I worked out the costs for a trip from VA to FL and back, and the cheapest option (after estimating gas costs) seems to be flying there and driving back.

Reddit has given me both ""one-way from airport to airport has no additional fees"" and ""one-way rentals are incredibly expensive and there's no way around it"". Booking online with the ""drop off at different location"" selection shows regular daily rates (no one-way fee), but I am not able to pay online.

roadtrip,"Some context:

Digital Nomad currently living in NYC. Have no car. Can afford 1 or 2 month rentals on Turo from the cheapest options (i.e. around $1k for a month rental). Haven't tried asking family/friends but I feel hesitant about that. Have already been to Boston, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. Not much of a night life kinda guy(clubs, parties etc). I do like cities, but also very much love spending a day or two in nature. Huge foodie and lover of craft beer. Big history and culture nerd, so places like Appalachia would definitely be interesting for me to see. Places like Acadia would also be nice. I don't want the trip to be solely city or nature, but a nice mix. Don't like extreme heat or humidity.

I'd be moving out of my apartment as soon as I start the trip (no lease so I can move out when I please), so no rent obligations. I have a trip planned for Taiwan in the first two weeks of October. I'd need to be back in NJ so I could pack for that trip. I'd also need to return to NJ for Thanksgiving with my family. 

When's the best time to start the trip, and how long is enough for what I want to do? A month? two months? Mind you, I'll still be working during the trip. I work 9-5 with no overtime, only Mon-Fri. Should I rent an SUV hybrid and do a mix of sleeping in the car and airbnb rentals? Or would it be simpler to just rent a prius and find places to sleep for the nights?

I want my trip to start in New England. That's something I'm sure of. I really want to see Portland Maine and acadia",Need help building a cross country road trip for the Fall season. Can't decide when to start my trip and how to go about it.,1654198441
roadtrip,"Driving to the Outer Banks (Kill Devil Hills) end of the month from  CT and hoping for some tips/advice on my driving route.

I am stopping for one night to break the trip up and for some photo opps in the morning in the Chincoteague/Assateague area; staying in Snow Hill MD.

Main question is whether to take 95 all the way or to take what I think would be the more scenic route along route 34 and route 9, avoiding the major cities, and including the Cape May - Lewes ferry which would give me a little driving break.

You can be as alone or seek conversation as you please.

The Springs itself has a very large pool which is open 24 hours. It's also a small General Store if you need it but you need to bring your own food for the most part. They have a communal kitchen which has everything you need to cook or barbecue.
Coffee always. The place itself is pretty casual, it is Eastern Oregon after all.
It takes a bit of effort to get here so most people are pretty friendly about it.

roadtrip,"It was 11 pm at night, and I was driving 80 mph down Interstate 25, in New Mexico. I am driving in the left (passing) lane, when I notice two cars coming up in the distance fast, both with their brights on. I move to the right (slow) lane to let them pass, which they both do. After passing me and the car in front of me at a high speed, the first car (Gray Sedan) then cuts in front of the car in front of me, and then slows down, and the second car (White Van) immediately squeezes in between gray sedan and the car in front of me. White Van is following very closely and aggressively behind gray sedan. I notice this as strange behavior but continue to drive... both have slowed down but I am reluctant to pass them. Finally, I decide I want to lose them, so I pass them going 90 mph and hope to lose them because I am uncomfortable driving ahead of them with them both having their brights on. I stay ahead of them for a bit, until gray sedan suddenly speeds past me, only to cut me off and then proceed to slow down significantly. This time, white Van doesn't get in front of me, but stays behind me with the brights on. I stay behind gray sedan for a bit, but then decide to again pass gray sedan because gray sedan is going slow and white Van is tailing me with the brights on. So I pass gray sedan at a high speed and again try to lose them both. But then I tell my sister, ""why don't we just pull over and let them all go so we can drive in peace"", and then pull to the side of the road. Gray Sedan passes me, immediately slows down, puts on hazard lights, and pulls to the side of the road about 300 feet in front of me. Behind me, white sedan puts on hazard lights and pulls right up behind me, about 10 feet behind me. I suddenly feel a wave of fear and dread, and I pull back onto the highway and hightail it out of there as fast as my car will let me. The two of them do not immediately follow me back onto the highway, and I go so fast that I do not know if, or when, they got back onto the highway. 

From then on, I'm scared and I want to reach my destination, so I'm going 95-100 mph. About 30 miles later, a completely different (blue?) car merges onto the highway with their brights on. They were going slow when I passed them, but then I look in my rearview and notice that this car is now tailgating me, at 100 mph, in the right (slow) lane, with their brights on. I am feeling even more anxious at this point and I just keep driving. I am not going to pull over to let them pass because maybe that's the point. For about 10 miles, this car tailgates me with the brights on in the slow lane going 100 mph on an empty interstate. Then as we approach another exit, this car suddenly turns off the brights, slows down, and exits off the interstate. 

And then about 30 miles later, we pass a car pulled over right behind another car, and a third car pulled over a couple hundred feet ahead of the other two. The car a couple hundred feet ahead has hazard lights on, the car right behind has hazard lights on, and the car in the middle has no lights on.

4. No tolls in PA till Pittsburgh. Toll road from beyond Pittsburgh, PA to the Maryland border
5. No tolls from Maryland Border onward

1. Can I just pay the tolls in cash/credit card for these sections (OK and PA), without having to buy a pass (I know it is EZ pass in PA, not sure what it is in OK)?

2. Anyone who's disabled and immunocompromised have general tips or recommendations for getting through a long road trip? Pain management, food ideas, neck pillows, anything!
3. This may be a long shot because most people don't track the bathrooms they use. **Does anyone have recommendations for bathrooms that are unenclosed/well-ventilated?**   
Like the one at the top of [this article](https://publicrestroomcompany.com/park-restroom-design-considerations/). (i.e. restrooms with large undercuts or overcuts). While I have no problem peeing on random stretches of road, I don't want to risk contaminating soil or water with #2. The issue is that public bathrooms are a [transmission risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192832/) due to [poor ventilation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00166-0) and [aerosolization](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0040310).

roadtrip,"Hi all. Arriving into Santander on the ferry next week and looking to indirectly meander down to the in-laws in the Algarve, this time exploring the northern Spanish coastal regions and northern half of Portugal. My partner and I are 30-somethings, like to make food and drink a big part of our trips (especially tapas/pintxos and other simple, local delights, and occasionally something fancier), as well as a dose of culture, nightlife, people-watching and generally exploring towns and villages.

We were in San Sebastián shortly before the pandemic and loved the general vibe and food scene, but it’s too far east to revisit this time and keen to find new gastronomic pleasures. Thinking we may detour slightly and head to Bilbao for a couple of nights, likewise Porto has long been on my hit list so maybe another couple of nights there too. Going to have a final night in Lisbon but have been there several times (big fan) so will take a back seat this trip. So that leaves two or three nights to enjoy elsewhere, and they don’t necessarily have to all be cities - we’ll be stopping off at places of interest between our overnight locations, so ending our day in a sleepy fishing village is fine.

Wondering whether to incorporate places like Santiago dC, some of the Douro, Oviedo, Cudillero and other villages on the Asturias coastline, Vigo, Comillas, Santillana, etc etc. Obviously it’s a large area that you could spend much, much longer exploring, so need to filter it down into a realistic week-long road trip.

I’m usually drawn to spending more time in Spain as the food and culture always feels a little more complex and developed than Portugal but maybe I’ve spent too much time in the Algarve and need to discover more of the real Portugal in the north.

Obviously roadtrip requires great coverage. But I am also trying to optimize how I obtain the SIM.

Hi! 

By the time this trip comes, we're a early-mid 30's newlywed Welsh/Aussie couple who agreed we would love to see the South, so we are doing a one-way car rental for about two weeks in September. 

Some of our planning was from advice I read on other Reddit posts and this has been incorporated into our plans - but seeing if there's anything worth doing/seeing/detouring for?

We love food, alcoholic beverages (we have a few, but rarely drink to excess), exploring different cultures, live music and sports (I'm a lifelong MLB and NFL fan) and sometimes nature. We have inner conflict in that we enjoy learning about history but do not like museums. 

I would love to see some minor league baseball, but from what I researched, I couldn't see much syncing with our plan (apart from the Savannah Bananas, but I'm not sure if I'd enjoy that).

Our current itinerary:

* Arrive from NYC
* 2 nights Orlando (theme parks)
* 1 night Savannah
* 2 nights Charleston
* 2 nights Asheville
* 1 night Gatlinburg
* 3 nights Nashville (have tix to see my NFL teams season opener)
* 1 night Memphis
* 2 nights New Orleans
* 1 night Lake Charles 
* 3 nights Austin - thinking either a Longhorns game or a rodeo in San Antonio. Also Franklin BBQ
* Then off to Oaxaca Mexico, to eat some more",Our 'let's circumvent Atlanta tour',1652754014

Further refined my road trip planned for the whole of August of this year - leaving Texas and driving to Vancouver along the West coast in 4 weeks. Driving will be me and my girlfriend. We aim to camp (boondock) in our SUV about 4 nights a week and stay in motels / organised campgrounds about 3 nights a week. 

Route pic and route stops listed below. If anyone has any suggestions or modifications about roads to take, things to do along the way, places to eat, etc I'd be happy to head. 

Some questions:

1. Is the distance and planned route feasible for 4 weeks? Probably looking at spending around 65% of our time on the San Francisco - Vancouver leg just because of what interests us and for fear of potential overcrowding / heat at the NPs in the southwest. 
2. What if any reservations do I need to make now? Specifically concerned about campgrounds and admission in the NPs in Utah. This to us is not the main purpose of the trip so ideally looking at spending a few days in one of them (probably Zion, although open to suggestions) and just driving through the others. 
3. How easy will it be to find places to park and camp along the west coast? 

Appreciate all and any advice!

we are a young couple from Italy, and this will be our first time in the US. I'm here to look for all the tips/suggestions/whatever things you have for me :)

The following is the road trip we've planned (and booked) with a travel agency. Initially, it was a bit different, but then my wife and I have found that we are going to become parents in few months, so we had to make some changes :)

We will rent a car from the 3rd of June and we will have it till the 14th. This is the program:

* 31st of May: arrival in SF at 11am. Stay in SF until 3rd of Jun. (3 nights)
* 03rd of Jun: SF -&gt; Monterey (1 night)
* 04th of Jun: Monterey -&gt; Santa Barbara (1 night)
* 05th of Jun: Santa Barbara -&gt; Furnace Creek (1 night)
* 06th of Jun: Furnace Creek -&gt; Las Vegas (1 night)
* 07th of Jun: Las Vegas -&gt; Joshua Tree NP (1 night)
* 08th of Jun: JTNP -&gt; San Diego (3 nights)
* 11th of Jun: San Diego -&gt; Santa Monica (3 nights)
* 14th: leaving from Los Angeles at 2pm.

Some questions that come to my mind are:

1. as I saw that the traffic and parking is really bad in SF and LA, do you think it would make sense to go around using public transportation instead of using the car? Or is it manageable to drive around in those big cities?
2. are there any ""must avoid/dangerous"" areas in SF and LA that we should know about?
3. on the 5th of June, when will we drive from SB to Death Valley, we were planning to drive on the following roads: 178+395 (to Lone Pine) and then 136+190 to Furnace Creek. The road 178 seems nicer than the highway 14. Would it makes sense or would it just be a waste of time?

I'm planning an epic road trip around US for potentially 4-5 months, seeing all 48 continental states (is that the right term). Lots of miles, lots of stops, a major bucket list trip. I'm from the UK and it doesn't seem possible to just buy a car to sell at the end without jumping through many many hoops. Has any one else done something like this and what did you find to be the best car rental option? Should I do a few smaller one way hires so I'm not putting massive mileage on a car in a short time? Start and finish in the same place in the same car that I've put 18k miles on? Is there something totally different that would work better that I haven't thought about? I'm not keen to rent an RV or similar as I will be in several cities and am a bit worried about being able to park it. 

There will be times I'm in a city for a couple of days and perhaps wouldn't need a car. Is it worth making those sections one way trips for the sake of a few days where I'm not using it, but get a one way rental extra charge? Has anyone tried to swap cars mid-rental period so it's not all on the one vehicle? My inclination is to rent one vehicle the entire time but maybe the internet knows better.

It's myself (37M), my 8yo daughter, and our 10yo flatulent dog. We normally do a different route but wanted a change of pace and to save some $$ by camping. 

I'm hoping to get some help in making sure that I plan correctly, so that I can ensure that I will be able to find a place to camp and set up with fairly easy access to the highways. Booking hotels online makes travel so easy that I forgot how to plan without using them!

Here is my general plan:

June 13th, arrive in Wall SD, do touristy stuff, then camp in the Badlands National Park, just south of town, It's my understanding that dispersed camping is allowed along the roadside, is this correct?

June 14th, camp at Smithville lake north of Kansas City. Are campsites able to be reserved? is dispersed camping allowed? 

June 15th, camp in the Danial Boone National Forest outside of Lexington KY. Are campsites able to be reserved, is dispersed  camping allowed?

On June 16th we would arrive at our destination in NC.

 My partner and I will be driving from Anchorage, Alaska to Southern California over 3 weeks. I was hoping to get advice on the Canada/Pacific Northwest (specifically Washington) aspects of our trip as we are pretty set on what to see on our way out of Alaska . Been living in Alaska for awhile and even longer in California.

We're most excited about driving the Alcan and visiting the Canadian National parks and experiencing the small towns between so any tips on that portion would be great. Mostly looking for recommendations such as must-do day hikes and anything really special along the way. We want to maximize the time we spend in the more beautiful areas and drive straight through what's not really worth seeing in comparison.  We also were thinking of squeezing in a overnight backpacking trip towards the end of our drive either in Olympic National Park or North Cascades national park. We have a set deadline of being back in California on May 20. We want to find a nice balance between a leisurely pace where we don't feel like we're mad dashing everywhere and not going too slow to where we might lose time in other areas.

I have campsites/a hostel/hipcamps booked up until AZ. As of now I don't plan to sleep in my car unless I have to. I have a Toyota Corolla, so not a ton of room. 

I'm just looking for any general advice or stories of people who have done similar things. Definitely a little nervous to start the trip, but I know it'll be worth it once i'm out there. I'm following this guide for stuff to bring [https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/road-trip-checklist.html](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/road-trip-checklist.html).

Day 3 - Zion - Hike and sleep in springdale

Day 4 - GC North Rim - Visit GCNR and travel to st. George for hotel

Day 5 - Death Valley - Explore DV a little bit, as it can already be extremely hot. Preferably stay somewhere east of DV to avoid having to drive back (Haven't found a hotel yet, Pahrump is mainly recommended)

Day 6 - Mammoth Lake - Drive to Mammoth lake, not much else planned yet on that day

Day 7 - Enter yosemite park via Tioga pass (IF OPEN START JUNE), hike and travel to Mariposa

Day 8 - Yosemite park full day, sleep at Mariposa

Day 9 - SF - Travel and sleep

Day 10 - SF

Day 11+12 - Travel west coast highway 1 towards LA, sleep at 2 places (Any tips where to sleep? Big Sur, Half moon bay, Santa cruz, Monterey, Santa barbara?)

Day 15 - Travel back to Vegas + sleep

Would it even be possible to do in something like 4-5 weeks, driving 5-6 hours a day on average? I've heard you're most of the times not allowed to take rentals over multiple state borders, so would we have to rent different cars in every other state if the VW doesn't work out?

Great Plains highlights? Storm chasing possible during this time of year? Definitely want to catch a cubs game at Wrigley and the timing might be right that I’ll be in town for Lollapalooza that July 28th weekend.

Final stretch would be Chicago to DC where I live and by that point I’ll likely just want to get home and have seen many highlights from that side of the country already so.

Now, I don't know what will happen in the heat of the moment given how loosely-planned I'm making this trip on purpose, but I need some advice for finding good camping spots.

Since dispersed camping is almost always first-come-first-serve, I obviously can't confirm whether or not it will be full by the time we get there. This trip we are basically going from campsite to campsite (ideally), leaving from one in the morning and arriving at one just before sunset. The latter part of this routine is the challenging part, effectively eliminating most campsites that require you to check in at 2-3:00 in the afternoon. Car camping is likely not an option (as my two travel buddies are also men over 6 foot, we won't fit in my SUV), and we really just need a place to pitch a tent and sleep.

I've had problems searching the arguably archaic and poorly-maintained National Forest Service's website, and most campgrounds I've found are either ""closed"" (as in the last update posted range from like September of last year to as far back as mid-2020). The ones that are listed as open often seem to get crowded very quickly. Any help will be appreciated!

roadtrip," I have an elderly parent (early-mid 70's)  who has cancer but has normal quality of life right now (no pain, nausea or etc).  She is having her treatments changed after the old one lost its effectiveness.  The new one gives her about a 3 week window between treatments, rather than weekly treatments.

Because of the opportunity to have a 3 week window now, I'm thinking about taking her to Michigan to visit her other child and family there.  We have a pet that would have to come with us, so my options are:

1. Have her fly and I make the 3 day drive with our pet and meet her there.  Although COVID restrictions have relaxed or lifted in many places, and the newest strain while more contagious seem to be less lethal, I'm wondering if flying would still be the better choice vs the other options below?  I read that within an airplane cabin, there is a constant air circulation and quality air filters are used.  There is also the ability to use one's air vent to blow air between you and the person in the seat next to you, to act as a barrier of sorts.  I hear it might be relatively safe on the plane itself but wonder about walking through crowded terminals and waiting for the plane.
2. Rent a smaller RV (one with a little bathroom) and drive us all there in about 3 day's time, thus avoiding higher concentration of people, except at stops to buy more groceries or what not.  But that will eat away at least 6 days to the road trip itself, which could be days spent at the target destination if flying.  On the other hand, it could be a relaxing, scenic experience for passengers.
3. Take my car or rent a car one way, stop overnight at hotels.  This would prevent wear and tear on my car.  It's a reliable car, but it's 8 years old and perhaps something like a mini-van would be more comfortable for the long trek. 

Of course, we'd consult with the doctor first to see if there would be any concerns about making such a trip first.  The concern on our end would be that while she is mobile and physically not really symptomatic, should something come up during the trip, her access to her hospital (or network) would be compromised.

Just wondering what you experienced travelers would choose.

Hi all,

We are a group of 3 Canadians (males, young 20s) looking to explore the west coast of the US for the first time. We are looking to go on a road trip from **June 4-12** along the west coast but wanted to raise a few questions to anyone who might have done a similar trip.

1. Where should we begin from? Seattle &gt; LA or LA &gt; Seattle? I realize this might sound trivial to ask but I think it could impact the availability of the RV / SUV and the cost (I'm assuming it might be more expensive to rent an RV from LA to drive to Seattle, but that there could be more RV options to choose from in LA). In terms of interests, we definitely lean towards spending more time in LA, so I also feel like starting in LA and spending time there first would be better than if we were to get there last and realize we didn't have enough time left to explore.
2. To rent an RV or a Car? We **don't necessarily have a budget** so the cost isn't in consideration. I'm more so thinking about parking (in the city, anywhere, etc.), safety (is it safe to park in \[any city along the way\] in a parking lot), the hassles that come with an RV (none of us have been on an RV trip before), and the current availability to campgrounds.
3. Where should we **stop by**? We're outdoorsy but also like going out at night and socializing with others (can we find similarly aged people at an RV campground?). Would like some pointers on cities / parks / points of interest to stop by given our time frame of \~8 days.

I'm planning a big drive through Europe, and thought to ask here for anything that I may not have considered, and some general help and advice.

A bit of background: Myself, my wife and 6 animals will be in the car, along with our stuff.

I know what route I want to take, and we are in the process of booking places to stay along the way. And i'm already aware that the train and boat from France into the UK only allows a maximum of 5 animals per vehicle, and I plan on using the train with 5 animals while my wife takes one on the ferry.

We are planning (very roughly at the moment) a drive from our home in Greece to just outside of Belgrade, crossing through North Macedonia, then from Serbia into Austria crossing through Hungary, and then Austria into Belgium crossing through Germany. And the last day will be Belgium into France, train/ferry into the UK and then a few hours to our destination. 

My questions are:

a) Is there anything along this route that you guys know of that we need to be aware of, or would be helpful before we set off?

b) Where do I find out how long (on average) border crossings between certain countries take?

c) Is there any way of finding out the total cost of tolls, or buying toll passes for certain countries? and do the Vingette sticker for Hungary and Austria cover the cost of tolls?

d) Is there anything that we need for certain countries between Greece and France?

e) What is the best way to plan routes and stops and all the appropriate things for a big journey like this? Have you guys used any good apps or websites or anything like that?

**tl;dr**: Buy and register the car in Quebec, Canada!

I  am a British citizen who spent a long time trying to find out how to do  this before I left for North America earlier this year.  However, while  I found a lot of discussion, I was unable to find anything definitive.   The prospect can pretty quickly seem overwhelming, and Google searches  return very expensive solutions to getting around the bureaucracy (see  e.g. [this website](https://www.visitor.us/resources/how-to-register-a-vehicle-in-the-united-states-as-a-non-us-resident)).

But **don't worry, it is possible**.  I know this because I've done it!

I'm  now in the USA and the proud, legal owner of a Kia that I am in the  process of driving all the way to Alaska.  I thought I would set down on  the record how I did this in the hope that others seeking to do  something similar might find it useful.

The Brief

**Goal**: Purchase and legally own/drive a car in North America for long-term trips (\~3 months), avoiding large fees for rental cars.

**Why is this not easy?**:  Almost all US states require (in order of difficulty to obtain) either  US citizenship, a state driver's license, or proof of state residency to  register a car.  Even this last item can be difficult to obtain if you  are only holidaying in the US - the easiest-to-fulfill request for proof  of residency will be for a utility bill that has your name and address  on it, which you most likely won't be able to get from your rented  accommodation.

**In short, what is the solution?**:  Buy and register the car in Quebec, Canada! This Canadian province has  very relaxed rules surrounding buying/registering cars, and with a car  that is road-legal in Quebec - and therefore in Canada - you will be  able to drive unrestricted in the US.

I  will outline in detail the steps I went through below.  Quebec is  likely not many people's ideal starting point for a North American road  trip (although Montréal is very easy and cheap to get to from London  Heathrow, so maybe it should be!) so it should be noted that *I believe this may also be possible in some US states in the region*, in particular Vermont and Maine.  Perhaps in the comments, people can fill in the gaps here.

Purchasing and registering a car in Quebec

**1)** Purchase your car.  This is the easiest part, save all the usual stresses involved with purchasing a used car.  I used [Auto123 Quebec](https://www.auto123.com/en/used-cars/all-inventories/quebec/all-cities/all-years/all-makes/all-models/all-bodytypes/all-sellers/)  to find my car.  When budgeting, don't forget to add the federal sales  tax (GST, 5%) and the provincial sales tax (QST, 9.975%) to the tag  price.

Note that the sort of  person you'll be buying from will likely be a Francophone and speak  heavily-accented French that is not much like the French you are pretty  good at speaking to French people in France.  That said, if you're in  the Montréal area, people rarely have a problem with a conversation  being conducted in English.  But remember that these peoples' mother  tongue is French, so give them a break!

British  people: Note that at this stage the car will not have license plates.   You'll be given those later - that's how they do things here.

**2)** You've found a car you want to buy - great!  **Make sure during the purchase you get from the dealer the** ***Attestation de transaction avec un commerçant***  (proof of transaction with dealer).  A reputable dealer will give you  this without you having to ask, so if it does not appear then you should  be concerned.  They should also issue you with a temporary registration  certificate, which is essentially a paper license plate that is valid  for ten days from the day of purchase.  Stick it on the rear window of  your car facing out, and you are legal to drive around for that amount  of time.

**3)** The Quebec DMV - or DVLA for UK readers - is called the **SAAQ**.   To register your car, you need only four things.  (1) Your  (non-Canadian) driver's license, (2) a second proof of identity e.g.  your passport, (3) The *Attestation de transaction avec un commerçant*, and (4) a Canadian address.  **The Canadian address does not need to be permanent**,  and there is no need for you to be able to receive mail at the address.   They did not ask me for any proof that I lived at this address; I  could have given them literally any address in Quebec and achieved the  same result.

**4)** There are many SAAQ offices all over Quebec - go to [this website](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/find-service-outlet) to find your closest and also to book an appointment.

**5)**  Get to the SAAQ, wait in line, and when you are called to a particular  desk, say that you want to 'matriculer un auto' and hand over the three  documents mentioned above.  **At the time of writing, you 100% only need those three documents plus your Canadian address**,  so if you are told otherwise then question it, possibly even asking to  speak to a supervisor.  I had issues because the person serving me  demanded proof of legal status in Canada, which as a British tourist I  did not have (we are part of the visa waiver system).  I asked her to  get her supervisor who confirmed that all I needed were those three  documents - I did not even need to prove that I had successfully applied  for the visa waiver.

You seem to  pay the QST tax at this step, along with a service fee plus a Quebec  insurance premium. (These last two items come to about $100 total).   Note that even though you are now part of a mysterious Quebec insurance  scheme, you also need ordinary car insurance (see next step).  I do not  know why this is the case.

You'll  be issued with a license plate there and then, which is very strange for  a British person.  Note that attaching the plate to the car can be a  bit of a faff.  In fact, for me, due to rusted bolt holes and my  failures converting inches into milimetres, I'd go as far as to say this  was the most difficult part of the entire process.

**6)** Get insurance.  An important tip here is **not to tell the insurance company you want insurance for less than a year**.   If you do this, they will suspect you are doing something like  precisely what you are doing and charge you a higher premium.  Take  insurance for a year, but make sure to pay monthly; you have the right  to cancel car insurance in Canada without having to 'buy out' the rest  of the term, so you will lose at most one month's premium.  I used [lowestrates.ca](https://lowestrates.ca/) to find my insurer (note it may require a follow up phone call to complete, but this will be with an Anglophone Canadian).

**7)**  Drive over the border into the US and begin your trip!  Every single  thing I have read about Canadians driving in the US is that you can do  it without restriction so long as your car is road-legal in Canada.  If  this is wrong, commenters please correct me!

I've already planned for the drive to Sacramento to be along Highway 1, however am having trouble charting the trip back down to LA. Initially I thought to just take the I5 which I read was the fastest route, however there doesn't seem to be much to see  or do along the drive :/ Also considered taking the 99 and stopping in Visalia, and maybe spend a day in Sequoia. Plan C was to drive to Tahoe and take Highway 395, but that would significantly prolong the drive. I was hoping to take 2-3 days to drive from Sacramento to LA, and was kind of concerned that taking the 395 would be a bit rushed. So am turning to reddit to seek some advice for this :"")

roadtrip,"**1.** **Price**

For many consumers, price is the first consideration, especially for those who are financially strapped. Therefore, it is vital to control the budget. If you find a backpack you want, but unfortunately its price is beyond your budget, please remember to shop around and compare the price and you will always find one that is most worth buying in all aspects.

**2.** **Style**

I believe few people don’t check if their clothes or hairdo are OK in front of a mirror before going out. That’s because a person’s outfit can tell others his/her taste in fashion and whether he/she is sloppy, which is affects others’ first impression of themselves. Bags as our one of the important accessories in daily life, we should also choose carefully to conform to our fashion style.

**3.** **Material**

If you plan to buy a new backpack work bag for camping, mountain climbing, or short-term travel, you’d better buy one which is made of top waterproof and scratch-resistant canvas fabric because you don’t always find a perfect place to put your backpack (generally, it can only be placed on stones or lawns). So, buy a good backpack and don’t make it “scarred” anymore.

roadtrip,"I’m planning a 7 day national park van trip around Utah with the goal of seeing as much as possible. The problem is I don’t want to rush too much and the itinerary I made that hits all the big 5 works out to 8 days, so I’m thinking I’ll have to eliminate one. So my question is, out of Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon and Zion, which one should go? Keep in mind I’m only planning on spending one day in each, so ease of access to the best spots is a factor. Shorter hikes (&lt;5 miles) with high concentrations of stunning views is primarily what I’m looking for.

Day 2:
Arches NP, stay the night in Moab

Day 3:
Canyonlands NP, Dead horse point state park (if time), stay the night in Moab

Day 4:

Day 6:
Zion, stay the night in Zion

Day 7:

I'm planning on doing a \~3 weeks trip in Oregon, starting from Seattle and was looking into rentals.

In 2019 I had rented a van from escape campervans but for a single person it seems a bit overkill. This time I'm considering either renting a car and bringing my camping gear or trying to rent a smaller camper.

roadtrip,"We are hoping to do a bit more traveling this year which would more than likely start off as weekend road trips when our schedule permits and I'm looking for some additional opinions on cargo carriers.

Current vehicle is a 2006 Outback LL Bean edition (already has roof rails and cross bars), and the attendees would be myself, my spouse, our daughter, and two larger dogs. The main reason we're looking at roof storage is for a place to hold our folding dog crates, and I'm leery of strapping them directly to the cross bars and having them shift and come through the moonroof.

What I've looked at and thoughts so far...

\- Cargo bags - seems to be the most cost-effective, though durability can be hit or miss. Can easily be removed and stored when not in use. Wish they had a rigid bottom so they could lay on the cross bars, but will more than likely still have to lay it directly on the moonroof which I'm not entirely in to. 

\- Baskets - holds the cargo above/off of the moonroof which is nice. Seems like they can't be removed as easily as a cargo bag which may get annoying (and certainly isn't as compact when storing), but should be able to still drive with it on without taking too much of a fuel economy hit. No protection from the elements but can be used with a cargo bag if needed. 

\- Cargo Boxes - definitely the most versatile and offers the most protection, thoughthe most costly and the largest to store when not in use. It also seems like overkill for what we're looking for at this time.  May get one eventually if we travel enough (or find one cheap enough), but not an option I'm really exploring.

\- Hitch Cargo Carrier - Not a roof carrier, but an option I'm exploring. Easy to install/remove and not super expensive, and my car does have the towing option. Since I'm currently planning on using it for only a few bulky but lighter-weight items, this may not be too bad. The main downside is it will add length to the car which could make things dicey when parking.

So, who uses cargo carriers? Is there anything I should be considering that I missed?

After a few nights in Zion, I’ll be driving towards Page to get to the Grand Canyon. Thinking about not trying to do that all in one day so I want to camp in Kanab for 2 nights and Page for 2 as well.

Both of these spots are paved until they turn into dirt or sand roads. For Page, AZ, I’d pre-reserve and sleep at Page Lake Powell Campground. Then make my way over to the Canyon.

I’m aware that when it rains, dirt roads are not passable. So, long shot, have any Prius drivers camped to either of those 2 places recently? Did you have trouble driving in/out? Also what’s the likelihood you were able to snag a campsite if it’s first come first serve? I don’t wanna be *that* camper who gets pulled out of the sand but I also want to enjoy the campgrounds.

roadtrip," 

Dealing with a flat tire can be very inconvenient and even dangerous,  particularly when it happens while you are driving along busy roads.  These are just some of the reasons why the tire pressure monitoring  system (TPMS) has been lauded as an important safety technology.

When you have an underinflated tire, the TPMS light  turns on to alert you about it. The timely warning enables you to  address the issue before it becomes a nuisance and safety hazard.

The TPMS is indeed an invaluable car feature, and you recognise how  valuable it is. Perhaps there have been several occasions when it helped  you avoid having a flat tire while on the road or eliminated the need  to check your tires’ air pressure level manually.

But you also know that this technology is not perfect. You probably  experienced it malfunctioning, causing unnecessary hassle. Like most  vehicle owners, this situation made you think of permanently turning off  the warning light.

## What You Need to Know About Your TPMS Light 

As mentioned earlier, the TPMS light illuminates when there is an  issue with the air pressure in one or more of your tires. This can  either be a case of an underinflated or overinflated tire.

**The light stays on until the issue is resolved.** This means you need to remove or add air from the tire in question.

**The thing is that the TPMS warning light may illuminate even  if the air pressure in your tires meets the manufacturer’s recommended  level.** This can be attributed to the system getting inaccurate readings due to certain issues.

One of the most common reasons is failure to do a TPMS relearn after  changing or replacing tires. The relearn process is necessary to ensure  that the sensors and the system work.   

Skipping this step results in the system failing to detect or get the  information from the right sensor. For example, the system is getting  information from the replaced flat tire. This is why your TPMS light  turns on, even if there is no real issue with your tires.

The false warning can also result from a damaged sensor or a failing  sensor battery. It can also be due to the cold weather wherein tires’  air pressure naturally drops but goes back to normal after driving for a  few minutes.

While these TPMS-related issues are solvable, they can be  inconvenient and annoying since, as a responsible driver, you would have  to check your tires. **They can also be dangerous since the light can be distracting even for experienced drivers.**

Plus:

Not everyone has the time and money to address TPMS-related issues immediately.

But not resolving the problem means seeing the warning light on  whenever they are behind the wheel. So, vehicle owners find ways to turn  off their TPMS light to avoid getting distracted and stop dealing with  these issues repeatedly.

## Is It Possible to Turn Off Your TPMS Light Off Permanently?

One of the solutions to “turn off” the TPMS light is to cover it with  black tape. It is a crude method but preferred by many as it does not  require tinkering with the vehicle’s wires or ECU.

If you are looking for an easy way to deal with pesky TPMS light  issues, know that sticking a tape on your dashboard isn’t your only  option. You can use a TPMS bypass emulator to “turn off” your tire pressure monitoring system and not be bothered by the warning light.

The emulator is designed to be non-invasive, which means that you  don’t have to manipulate your car’s wirings or make changes to its ECU.  It is easy to use –turn it on and put it in your vehicle. You don’t even  need a mechanic or a professional to make it work.

**One great thing about the TPMS bypass emulator is that it can  “permanently” turn off your TPMS without altering anything in your  vehicle.** If you want to continue using it, it just has to stay on (and inside your vehicle).

Suffice to say, this device won’t make changes that can affect the  performance or safety of your vehicle. Moreover, if you want to use your  TPMS again, you can still do so, and all you have to do is turn off the  emulator.

roadtrip,"Hi friends!

I'm looking to take a road trip in the hopes of seeing more of the US and hopefully falling in love with a great place to live.  I am done with northern winters and ready for my next adventure. My idea is to plan a road trip from NY to FL down the east coast and hit up a bunch of places of interest along the way, but I'm open to visiting other places too. I gather LA and San Diego are too expensive for me but am curious about other parts of CA.  In general, here is what matters to me:


-WARM - nothing is too hot.  No winter. 🌞

-Scorpions are a dealbreaker 🚫🦂

-Access to nature 🏞️

-Vegan-friendly 🌱

-LGBTQ-friendly 🌈

-Dog-friendly 🐶

-Art/culture: live music, art scene 🎨🎸

-Rent under $2k/month for a 1-2 bedroom💰

-Close to water or within 2 hours' drive 🏖️

-Preferably east coast but open ➡️🤷‍♀️


I enjoy peace and quiet and don't mind small towns or driving a bit to get to all the action if that helps keep costs down, just not so rural that I can't, say, get a meal or groceries delivered.

-Taking trial classes at different gyms/exercise centers lol. I feel a little bad doing it when I don't plan to stay there but no one has to know I guess.

roadtrip,"Hi - My fiancée and I are looking to do a little adventure as part of our honeymoon. We have a week and were thinking about flying into Denver and doing a road trip to Vegas. I've never been to either city, but when I was in Salt Lake City a few years ago I really enjoyed it but wanted badly to see the southern Utah National Parks. With work ideally the first week of October would be when we go.

Our philosophy with road trips is **'we don't need to see it all and don't want to feel rushed'.** We rather just go to the 2-3 best spots and come back another time, than try to go to a new spot or even 2 places in a single day. We are the same way about visiting cities, we tend to love everyplace we visit so we often go back and do the things we skipped the first time.

We don't mind hiking but we have no camping gear or experience  so we would need normal lodging but we are also open to more 'fun rustic' (as long as running water/shower/toilet is included) so any fun ideas where to stay like that (think a cozy tiny cabin).

We have no interest in Denver so we thought:

Day 1: Hit the road to Stop #1

Day 2 - 6: Not Sure, but Grand Canyon seems like a must since we have never been

roadtrip,"The plan is to take a relaxed trip to NYC, stopping at places we see fit on the way. Once at NYC, we're gonna drive straight to LA while taking as few stops as possible.

Driving and sleep rotations. I suggested 6 hour driving shifts with a stretch/bathroom break every 3 to keep the driver awake. We'd stop and get real sleep if there comes a time when we both feel too tiered to drive.

Food. I was thinking a cooler with drinks and stuff for sandwiches with some snacks. I don't want to get fast food more than 1x per day. We'd stop at a Walmart or something similar to refill food and ice as seen fit.

roadtrip,"Hello, 

Lightly planning a trip to Canada in early June and need to work out a route - we’ll be arriving at/leaving from Vancouver so the route must be a loop from there. Just over two weeks, two relatively fit and healthy adults. 

So far we’ve identified that we absolutely must go over to Banff (inc Lake Louise, Moraine Lake etc) type region as there are hikes/activities we’d like to do out there. Unsure about Calgary, on a trip in a different country we cut the nature part short to go to a city and immediately regretted it, don’t want to do that again. We’d somehow like to incorporate Penticton and Harrison Hot Springs into the route too. 

We’d like to incorporate some sort of kayaking/canoeing trip, ideally one which has some sort of “indigenous” experience so isn’t just a quick paddle along the coast and back, if anyone has any suggestions of companies that offer this? 

We’ve already done Whistler and Vancouver Island on a previous trip so not too bothered about them. 

So if anyone has any suggestions for the below: 
- Must sees between Vancouver/Banff 
- suggested routes to/from Banff (ideally we’d like to do different routes there and back) 
- “Indigenous” outdoor experiences

Me  and my wife are planning to get our two daughters to a holiday trip in  Italy. We have never been to Italy. We don't want to choose the most  popular places, we don't want to go to hotel with all inclusive  standard. We decided to drive RV and live in it while visitng the  beautiful country. The visiting isn't to be usual all-churches-checking.  There are three most important things we would like to experience:  food, landscapes and of course people. This is why we would like to use  RV and avoid big cities. Instead we are planning to go to small towns or  even villages and tripping from one to another to see some regional  festivals of food and wine.

Is  there any trustworthy website/blog or maybe governal institute in Italy  that would give us the information about where and when are local  festivals organized?

What region is most proper destination for our plans?

Do poeple speak english there?

Additionaly what are the COVID restrictions nowadays and what's most important, are they obeyed in villages/small towns?

Mon: Death Valley
Tues-Wed: Death Valley? Las Vegas? Joshua Tree?
Thurs: Joshua Tree (camp site reserved)
Fri: Joshua Tree/LA
Sat: LA
Sun: drive LA —&gt; SF Bay Area via Pacific Coast Highway

Question: For Tues/Wed, I’m debating between
* stay/camp in Death Valley on Tues &amp; do Vegas just on Wed
* head to Vegas on Tues afternoon, do Vegas Tues evening + Wed
* skip Vegas, go to Joshua Tree Tues or Wed (problem: no reserved camp site on Tues/Wed)
* (skip Vegas, go to Grand Canyon on Tues or Wed???) &lt;— leaning against this… inlaws just retired to AZ so might just make a separate Grand Canyon trip

I guess the question depends largely on how much time is worth spending in Death Valley… I’m a decent hiker but NOT an experienced camper, so I’m leaning towards going to Vegas in between Death Valley and Joshua Tree. But advice would be much appreciated!!!

Also, is all of this doable in a Honda Civic? Based on some googling it seems fine (car has been checked up recently), but wanted to double check.

* I have a national park pass &amp; basic camping equipment (tent, sleeping pad+bag).
* I can comfortably drive 5-6hrs in one sitting. I also actually enjoy driving so don’t mind if the trip becomes a tad too drive-heavy.

My plan is to fly into Houston Texas and leave via Seattle after hitting as many new states in between as possible. What I adored most from my earlier roadtrips in the US was the nature &amp; mountains so I'm excited to finally hit those states up North with the beautiful mountains.

As I have zero experience with these new states, any tips for certain cities/spots are much appreciated, I've also added a rough route below with some questions where needed. **This is still just a rough guide just to have a general clue what route/states to take or to avoid, no days planned yet.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1) Houston to Dallas &amp; further up North (red)**

Is it best to just keep the trip in a straight line between houston &amp; dallas and stop at spots in between or will I be missing out on better things more to the West in Texas?

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2) Continue North to Salt Lake City Utah (Green &amp; Blue)**

I can either do this via Albuquerque and Denver checking off New Mexico, Colorado &amp; part of Wyoming or would it be better to first go West via New Mexico, Arizona and then up to Utah?

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3) Yellowstone National Park (Pink)**

Once in Idaho, I want to hit Yellowstone for sure! And then I'm guessing the best option is to drive back West towards Oregan instead of hitting Seattle via Montana, right?

Finally I want to spend some time in both Oregon and Washington hitting national parks and several specific mountains.

roadtrip,"Im in the process of planning 2.5 week fall trip in October to southern Utah from Texas.  We’ve previously been to Moab to see Canyonlands and Arches National Parks a few years ago.  We will be in a truck camper and plan to do some dry camping/national forest camping and will also have a separate four wheel drive vehicle with us if there are any high clearance roads we shouldn’t miss out on.

I do not know much about the area and I’m not sure if I allocated too many days to Capitol Reef and if it is worth staying in Torrey to get laundry done one day after being so close in Capitol Reef or should we move somewhere else down Highway 12.  I saw Kodachrome State Park may have laundry facilities further down Hwy 12 we could stop at.  Is grand staircase national monument worth exploring for two days or should we move on?  Here’s what I have so far:

1 Texas to Albuquerque 1 night
2 Monument Valley Mexican Hat area
3 Monument Valley Mexican Hat area
4 Capitol Reef
5 Capitol Reef
6 Capitol Reef 
7 Capitol Reef to Torrey for 1 night?
8 To Grand Staircase National Monument

On July 15 we will arrive in Tucson around 11 pm. We have an Airbnb for July 15-17, and on July 16 we plan to visit Saguaro National Park.

On July 17 we will drive from Tucson to Sedona, where we will stay at a hotel until July 19. We want to do some hiking and shopping here, and I want to experience the vortexes I have read about as well.

The morning of July 19 we will drive to Flagstaff where we have an Airbnb until July 22. We plan to visit the Grand Canyon while in Flagstaff and do some hiking. Since we have almost 3 days here we thought about taking a day and driving to the Hoover Dam and possibly further on to Vegas.

On our way home on July 22 we will stop at Petrified Forest National Park.

Back story about us - we love to hike and be outdoors, and we are trying to visit all the National Parks. We LOVE roadtrips. We are foodies and love trying new foods, especially ones that are unique to the area we are at.

Also - I am very aware that July weather in Arizona is hot and dangerous. We are from MS so we understand hot and humid weather, but I know AZ summers are a different ballgame than we are used to.

roadtrip,"Hi Guys!

I want to take a road trip to Utah next month for about a week. This is my plan so far:

Day 1: Fly to Las Vegas, get rental, drive to Antelope Canyon (try to book a tour asap), drive to Monument Valley for sunset. Either stay nearby here or drive to Moab at night (not sure about this)

Day 2: Stay in Moab for two days to check out: Arches, Canyonlands, Dead Horse

Day 4: Drive to Capitol Reef, Take Highway 12 down to Bryce Canyon

Day 5: Drive to Zion (stay two days) 

Day 7: Back to Vegas for evening flight

Is this too ambitious? I know gas prices are high now and I need to book things fast. Should I eliminate Capitol Reef and Antelope Canyon? 

Also, can you sleep in your car anywhere safe? I feel like I could use a couple hours of sleep near Monument Valley and then drive to Moab early morning and don't need a room.

 I don't plan on doing Angel's Landing since you need a permit and I don't care for heights, but I do want to do the Narrows. Things I really want to see are Monument Valley, the Arches, Antelope Canyon, Bryce Park, Drive Highway 12.

roadtrip,"Hi all,

I'm in the early innings of planning a road trip for mid-May with my wife. I have a couple ideas, but hoping to round those out further with any recommendations I may find here. I'm looking to fly into either Denver or Phoenix from Arkansas, rent a car at the airport, and then use the unlimited miles to drive around one of these two paths (or a totally different path) for something like 7-8-9 days. I was originally thinking of flying to Denver and road-tripping all the way to Las Vegas to finish the trip out, but the cost of dropping a rental car at a different location is just absurd (I get that it presents a logistical challenge for the car rental company to have cars shifting all over or for them to get the car back to Denver, but I'm looking at national brands like Avis/Hertz/Enterprise so I really imagine they have the footprint to be able to do this - oh well). 

As I can't do the above, I started thinking of two separate ideas where I either fly into Denver or into Phoenix, do a big circular road trip, eventually getting the car back to the airport I picked it up at and just flying back out of there.

I'll throw a crude picture in here that illustrates the two different pathways I've got so far. The locations of each show on the left hand side. I would love any recommendations or ideas on places to hit rather than what I've got, in addition to what I've got, attractions/food/hiking along the way, different road trip ideas West of Denver, etc. If anyone asks, I'd be happy to throw a little starter itinerary I've got going that breaks out the days, driving times, etc.

Thank you everyone in advance!

I’m planning a 4 month road trip through Alberta, BC, the Yukon, and Alaska this summer/fall. Will be going solo with my two dogs in my mid size SUV and doing the majority of it car camping- have the back converted into a mini camper type thing. 

I have a 35 Yeti tundra cooler and the longest road trip I’ve done with it was 3 and a half weeks. Worked pretty good for me, lots of gas station stops anyway and buying ice every 5/6 days wasn’t too much of an annoyance. The only thing I’m worried about is wanting to stay camped in one spot somewhere for a week or so and being outta luck because of melted ice. Don’t think that there’s really a way around this tho with a cooler!

I’m wondering for a longer trip, has anyone done two coolers? I was thinking of getting another 35 tundra or maybe a little 20/24 quart. Also had thought of getting a 45 tundra and taking that and the 35…. But that’s eating up a lot of space in my car. Was thinking for one to be extra jammed with ice and have frozen meat/more cold food, and the other for drinks/veg/cheese/etc. 

Anyone have any grand cooler advice for the longer trips? Any advice or recommendations would be very appreciated! Thank you!

* National Parks
* Nature/Beach
* City tourism
* 1 Shopping Outlet


We would love to see SF, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite, US1 north to south down to at least LA. We have been in LA before. We started our midwest tour from there the last time. 

Questions:

* How long to stay in SF/Lake Tahoe/Yosemite? Are two nights each ok? 
* Where to stop on US1? How much to plan for that trip down to LA? 
* Have a base in LA as I have enough hotel reward points for 5 nights and then visit from there Joshua Tree or fly to somewhere else for a few days like Hawaii or any other suggestion? 

We have three weeks for this trip and are ok with spending money as long as it is useful/unique/worth it. But would rather not waste it on stuff nobody needs. Also willing to do detours if you say it is worth it.

roadtrip,"Hi, lately I have been looking into the idea of buying a teardrop camper. I am a 28F, I grew up camping in a tent with family and although it has been quite some time I do recall enjoying camping. I don't have a S/O and my work schedule doesn't line up with friends that great, unfortunately. I have been wanting to get into camping again and would like to travel a bit as well; so I thought maybe a teardrop would be best for being solo and to do road trips to travel North America (I'm in Ontario, Canada). My job also allows for lots of time off. 

I initially thought about SUV vehicle camping but as I looked into it I felt that maybe that would be a bit of a hassle having to put in and remove the build to make that comfortable and I liked the idea of the teardrop being already set up as I travel. 

I have a Rav4 for a vehicle and a kayak that I thought would be a good thing to take along with me.

So my questions. Would a teardrop be my best option for this idea? Has anyone in this group done any solo trips like that? Did you enjoy it or does it get lonely? What do you do when solo in the evening to not get bored or on rainy days? Should I be concerned someone would steal the kayak if I am doing road-tripping and not just camping and staying put?",Looking for advice - Thinking of buying a Teardrop Trailer and doing road trips.,1644952903

i dont need to visit Banff NP, Yoho NP, Kootney NP, or Revelstoke NP as i have been to them already on other roadtrips.

according to google maps the trip should be 9826km, but i think will more likely be around 12-13,000km when i take into account driving around town and the national parks, getting to and from campsites, and other unexpected detours.

time not spent on the ferry is 53 days, taking a full 20 days out for full day activities where none or very little travelling will be done makes the average driving distance approx 379km/travel day. id like to keep my driving to around 4-5hrs per day as longer driving stretches seem to just drag the whole trip down. Id rather take longer and see/do more than drive past many interesting things i wont be near again.

One of the stops I want to make is Death Valley NP. I will have two days to explore there.

Most of the places I am planning to visit are in the same area(Zabriskie Point, Artists Palette, Mesquite Flat Dunes, Badwater Basin, Dante's View). I'm coming from Sequoia NP.

What would be a convenient and not that expensive(e.g. Oasis at Death Valley is too expensive) staying area?

I'm also trying to find a place that is not too far from Death Valley as I'm planning to catch Sunset and Sunrise during those two days.

roadtrip,"Hey all,

Sorry for the long post... 

Planning on making a move/road trip from Miami to LA. Just wanted to pick some brains here. I would be doing this trip with a cousin and my dog...

Moving to California from Florida for a job and they're giving me relocation money. What I don't use, I get to keep which is nice.

Being that I haven't done this drive since I was a kid, I really don't know what I'm getting myself into. But I would love to add some stops so there's SOME fun, my cousin is from Colombia and this will be new for both of us.

**First the business of moving...** 

What you think is the best out of these options? (priced without gas being accounted).

1. Get a ubox, fill it up and wait like 3-4 weeks for it to get to California ($1700), then drive my 2015 Camry with 90k to California.

2. Rent a U-Haul and a towing dolly for the car and drive to California and that will be $2400

*****Pros for 1****: I can drive faster, not use as much gas, and not have to worry about towing a vehicle along with all my stuff.

**Cons for 1**: More wear and tear for my poor Camry. I won't get the majority of my stuff for a whole month. 

**Pros for 2**: I'll always have my stuff with me. Only tires would be used on the tow dolly. Immediately have my stuff with me.

**Cons for 2**: Never have driven with a car in tow. With a truck full of stuff and a car, I'm sure the drive would probably be extended by a lot. One thing is traveling in a small car where I'm nimble enough to drive faster, another is being stuck on the road and not being able to enjoy some of the trip*

**For the road trip portion**

Any suggestions on what I should consider on this road trip? Some of the things I'd like to do would be.

1. Stopping in Orlando for the evening, I have VERY close friends of mine and it would be amazing to be able to have a farewell to Florida night with them.

2. I have family in Houston

3. Would love to take a detour to see the grand canyon.

4. once I'm in Tucson, should I go straight to LA, or should I go to San Diego and THEN LA?

I'm planning on taking my camera and drone along the way to capture some cool footage as well so any locations I should consider along the way?",Moving/Road Trip Ideas and Questions - Miami to Los Angeles,1644385273

H = full day hike

* Red rock Canyon
* Death Valley
* Sequoia (H)
* Yosemite (H)

The car currently runs pretty smooth with a few weird noises sitting pretty at 113k miles.

This is the second time the car has done a long trip like this since last summer 2021, from Florida, I drove to Utah using mostly dirt back-roads, then north towards montana, west towards Washington state, then south through Santa Cruz before going straight back to Florida. Never directly drove to any specific place and kind of snaked around checking out hikes and other spots.

5 weeks in total and the only thing that happened to the car was a popped a tire.

I'm not sure if that was just first time luck, so I want to make sure it'll be able to handle something like that again.

Battery

Brakes

Tanny Fluid

 Possibly clutch

I'm pretty sure I have more then enough money saved up for this but I'd actually like to to be able to pay for it by working town to town across different states.

I obviously have next to no experience in this sorta thing so forgive my ignorance, but I mean like is it possible to stop in a town, rent a motel and ask around if anyone could use a worker for like a few days or a week. I'd prefer to actually get paid and not just get paid in food and housing which I'm fine with providing myself.

My wife a friend and I are currently planning a road trip.to the USA. We all live in Europe and would like to experience the food, the historical aspects and the scenery of the south. We need some help planning though.

We were thinking of flying to New Orleans and going in a circle. Something like New Orleans, Austin/Houston, Memphis/Nashville, Savannah, Orlando, New Orleans. We were hoping to save money by returning to the same spot. Since this is the first road trip for all of us we have a couple of questions:

1. Is this doable in 20 days? According to Google maps, the whole thing takes like 41h. That's an average of 2h/day considering that we want to be able to stay in some places a couple of days i think we'll be driving for approx 6h/driving day.

1a. Do you think we could even go to key west Florida? I feel like the road trip didn't involve too much driving yet and that the keys would be a nice addition. But i don't want to overdo it.

2. Do you think we picked interesting places? We're not too interested in going out much, but we are looking for museums, good ""soul food"" and scenic walks and drives.

3. Our friend won't be 21 yet. Do you think this will be an issue? None of us are drinkers really, but we heared that he might not be allowed into certain places even if he has no intention of drinking.

4. Should we buy a van, rent a car from a company or use a car sharing site? We're trying to save money where we can. It's returning to New Orleans even necessary?

5. Is AirBnb still a good option during these pandemic times? We're planning on going in 2023 but still.

1. I'd like to be in the actual DESERT and beautiful landscapes, avoiding the highways and big roads with nothing to see. Are there apps or maps I can find that will help navigate a trip from those two destinations while avoiding the major roadways whenever possible?
2. Is there any famous routes in that area? I just did the Appalachian trail and learned there are wonderful little travel cultures EVERYWHERE I'm completely ignorant to. If there was a beloved route people love to travel, I'd really like to join it!
3. How much do yall spend on average per day on a trip? I already told my buddy I am completely okay with camping on the side of the road and eating camp-food, but I'm curious what other people's expenses are like. Again, my AT trip taught me there are a lot of hidden expenses you dont expect!
4. What are the best spots in the southwest that would be easy/worth driving through? I've only been to L.A., and dont know much about our dry little desert!

roadtrip,"Taking a road trip from TX to Santa Cruz, CA area in the Spring. 

We can take around two weeks and we are looking to keep the driving down to 5 - 7 hours per day if possible. We'll be a couple of people, a dog, and a small travel trailer and we can spend a couple days at different stops to break the trip up, probably staying at a mix of AirBnB, hotels, or camping depending on the area. 

Looking for recommendations on any comfortable/safe/interesting towns or places to stay along the way. Or changes you would make to the route so we don't miss anything major. Lots of NPs on the route, but that's unfortunately hard to fully enjoy with the dog with us.

We've done a similar trip before across the bottom of the US on the I-10 to I-8 route and are thinking about heading farther North and driving over via I-40 this time. The I-10/I-8 route is faster, but pretty boring once you've done it once.

A relatively cheap snowmobile trip or photography trip focused on animals would be amazing, but I’ll take any suggestions as to good tours if you have any.

I have all the gear for winter hikes, so any dope trail suggestions are welcome.

roadtrip,"Hi all. I have done this trip and back several times, but I always go through MI, OH, KY, TN, AL. Now I want to stop off in Savannah, GA to see family. I have 2 options for this going through Niagara/Buffalo. My main concern is Winter weather conditions and the mountains. I HATE driving through mountains and the elevation changes scare the hell out of my dogs. Need the lowest elevation possible. I have an AWD vehicle with winter tires. 

1) First route takes me through Pittsburgh; WV (I would stop in Charleston WV for a night bc I travel with 3 big dogs and we make LOOOOOTS of stops); through Charlotte, NC; Columbia, SC. The interstates involved are the 79, 77 and the 26. Total trip is about 19 hours. I have driven this before in summer and the mountains scared the hell out of me. 

2) Other option is through small town PA on smaller, non-interstate roads, eventually getting on interstate 80 to (eventually) interstate 70 into MD;  then I-81 to VA, to I-73 in NC, to 95 in SC. On this trip I would need to stop somewhere in Maryland. Total trip is 21 hours. 

Which route is the safest weather wise? What are the elevation issues. I reviewed a topographical map, but it is difficult (impossible really) to tell how the roads are through these mountains. 

I am open to any suggestions and curious about issues I may have not considered for these routes.

I am trying to get some advice for a small roadtrip I have coming up. I am flying from Florida to LA where I will be renting a car. I am planning on heading with my family from Los Angeles to Three River's California. We were hoping to see if we could make it into sequoia national park but I am reading that there could be ice on the road and / or snow from Three River's into Sequoia. 

I wanted to know if anyone has any advice on the travel from Los Angeles to Three rivers (Where we will be staying in a cabin for 3 nights.) I have driven in winter/winter storm weather a handful of times in my life. However, as my wife is pregnant and I will have my young child with me, I am planning on completely avoiding any ice/snow driving condition especially at higher altitudes/inclines; I just don't have the risk tolerance for it these days. I also dont want to be white knuckling a steering wheel in a crazy icy incline. 

Should I have any problems getting into three river's from Los Angeles? Mainly concerned with elevation and or Ice and snow.

I would like to share with you a new experience and pleasure, brought by the simple use of a new and unique travel planning platform [www.CampTarget.com](http://www.camptarget.com/).

I have been driving my RV for years and I enjoy it. Sometimes my trips are shorter and sometimes they last longer, ranging from picnics to weekends, and even longer trips, regardless of the Season and actual weather. 

Along with the very traveling and discovering new destinations, the very preparations for the trip and route planning is an integral part and pleasure of the whole event, as well as the returning, unpacking, cleaning, and maintenance of the RV until the next trip.

The only thing that represented a bit of a problem for me (and all of you, I'm sure) was the plan/travel dynamics, appropriate assessment of the available time, hours, days.

However, when I discover the [www.CampTarget.com](http://www.camptarget.com/) platform, everything changed! The problem was sold and the travel experience became a full pleasure!

Traveling with the RV is slow and includes a lot of stops in a day. Out of my experience, and also other people's, the effective daily ride lasts about 4-5 hours. This is the very thing none of us has so far managed to estimate – where these 4-5 hours end.

Until the appearance of the [www.CampTarget.com](http://www.camptarget.com/) platform, we have tried to determine the route using all available tools, various route planners, however, it all remained on the estimation level and, mostly, wrong. The problem is not wrongly calculated distance or the stop point. The problem appears when we discover there is no parking available at the spot we have planned to use for that day, so we lose another hour or two looking for parking somewhere else.

It is all solved by the [www.CampTarget.com](http://www.camptarget.com/) platform. It is very simple and takes a few steps to plan your trip.

The Platform is designed to offer effortless planning. It notifies you if you have exceeded a planned daily-hourly allowance. It offers plenty of information and the possibility to connect to other websites without having to leave [www.CampTarget.com](http://www.camptarget.com/), and, also, there are no commercials to annoy or distract you.  

You can correct or alter your route until you define the one that suits you best. All planned routes remain in your box, and you can download them or share them with your friends any time you like.

Anyway, [www.CampTarget.com](http://www.camptarget.com/) is what every traveler needs, regardless of their being RV owner or a passenger in another type of vehicle. Even when you leave your RV at home and travel by plane to the other part of the world, where you may rent a car, [www.CampTarget.com](http://www.camptarget.com/) will perform its task excellently.

Hello, so we are 3 with the ages 22, 24, and 25 from Denmark planning a trip to the US for **may/June 4 week, 30 days apporixmately.** For most of us this is the first time to California, and first time going camping for real.

We have looked at different options as we first considered and RV,but think we will drop it due to us spending a lot of days in the bigger cities. And also we have no experience driving, them and I have read that they can be a hassle to deal with. We are atm considering driving with a camper van from escape campervan (maverick or Big Sur) models. So far I have come up with this route with inspiration from others.

Day 1-4 arrive in LA **3 Nights** in LA, Griffith observatory, Getty center, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach

Day 4-6 (Fetch our rental car/Campervan/RV) Drive to San Diego, **2-night stay**. San Diego zoo, 

Day 6 Drive to LV via 215/15, or a detour through Joshua Tree National park

Day 7/8-10 **2 Night stay at LV**, Red Rock canyon, and the strip, Bellagio Spring

Day 10-13 Drive to Grand Canyon Village, small stop at the Hoover Dam, Camp at a campingsite

· Here we would like some advice on what to see, as it is our first time to GC, and camping sites.

Day 13 Drive to Horsebend shoe and antelope canyon 

Day 13-15/16 Drive to Zion nationalpark, Angels Landing/The Narrows Hike, and other trails

Day 16 Death Valley short stop, 

Day 17-19 arrive in Sequioa National Park

Day 19-21 Yosemite Nationalpark, Mariposa Grove, Tuolomne Meadows

1. So we are asking for advice about if this is a to tight timeline, and if we should drop some destinations like Lake Tahoe, and Sequioa National Park.

2. Advice for camping in the different national park with a campervan

3. Suggestions to must see attractions in the different places in places like West Coast at PCH1, Yosemite, Zion, GC

4. If we at the start of the journey should drop the campervan when staying in LA and San Diego, and instead using public transportation for the first 6 days, and instead go back to LA and get the campervan afterwards.

And if you have any other suggestions feel free to gives some advice.
