I had the ""Nicks Meaty Flank"" and it was delicious but a little filling. The vanilla milkshake is more like a thick shake which was a great surprise and it was one of the best I've had in Singapore. Very cold and so nice to have on a warm day. The service could have been a little quicker, it was no where near complaint worthy.Great breeze up here which made it a lovely temperature for a late lunch.Definite recommend."

It's a breezy relaxing place to enjoy a couple of drinks, snacks and the fantastic skyline view. The breeze can be felt more regularly at the end or beginning of the year, but a little less during the middle of the year most probably due to the change in monsoon seasons.Prices are reasonably affordable, unlike the dining establishments in the Jewel Box next to the cable car complex.Parking along Mount Faber Road may be a little limited if there's an event at the Jewel Box. Otherwise you can try the valet. Given limited public transport and parking options, taxi is recommended.Note: This place is not to be confused with ""Faber Hill Bistro"", a higher end restaurant that closed a few years ago."

It was located in a complex of a few restaurants and bars in a very nice area.  The servers were super attentive and helpful in recommendations.We ended up ordering a few dishes. If I remember correctly:~Candlenut Buah Keluak Fried Rice- actually super spicy (for me lol) but was one of my favorite side dishes.~Wok fried Tiger Prawns- Prawns were made well and in a tasty curry sauce~Wagyu Beef Rendang- also one of my favorites of the night.. such tender beef!!~Satay- covered in a sweet savory sauce, also recommended!Also if you want an drink that makes you feel like a total child: Milo dinosaur. It's like an advanced version of chocolate milk drink with grass jelly... only for the adventurous."

I particularly enjoyed the appetizers and the wing bean salad, as well as the kueh salat. However, I was disappointed with all other main course dishes. The tiger prawns, which I had looked forward to, were depressingly overcooked. I know that shrimp can be challenging not to overcook, but I expect a Michelin star restaurant to have this technique down.I shared with two members of the waitstaff about the overcooked shrimp and nothing was done to make up for this basic technique messup. Nothing was sent from the kitchen and nothing was removed from the bill. I didn't want to make a scene so I just paid (and left a 16% tip on top of the 10% service fee thinking I wasn't being generous only to find out that I probably should not have left any additional tip), but I am still somewhat in awe that a restaurant of such high recognition failed to do some of the most basic service industry things. Maybe I am spoiled from my previous Michelin experiences, but it just simply did not measure up to other 1 star places I've dined at.One thing I do recommend is the tea that I ordered that was called the Candlenut on the menu. I kind of wish I had asked if I could purchase this tea to bring back with me.Overall disappointing, because I really want to see more Asian chefs receive recognition for providing great dining experiences around the world, but Candlenut does not receive a recommendation from me."

We ordered the tasting menu and you can see a lot of effort is put in the presentation and I enjoyed the food. Maybe it's something I have to get used to, but what this was IMO was very traditional dishes that you usually think of as homey and comfortable, and they just swapped the ingredients to premium quality. There's just some mental block of homey comfort food should be cheap, simple, and delicious and in this case the comfort food was expensive, simple, and delicious. Sure it tasted better, but I'm not sure if it was worth the extra price tag. If price is no concern, this is a very enjoyable place. If it is, I'm not sold that it's entirely worth it.Some of my favorite items from the tasting menu were the lamb neck satay, deep fried octopus, blue swimmer crab curry (their speciality), baby squid in tamarind sauce.The lamb was really soft and felt fatty, but I don't think it was. The deep fried octopus had a bunch of seasoning with it and was just a really unique dish. The crab curry was kind of exactly how you would imagine it. Curry and crab (the crab was of such high quality though and it really stood out). The baby squid was masked with this really interesting sauce. It was spicy, very acidic, and sweet.All in all, it ended up being S$210"

Don't get me wrong, the place is nice. I didn't realize it would share a space with another restaurant (like there isn't a separating wall). But as I said earlier, we had spent the past couple of weeks in Asia (and this wasn't our first time in Singapore) so we were a little disappointed just because it didn't taste ""new"" to us. We had been to other places that had better rendang or curry. If we had come here at the beginning of our trip, we probably would have been impressed. We liked the start of the meal with the soup and appetizers but the family style mains were a meh.

My rating is based on the following:Food: 5 starsEnvironment: 4 starsService: 4.5 starsRecommendations: Wagyu beef rendangThe portion size is on the small side. I knew this before hand after reading some of the reviews and ordered two mains.  I came in hungry and easily finished a bowl of rice, the king tiger prawns, the beef rendang, and the buah keluak ice cream. 1 The wagyu beef rendang - This is the best beef rendang I have ever had. The meat was cut with a fork tender and was bursting with flavor. I highly recommend. 2King tiger prawns - The coconut sauce the prawns were served with was delicious. The prawns were cooked nicely and the shell was partially removed making it easy to eat. This dish only comes with two prawns though and feels more like a small plate than a main.  3 Buah keluak ice cream - The dish looks simple in appearance but there is a lot going in here. You have a mix of temperatures (warm chocolate vs ice cream), textures (cake crumbs vs ice cream and melted chocolate) , and tastes (sweet and spice).  I would like to come back again and try the tasting menu. I didn't get to try any of small plates, soups or roasted dishes.  You should definitely check this place out. It's not cheap but it's worth it."

I wanted to try this place as I never had Peranakan cuisine before and this place had good reviews and a micheline star. We went for the tasting menu aka. ahmakase menu (Candlenut's version of omakase). The restaurant is not located in a mall which is good as it offers something different then the mall based scenery of Orchard Street. Though it is in a restaurant complex with a few other restaurants around, that does not affect the overall experience. I had read some comments  about the seating being too stuffy but that was not my experience.The food was very good. I do not remember all the names of the foods we've tried but none of them disappointed. With each meal our hostess explained what we were eating. The desserts were amazing, service was great and all in all this was a really good dining experience. The service time is 2 hours but we went there at the last service so that wasn't an issue for us.

Out came a flurry of dishes, all tiny and exquisite.When it comes to Peranakan food, I'm used to sizable portions and strong flavors. Here it's a little more refined and didn't give me that satisfaction of endless amounts of food despite being satisfying overall. Shoutouts to the fish cracker starter that was airy and crunchy and delicious, the lamb satay which was mind blowingly tender and flavorful, the wing bean salad that was refreshing and crunchy, and the blue swimmer crab curry which was lemak and really good. I also liked my durian dessert though I guess if you have good durian you don't need to mess with it too much.For the price I paid, I wanted more food.

Whispers my dining companion through giggles.And that began what unbeknownst to me would be one of the best meals in Singapore.It just goes to show that you should not start off exploring a country's food with the most difficult to understand, and highly refined.Candlenut is a Michelin one star Peranaken restaurant in the heart of Dempsey. The food is uniquely Singaporean, the joining of Chinese and Malay food using the local ingredients.The dining space, part of a large warehouse, does not at all resemble a Michelin restaurant however, the food speaks for itself.Begin with a number of small plates. All dishes are meant to be shared. The kueh pie tee crispy shell stuffed with crab meat, seasoned with curry, and a bit of pickled shallots, almost taste of laksa.  The wing bean salad with baby radish, lemongrass, cashews in a calimansi lime dressing, the definition of texture. Extremely refreshing. Finally the crispy pork belly with pickled greens, outstanding. Think of the best Filipino lechon topped with crisp pickled veg, it's tight sour grip finishing with a gentle fermented seafood flavor. Excellent complexity.Mains crisscross the country. An excellent wagyu beef rendang, tender and extremely flavorful wrapped in a slury of cumin, turmeric, turmeric leaves, and other spices, wallops the pallet. The spice mix penetrates the meat all the way to its deep core. Not to be out done, a dish called ""Mum's Curry"" is equally deeply flavored. Tender, juicy chunks of chicken and potatoes and a deep rich curry mixture. Fresh peppers brighten the dish. Both are perfect spooned over some rice.The dish of the evening, red lion snapper simply cooked in a fresh chili sambal with charred garlic chives; incredible. The sweet flavor of the fish is accented beautifully by the fiery sambal.  A squeeze of calamansi brightens the flavor. Desserts, are also outstanding. It is hard to fault the Kueh salat with bangkit crumble and young coconut sorbet.  Hawaii yeeps, think of the best custard mochi you've ever had, add a light, refreshing, coconut supercharged sorbet and you have this dish.Service is informal and very friendly. As with most South East Asian countries, you must flag the server if you want something.Nice selection of wine however there is no better match to the food than beer considering the spice levels.Reservations required.Impressive to say the least. Save this for your final meal in the country and it will all make sense.Thank you Singapore."

I booked it online about 1 month out when reservations opened, but it wasn't as full as I expected on a Saturday night. It's located on a hill in the Como Dempsey restaurant complex - pretty much only accessible by car (we used Grab). The complex itself is very pretty, and the restaurant shares its space with another one for their places.  The atmosphere is fairly casual - no real dress code. Complimentary: - Fish crackers and sweet soy sauce To start: - Kueh pie tee shell, Boston lobster, yeye curry, roasted candlenut: crisp thin pastry shell with lobster and galangal - Deep fried Fremantle octopus, pineapple and cucumber achar, roasted peanuts: the relish on top was nice - Bergedil, sambal ikan bilis: deep fried potato hash with anchovy sambal - Charcoal grilled snake river farm kurobota pork satay, kicap manis glaze: good sweet pork satay Soup: - Hee peow soup, fa gao, eel fish maw, chicken stuffed tofu puff, fried shallot, minced crab, fish broth - the broth was rich. I'm not a huge fan of fish maw, but it was an interesting soup Mains: a lot of small dishes served family style (slightly reminiscent of an Indonesian rice table)..- Westholme wagyu beef rib rendang, serunding, turmeric leaf: tons for flavor, great with rice. Even better with some kaffir lime- Babi buah keluak soft bone pork with black nut gravy: because of the cut of pork, some parts were quite fatty, some parts were more cartilage, but overall, flavor was good - Blue swimmer crab curry, turmeric, galangal, kaffir lime leaf: this was the star - tons of lump crab meat in a coconut curry, even better with a squeeze of lime - Crispy turmeric Tiger beer battered soft shell prawn: never had soft shell prawn before. It was quite big, served head on; eat while hot- Ikan chuan chuan, kuhlbarra ocean barramundi filet, fermented soybean, ginger sauce, fried ginger - Tauhu goreng, sayur manis and young jackfruit, peanut sauce, ginger flower: like tofu with peanut sauce (reminded me of Thai food)Additional dipping sauces: - Red chili sambal with crispy chicken skin: good with the beef and the curry - Tempeh, sambal hijau: good with rice Pre dessert: - Sweet mandarin orange tangerine shaved ice with red dragon fruit granita and mint - very refreshing. Dessert:- Buah keluak ice cream with valrhona chocolate, salted caramel, chili, warm milk chocolate sauce. The dessert had pop rocks in it. Flavor was good - interesting time read about the dying art of cultivating the buah keluak.- Nyonya kueh: traditional square of a small rice cake - Bunga telang tea: good with the rice cake I was stuffed - it was a good amount of food but the best way to try everything.  Based off our favorites from the tasting, from the a la carte menu, I would say get the crab curry, beef rendang, and the pork satay.  The tasting was 128 SGD per person plus tax/service fee. Overall, it was definitely a more unique dining experience than your usual European tasting menu, which I really appreciate. I think it's worth checking out for a good tasting of Perenakan cuisine."

Not ""refined"" -- just bland. The batter was undersalted. The soup had no body. The curries had no bite. This isn't Peranakan food, and calling it ""ahma's"" cooking is an insult to the legions of nonya grandmothers who put together better meals every night.Candlenut couldn't even nail the basics. The fried tofu was not crispy. The soft shelled shrimp was undersalted and tasted like fishy water when you bit into it. And somehow, nearly everything that should have been served hot hit our table at an unappetizing room temperature. We couldn't stomach most of the food.If I hadn't eaten at other restaurants that _were_ deserving of their Michelin stars, I'd never set foot in a guide-recommended establishment again. Not only is Candlenut a poor example of Peranakan food, it's not a well executed meal, period.I paid full price for this awful meal ($350 sgd).

Here I was, a week later... and what a culinary adventure!This is not your traditional Peranakan restaurant. Candlenut features many familiar ingredients that the Straits Chinese use, but it has creatively tweaked some recipes and on occasion created something new, the Buah Keluak ice cream for one. Having a non-discriminatory palate (and an open mind) is really the best way to make the most of your experience here.We went for the cheekily named 'ah-ma-kase' set menu which came with three appetisers, soup, salad and a selection of main courses. For appetisers, we had the Smoked Octopus Acar (spicy pickle), Kurobuta Pork Satay (tender, perfectly grilled, hints of paprika, accompanied by a sweet sauce), and the exceptionally delectable Kueh Pie Tee (wafer thin crispy shells filled with tasty crabmeat, subtle hints of lemongrass).Appetisers were quickly followed by Itek Tim, a savoury-sourish duck soup. Candlenut offered an interesting twist, adding spongelike taro stem to the soup and having the duck meat served as a meatball with minced mushrooms and pickled mustard cabbage.The main courses which came in generous portions, were served communal style. Mom's Curry Prawns was my favorite - giant prawns were first lightly grilled then cooked in a delicious lemongrass candlenut curry gravy. Grilled Red Snapper (drizzled with lime juice, lemongrass-onion-chilli sauce) was another outstanding dish. Duck Curry, aromatic from various ground spices, was cooked in a rendang style with the coconut curry thick and creamy. Wok-fried Pork Slices was another winner. Sautéed with prawn chilli sambal and shredded kaffir lime leaves, it delivered a remarkably fiery punch, punctuated by the distinctive citrusy notes of the lime leaves. Prawn Wing Bean Salad offered a refreshing light contrast to the other main dishes but as this was nearly the only greens in the set, I would have loved for it to come in a bigger serving. After a complimentary palate cleanser - lemongrass granita, we moved on to desserts. The Mao Shan Wang Durian Ice Cream was every bit as mouthwatering as its pedigree would have you anticipate. It was also a pretty scoop adorned with flowers and a rose cookie. Steamed Banana Cake was light and fluffy, pairing beautifully with the accompanying Gula Melaka ice cream. However the star in this section belonged to the Buah Keluak Ice Cream. Savoury bits of the distinctive earthly nut were mixed into the ice cream and there was also the delightful crunch of salted caramel. What a brilliant combination of flavours and textures.Traditional Peranakan cuisine will always be a part of Singapore's food culture. Notwithstanding, I applaud Candlenut's creative flair, and courage in pushing boundaries, and for its ambition to elevate Peranakan cuisine to levels of fine dining. Afterall didn't Peranakan cuisine evolve from an innovative fusion of cooking techniques and ingredients of 2 or more distinct cultures, necessitated in part by a need to adapt? Kudos, Chef Lee and his team."

The first course was probably my favorite, as it was very fresh. The rest of the experience was served family style, which actually felt like significantly less value for what we were paying, especially for a tasting menu. Admittedly, I am not one for super spicy food, but everything that came out was so spicy, I could not eat most of it, which was really disappointing. When the desserts came, I was so happy that there was something I could eat again, besides the rice and wine.I will say that the wine pairings were on point and very well paired.

Ambience is nice... the place is done up really nicely decor-wise and it felt quite sophisticated yet traditional. There were 6 of us so we ordered a good variety of dishes to share. My favorite dish was the charcoal grilled whole squid with fresh yellow tumeric sambal - really tender and fragrant, and was complemented well with the sambal, which was very flavorful. I'd also recommend the babi pongteh (braised duroc pork cheek pongteh) which was super tender. The ayam buah keluak was tasty too though I wish they left the whole nut inside for the experience... The one thing I wished though was if the server had asked us if we wanted to have a portion of the homemade sambal belachan to try - $2 per sharing portion. I mean... yes it's on the menu, and I don't agree with having to pay for it, but the point is that they didn't even ask... and I found the food not spicy enough.. it's a peranakan restaurant after all right?Dessert was expensive and absolutely nothing to shout about. I'd give it a miss if I find myself back there. Overall, not too bad ""refined"" peranakan food but I think you can find better elsewhere for cheaper and with more character."

I was glad to have found just one Michelin restaurant with Singaporean roots. I honestly must say, I was disappointed. Singaporean food, boasting strong flavors and rich spices, was not accurately reflected in the meal I had.The jackfruit curry was mild in flavor, without the strong spice flavors.The sambal was very tender, but the meat was quite shredded and the flavor, again, not as strong as the rich street foods we had tried.Singaporean food all should have strong enough flavors that require it to be paired with rice, but my rice bowl was still near full. Some advice for visitors: although Singapore may have the most number of Michelin Starred restaurants, if you want a local Singaporean experience, stick with the food markets and the local restaurants to truly get the Singaporean eating experience."

We had to make significant sacrifices to our schedule and beat the crazy Singapore traffic to just get here and then get turned away.

Since this is a fusion restaurant, I did not have high hopes, in spite of them having won a Michelin star. The restaurant decor is sparse but pleasant. Service was very attentive and really friendly. 5 stars. They had a regular menu you would expect from this type of restaurant, but with twists to the traditional recipes.  For example, the ayam buah  keluak had decent flavor but the emphasis was the chicken, whereas traditional food is the opposite. Likewise the prawn petai, flavors were there, but the emphasis was the fresh prawns, not the petai. All in all the food was decent, but not spectacular.  If you are expecting authentic peranakan, you will be disappointed. However they were true to their advertisement, fusion peranakan.

Located within Resorts World Sentosa, I got lost the first time I tried to find the restaurant. I've since learnt a trick which is to brave the hot, humid weather and walk outdoors where you can find the restaurant about a 5-minute walk away from the Casino escalators and opposite TungLok Heen by another Celebrity Chef Susur Lee. My last visit to Syun was a day before my departure to DC. As usual, I couldn't resist ordering Celebrity Chef Hal Yamashita's Signature Sea Urchin rolled by Wagyu Beef. Tender, marbled, melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu Beef rolled around buttery Hokkaido Uni with a tangy Ponzu sauce & topped with Caviar sure makes for one helluva palate-titillating ""Amuse Bouche""! I love the salad with Yuzu Ginger dressing too and I guess, these helped to contribute to my food coma midway through the meal. Mum loves Yellowtail so we had to order an a la carte portion of Hamachi Sashimi to go with our Bento lunch at Syun. Priced at SGD14 for 5 slices, these buttery chunks are a fab ""Amuse Bouche"" while we waited for the rest of the food to be served. If seafood's your thing, definitely try the Seafood House Special Jyu. Tender poached Prawns meets buttery Hokkaido Scallop, juicy butter-poached Salmon, creamy Hokkaido Uni, umami-rich Ikura pearls, earthy Shiitake Mushroom & crunchy Sugar Snap Peas! As if that wasn't decadent enough, a layer of fluffy, buttery scrambled eggs sat between the perfectly steamed grains of rice and treasures of the sea. I also like the Bara Chirashi Sushi Jyu. It's one of the prettiest I've ever had and has a decent variety of chunky sashimi.Served with Green Salad with Yuzu Ginger Dressing, Miso Soup and Chawanmushi, the Bentos at Syun are worth making a trip to Sentosa for."

For $15, it is a steal. Especially after you realize your tea cost $6!The uni is creamy and fresh and the wagyu is just melts in your mouth tender. Add the slight citrus taste of yuzu and saltiness of shoyu, it is just an explosion of taste which somehow works. The menu is limited for lunch as it is just lunch sets with ala carte sashimi. However the lunch set is very affordable as it starts from $18++ for the vegetable roll. There is also a children set which I am jealous of as it comes with a yuzu sorbet. The adult sets have no dessert. We ordered the bara chirashi set and it was so pretty. Sprinkled with flower petals (I assumed they were edible) and served with a wedge of lime. The lime was an unexpected twist and somehow it detracted from the raw fish. I could hardly discern the different fish in each mouthful as I felt the flower and lime overpowered it. However the chawanmushi was divine. It was soft like the original Rochor warm tau huay (bean curd) and it was also sweet from the seafood. The miso soup was clear and light. A dessert would really have ended the meal perfectly.Service was excellent. They watched the diners and would come round to top up the tea without being asked. There was also a side table for us to place our bags. Nice."

The menu isn't too expensive, roughly SGD $4 for a nigiri. Atmosphere is great and very 'Japanese' posh. There are even private rooms to entertain clients for those important meetings.

A wide variety of marinated meats, seafood options (think of Boston lobster, king prawns, crayfish, live mud crabs and more) even donburi. I've been here with my ex-colleagues a few years ago and really loved their fresh seafood and food options, but now with covid, the food is delivered to your table once you make your order via your phone using the unique QR code on each table. The staff will also walk around to help you refill the charcoal or provide you with more canned drinks.If you are too lazy to barbecue food, you can order these donburi, this is iberico pork donburi above and it comes with truffle flavoured rice and an onsen egg! Perfect for hangry folks who can't wait for food to be cooked!For any beef lover, the wagyu beef cubes are amazingly juicy when barbecued. The good thing about ordering via QR code, is you can spam the number of portions, so the portion below was close to 15 servings. And for satay, 1 satay is 1 serving, so 10 servings is what I would recommend, because the satays are so good Reservations are highly recommended as they can be fully booked. Parking is free and there's a large car park, so no trouble finding parking. There's also a nearby playground for kids to burn some energy.Overall, the wagyu beef cubes were by far the best item we tried, and we kept ordering more and more. Same for the satay. The seafood were fresh and cooking them with various condiments like cheese was fun and appetising at the same time. I love the free parking and the ambience and would gladly re-visit."

Certainly not cheap, but eating here reminded me WHY food can cost this much in the first place - you're paying for a meal that you enjoy in the simplest and fullest understanding of the word.The deli made for a fun wander-through as you waited for your food, though it felt a bit small - probably to make room for the dining space.

Culina produces reasonably good quality food. A recent change in chef has meant we miss some of the ways some dishes are prepared but still, we think this place is great to sit, people watch while enjoying steak, pasta or the like which are all cooked well.What disappointed me and caused me to score it one star is the service. While Culina has the basics and generally their floor staff cannot be faulted, they clearly lack a competent sommelier and an empowered assistant manager. For a place that serves wine, it is intolerable to not have someone who can provide sound advice on wine on their standard list and the wine in their deli section. It is also intolerable to not have someone who understands customer relationship management and to make the executive decisions in this space when a customer is complaining about a legitimate issue.Last night, we ordered our regular favorite bottle of wine from their store which we paid corkage for on top of the deli pricing. On tasting, it was badly heat damaged. We raised the concern and the assistant manager decided to stand firm and insisted it was not heat damaged. She pushed the fact that the whole batch has been sitting here and there is nothing wrong with it.I won't pretend to assume I am an expert but in my 20 years, I know when wine is heat damaged or not. We have had this same bottle of wine on many occasions here in Culina prior to last night. Same year. Same vintage. It WAS perfect.She offered to decant and we eventually opened a second bottle. Also heat damaged. In the end, we paid for the bottle but hardly touched the wine still sitting in the decanter and the first glass she poured it in. She never offered any form of apology or suggested to replace the wine with another vintage despite this.This place used to be a staple for us for steak and wine. It is now off the list until someone informs us a competent sommelier is in place. Or a competent manager. Preferably both."

They serve excellent bread and wine. But this had a lot of people in an uproar. I heard from a very upset friend that they apparently have a corkage charge if wine is consumed on the premises. I usually just blindly pay my bill, but could you say way to capitalize much?Besides from that my personal experience aside, I've only heard good things about this restaurant. It's a fantastic place for a Sunday lunch, or a lunch anytime at all. Great place to sit down with you buddies for some quality bonding. Generally I am very happy with this restaurant.

I didn't see any bottled tomato sauce, which surprised me. (I guess I'll head across the street to Jones the Grocer for that, as they have a nice selection there.) Their produce and bread selection is small, but everything looked fresh. It seems they put more of a focus on their wines and their butchery.I guess I had my hopes a bit too high, as I felt the store overall was lacking. I think it's because it's in a small space, and it's simply a ""gourmet"" grocer - gourmet in a VERY broad sense, as it doesn't focus on a specific cuisine. Still, I lust after their high end stuff and once I start working, I might treat myself to a few items from here. :) I don't think this will be my go-to spot for fancy shmancy shenanigans, but if I'm in the area wouldn't hesitate to drop by."

They'd officially get 3.5 for me. I called in advance to make a reservation for 6 the day before and my husband requested outside seating.We got there and the architecture of the building reminded me a lot of the Jim Thompson museum in Bangkok. We were seated outside and got to watch 3 women dressed in Thai garb dance the whole evening. It was a little warm out and the patio did not have fans, so if you overheat easily (especially when noshing on spicy Thai food), I recommend grabbing a table inside.The drinks were good, but a little pricey at approximately $24 each. The mojitos were wonderful and so was the Jim Thompson Cooler. My husband and I started out with the Chef's Special Appetizer ($32) and it came with chicken satay, tiger prawns, crab spring rolls, marinated grilled beef rolls, and minced chicken salad. Sauces were brought out for all and they were delicious. We were actually able to order brown rice here in order to try to stick to our Paleo lifestyle. The rice was very earthy, a bit crunchy and delicious with the green curry and beef. We also got the half rotisserie Thai chicken ($26), which was cooked perfectly. In addition to this, we got the morning glory vegetable ($14) for the table. The food was excellent, and the service was friendly. They did get a little swamped shortly after we got there and we did have to ask for our second round of drinks a few times. The ambiance was lovely, and the food was good. If you're looking for a nice restaurant for a special occasion, this is a great choice."

The ambience of the restaurant is just fantastic. They have a vegetarian menu for folks like me - that's just fabulous.  We ordered coconut water to quench our thirst, what a way to get refreshed quickly!  It's served in the coconut and they even give you a spoon to scoop out the soft coconut flesh to eat once you are done drinking the water. We had the green curry, cashew tofu, fried rice and regular rice. Everything was delicious. We didn't have room for dessert.

What I like about Thai is that you don't need to spend much to experience great food, but hey, there's nothing wrong with splurging every now and then (or so I keep telling myself!)Jim Thompson sets the tone immediately when you arrive. As it's outside Dempsey Hill, it's a bit more secluded, which gives off this feeling of being personally invited to someone's beautiful black and white home. At the entrance, there are ladies dressed in traditional Thai clothing that greet you in Thai, complete with the slight bow and palms pressed together. Walking inside, the decor was quite opulent. Nice silk decorations (after all... this is Jim Thompson we're talking about), occasional live music, and a beautiful bar.I dined here with my husband and his auntie, and we chose 2 curries, Pad Thai, and a veggie side dish. We all thought everything was well done. I thoroughly enjoyed my beef Mussaman curry (as it wasn't spicy) and the red curry with grapes blew me away. I thought the grapes would be weird (what can I say, sometimes my tastes are like that of a 5 year old) but it added sweetness that complemented the savoury curry very well. And the Pad Thai? Absolutely wonderful, it's one of the best Pad Thai's we've had outside Thailand! The crowd on a weekday night was majority expats, and it seemed like a lot of business meetings were going down. It's definitely a place to file under ""Special Occasion"", ""Important Business Meeting"", or ""I'm Feeling Generous, Let Me Invite My Favourite CM Michelle To Jim Thompson Just Because""."

I would never recommend this restaurant and am appalled by the number of people that actually think this is good food.We ordered the 3 person starter with Spring Rolls, Chicken Wings, Pomelo Salad and Prawn Cakes. At $44 dollars this was the worst decision of the evening. There was no spice, no flavor and no salt at all. Everything was deep fried to a point where that's all you could taste. We had the Green Curry & Red Curry with beef, equally unimaginative, and a Pad Thai that was cold and tasteless.The three of us spent $284-- infuriatingly expensive for a miserable meal."

As a Thai living in Singapore, I always feel Thai foods here lack creativity (same old menus everywhere), flavors and most importantly authenticity. Jim Thompson is a well-known name for silk products in Thailand and if you have a chance to visit Bangkok, his old house near to National Stadium BTS Station is a place not to miss.It was my birthday yesterday and two of my lovely friends called me for a treat at this place in Dempsey. First of all, the ambience of the restaurant  was great. There are 2 areas for dining (outdoor and indoor) and both are equally well decorated. We chose to sit inside because we really needed an air-conditioner. We had a reservation at 7.30 and when we reached the place at 7.40, it was about half full. Soon after 8, the place started to fill quickly. We were greeted by Thai staff dressing in traditional Thai dress. We ordered 4 dishes and drinks. My drink was Jim Thompson Mojito, which was decent and quite refreshing for a scorching night in Singapore. They do not serve tap water here so we also ordered a big bottled water (Jim Thompson's brand). The foods were served together about 20 minutes later.Pomelo Salad (old recipe) - it was ok. The taste was moderately mild and I wouldn't call it having genuine Thai flavors. There is another pomelo salad dish in the menu but we chose this one instead as it was chef's recommendationTom Yam Hed Ruam (Mixed Mushroom Seafood Tom Yam) - it was clear Tom Yam style but the taste was a little off. It was a bit too sour and less salty and spicy than the usual Tom Yam we have in Thailand. We ordered a small portion and it was divided into 3 small bowls for us. This dish was kinda catered to foreigners in my view.Grilled Chicken (special Jim Thompson's menu) is claimed to be cooked for 18 hours. It is served with sweet and spicy sauce. I liked this dish. The chicken was soft and tender. The skin was also slightly crispy with sweet and salty flavor.Fried Broccoli with Hoy Shell (scallops) - standard dish, it was tasty!2 desserts - durian with sticky rice: good but not great - each ingredient (durian, sticky rice and coconut milk) was separated so it was pretty easy to share among friends. The other dessert was Bua Loy Puek - decent but I would prefer that the Bua Loy have more taro and or flavor in it.After we finished the meal, my friend informed the waitress that it was my birthday today. 10 minutes later, a group of staff came out with a platter of fresh fruits singing Happy Birthday for me! It was complimentary and I felt very impressed.BTW, throughout our dinner there was a girl doing traditional dancing. She walked all over the restaurant while dancing. This is a plus point for the place.Overall, I would not say that the foods here were authentic but they were great and I am sure that foreigners will enjoy the foods here (even I did enjoy a lot). The service was excellent and the Thai decoration of the place was top-notched! I deducted one star because of its high price (small portion like what you get in Thailand)."

Nestled in the jungle of Dempsey Hill, this restaurant almost seems like an an oasis among the scores of beautiful trees that line the restaurant. I went for dinner with my wife and my aunt visiting from Hong Kong. We were greeted by thai dancers strutting their stuff to traditional thai music, not to mention, the all too familiar words of ""Sawadee ka."" The decor within the restaurant is sublime. It's probably best to see the pictures to see what I mean. This restaurant oozes with ""expat"" appeal and is evident by the restaurant's patrons.  I, for one, like to go to Thai restaurants where there are a lot of Thais in order to personally certify the restaurant food's authenticity. Although Thai patrons were few and far between, the food, nonetheless, was very good and authentic.   Our order included Pad Thai, Beef Mussaman Curry and a veggie Thai Dish. The Pad Thai was the best I've had in Singapore. It's probably because Pad Thai is the THE expat dish of Thailand and this dish has to be a hit in order for this restaurant to bring its target demographic. As for the Mussaman Curry, I second my wife when she says it wasn't too spicy. My only compliant about the restaurant, believe it or not, is the ridiculously small portion white rice they give. :D Overall, the restaurant is just beautiful and the food is a sure fire winner. Personally, I would not pay these lofty prices for Thai Food, as there are so many great Thai options in Singapore and with Thailand a short place ride away, but the ambiance, experience and the backdrop of Dempsey Hill is all built into the price!"

The tasty plummy chilli dip did little to save the overdone appetizer.2) Khao Phad Nam Lieb ($20) - rice fried with black olives and minced chicken, sided by raw shallots, lime dice, cashews, and chillis: one of two dishes that actually passed muster, this had a good amount of flavour and char.3) Gaeng Panang Neau ($24) - panang curry with Australian beef tenderloin, coconut cream, and crushed peanuts: the other commendable dish, but it would have been better served piping hot, instead of tepid.4) Phad Grapow Gai ($22) - stir-fried minced chicken with straw mushrooms, garlic, birds eye chilli, and holy basil: should have been punchy but it was disappointingly vapid.5) Pla Ga Pong Daeng Thod Gra Tiem ($22) - deep-fried red snapper fillets blanketed in an gooey garlic sauce: let down by the less than sparkling fresh fish. The muddy taste of the fish overwhelmed the lovely sauce"

Our hotel recommended this spot so off we went, late on a Sunday night. Have no fear, this spot is open til 1 AM daily!The menu is absolutely massive with delicacies from the ocean, but we came here for one thing...famous chili mud crabs! Long Beach is also known for black pepper crabs too, but we wanted to try this national delicacy on our last night. The crab is 1.2 kilos and came in a vat of chili sauce, piping hot. We also got some fried buns for dipping on the side.We were provided wet naps and a bowl of calamansi water to dip our fingers, but luckily were seated by a washing station with soap and paper towels also. I visited that station quite a bit.Our server and other staff were hilarious - it was a fun atmosphere. Eric R. asked for  ""jumbo"" water glasses and that is the competitor's name, so he got a hard time in a funny way and it was amusing! The staff put a big pitcher of water on a saucer on our table to appease him! We also got some Tiger beer pints.We sat outside because the inside felt cold at the entry way. Our hotel told us this is a very casual spot, and we saw a variety of people dressed from super casual like us, who came from the zoo, to fancily dressed people. One look at the vat of chili crab would explain why you do not want to be dressed up for this experience. I saw some folks inside wearing bibs but we just went for it and got splattered. The crab cracker tool was very slippery because we could not keep it from getting wet, but it was effective! Eric R. never likes working for food - he said he prefers not to shell shrimp, crack crab or crawfish, or even going to Korean BBQ (shabu shabu and hot pot are exceptions apparently), but he thought this was definitely worth the effort. Our noses were running and our hands were messy, but our bellies were happy and full! This was really fun. Be aware that while this is a casual place, there is a huge menu of abalone and other fancy fishes, and set menus priced up to 800 SGD per person...whoa! Crabs are market price but one order was plenty for two, probably just a bit too much for us, so we did not get appetizers or sides beyond the fried buns for dipping. Enjoy!"

So, no, you don't need to tip - despite their pressure and hovering.  Don't eat the appetizers and bring your own napkins / wet naps.  I'm not sure I would come here again - I would probably like to try chili crab somewhere else.  I do wish I would have had a taste of of the black pepper crab though.  Perhaps another time, another place."

More specifically the iconic Singapore chili crab.A perfectly steamed from live mud crab (Samoan crab to Hawaii Yeeps) claws the size of your hand.  Shell cracked then basted in a fresh chili sauce, fragrant herbs, a touch of sugar, and thickened by eggs.  Messy to eat (wear your bib or be prepared to toss your shirt) but so tasty. The warming but not thermonuclear chili flavor, draws out the natural sweetness of the crab. The meat itself, very firm in texture, closer to lobster that crab.  A side of montou (deep fried sweet buns) the perfect accompaniment to mop up the delicious sauce. Heck, they even provide a bowl and spoon so you do not let any of the delicious sauce go to waste, it's filled with the female crab eggs after all..Do not pass on the black pepper crab.  Invented by Long Beach Seafood, outstanding.  The same mud crab, perfectly steamed, shells cracked, but this time sautéed in very finely ground, copious quantities of black pepper.  The dry roasted pepper corns, very spicy, aromatic, with no bitter or acrid flavors. It works even better at bringing out the sweetness of the  crab.  Outstanding.Add a few additional fresh seafood dishes to round out the meal. The razor clam, ordered by the piece, steamed in a gentle soy garlic sauce and topped with vermicelli and crispy garlic is exceptional. The clams, well cleaned and perfectly cooked display and oceanic sweetness and texture of an abalone more than a clam.Crunchy deep-fried prawns cooked from live with freshly fried garlic also amazing. The restaurant knows how to tease the sweetness out of the best seafood.  This prawn dish can be ordered with or without the shell.Note: crab dishes can be done with the traditional mud crab, Australian Crystal crab, or Alaskan King crab though why mess with tradition. Market price by the kilo. 1 kg minimum.What to drink? Tiger beer of course.Service is extremely efficient but always with a smile.  It is surprising that there are no accidents in the hectic dining room with servers rushing between tables.Advance booking required at all locations. Use the website.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Despite the heat, dine outdoors so the food doesn't cool too quickly.Although the food sounds humble, seafood is rarely inexpensive. This dinner for two inclusive of four beers, tax, and service exceeded $250 SGD. it was worth every penny.I truly cannot wait to get back to fingering one of my favorite crabs of all time"

This menu started off with the salted egg prawns!! This was very tasty  that I wanted to eat more of the seasoning as it goes really well with the prawns. Next up was the Canadian dungeoness crab. Looks black all over because of the black pepper seasoning. So yummy and a bit peppery hot. The steamed fish came out and it also was quite soft and  flavorful. If you're not into fish then I would skip this. The 'FuJin' Qin long vegetables was also a dish that was a non stop eating for me. The 'soup' with the veggies was so good too. I could eat this forever. The silver fish and sprouts rice came up next and we ate a little because we were so full!! Last but not least was the lime lemongrass aloe jelly dessert. It was cool to the mouth on a humid night. All in all this was a last good dinner for the trip. Should have came here to begin with so we could eat it again and again!

No joke, that dish is legit!   However, this place serves a lot of different carb dishes like the Black Pepper Crab (good) and the White Pepper Crab (the best, IMO).  They had other delicious dishes here, but the most memorable were these three crabs.  You can also request the server to (table-side) remove the shell for you (what!??!!).  It's obviously less messy to eat and more enjoyable.  So if you're on that CRA tour, then swing by here and try their crabs.  I'm telling you, it's been a few months and those crabs are still very memorable for me."

If you're lucky, they'll have enormous crabs available which are the absolute best!!! They cost a pretty penny but it's so worth it when you can dunk that giant claw in all the delicious chilli crab sauce. The sauce is so good, I eat it with everything - the crab, additional prawns that I order on the side, mantou (steamed or fried buns, I prefer steamed), mee goreng. If there's a lot leftover, I even take it home to toss with pasta the next day.They do good seafood overall - I've had good experiences with their steamed clams (bamboo clams or pacific clams), prawns (the drunken or steamed ones are my favorite), baby squid (fried in a sweet black sauce that I love), geoduck (expensive but yummy). They also have some good vegetable sides and I really like the mee goreng. Especially when you can eat the mee goreng with the remaining chilli crab sauce. Yum.Because I don't eat crabs in any other style, I consistently come back just for the chilli crabs which are truly the best thing available here. I've had chilli crab in many other restaurants and none of them come close to what Long Beach offers at Dempsey. I've found that their standards can be a little inconsistent in other outlets but Dempsey has always been consistently delicious! Service is great too - you can get plastic gloves and bibs to protect your clothes and hands when handling all that seafood. It just makes the entire experience more pleasant (and it's also great when you don't go home with chilli crab sauce all over your top)."

I loved the crispiness of the shrimp and how they incorporated salty egg yolk. The accompanying crunchy cereal would really satisfy people who like fried stuff or intense flavors. I also really enjoyed the mini squid. I forgot what it was called specifically but the mini squid was lightly fried and had a dark brown sauce over it. It again was crunchy and the sauce was slightly salty but had great flavor. I also had their veggies and other dishes which were all pretty good. The restaurant was big but we still made a reservation to be safe. Everyone was really nice and greeted us with great smiles. If I were back in Singapore, I would def come back!"

Your life isn't complete without going to Long Beach Seafood when you're in Singapore.My husband and I were skeptical about going out of the way for this restaurant. We were staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Marina Bay. Getting to Dempsey Hill was a hassle and there are so many other good food options closer to us. Still a local coworker insisted that we try Long Beach Seafood... And thus the journey to great food began...Public transit was a hassle. We took the green line on the MRT (train) to Commonwealth then took the 105 bus to Opp Pierce. From there, we walked across a pedestrian bridge, across a lawn, up a hill, thru a construction zone, passed several parking areas and VOILA! We finally arrived. Somehow we ended up in the back of the restaurant? The really nice wait staff ushered us to the front. *whew*Instead of testing our luck at picking random things on the menu, we went with a pre-selected dinner menu. The meal for 2 people cost $148 SGD (which was about $110 USD). Razor clams hadn't been delivered as a result of bad weather... So instead, they gave us some other clams as substitutes but prepared the same way as the razor clams. These were the best clams I've ever had. The clams were stuffed with garlic glass noodles and clam meat. There was also a light soy sauce that complimented the dish. The savory dish was light, flavorful, and left you wishing for more!Up next was the leek flower blossom. I never had this before but it was so very delicious! The leek flower blossom was cooked but still had a nice crunch. Again, it was a very light dish even though it appeared to be stir-fried or sautéed. The main dish was the black pepper crab. This was a life changing experience! The black pepper sauce was thick, flavorful, and spicy! It complimented the huge chucks of crab meat we dig out of the claws. Not only did was this finger licking good, I almost kicked my plate clean!!! I seriously had to go wash my hands and face after this yummy dish.We also had the flat rice noodles with ""la la King"" sauce, which was a thick gravy sauce with clams and topped with crispy friend wontons. The flavor of this dish was very subtle and elegant.Lastly, we had an amazing dessert of pudding with ice cream and a mango sauce. No words could possibly describe light and yummy this dish was. You'll just have to go try it for yourself!The wait staff was so very kind and attentive. We never had to ask for anything bc they were always a step ahead of us. Our waiter even called a taxi for us to get back to our hotel.The restaurant was also very clean. The food/restaurant standards in Singapore should be commended."

We added a chili crab to our order so that we can get a taste of both and we all liked the black pepper crab better. The veggie dish and noodles were quite good also, rounded out with a dessert (some kind of warm taro paste, yum).As newbies all dining here for the first time, we didn't know we could ask for bibs, gloves, and scissors for the crab! When we saw the tables next to us with these awesome amenities, we were very sad as we just didn't know to ask.The weird thing about this restaurant is they have pictures of scantily clad women on the napkin covers and menus which makes the place seem very cheap and sleazy... I thought that was quite weird. Also weird are the beer girls. When you order beer, they pour for you. These girls wear Tiger outfits which consists of a very short one piece miniskirt dress thingy.

The chili crab was good but the other dishes on the value set menu were dudes.  Especially the seasonal greens with dried scallop and crab - I couldn't find any crab in the dish just egg white cooked to resemble crab and a few strands of dried scallop swimming in a cornstarch gloop.  The pan-fried noodle ""la la King"" was just as deceptive - about six tiny baby clam shells which only had 3 filled with clams again drowning in a heavy corn-starched sauce.  Consistency must be the restaurant's strong suit because the coconut jelly dessert was almost inedible, Non-descript gelatin covered in coconut milk sprinkled with a few tapioca balls.  The evening started out bad when the waiter brought black pepper crab to my table after I ordered the chili crab.  Basically he pleaded that he would have to pay for the mix up in dishes but after I insisted that I wanted the chili crab did he take back the black pepper.  Not an enjoyable or relaxing meal when you feel you have to defend your menu selection and stand up for your rights, only to realize that this is a tourist trap orchestrated from the beginning to maximize your check - from the strategic placing of the non-complimentary appetizer and wet wipes on your table.  I had to ask for napkins since they didn't have any on the table, another ploy to buy the wet wipes.  Save your round trip taxi fare and $200 SGD (value menu plus 2 small mantou, a Tiger beer, and bottled water).  I was still yearning for good Singaporean seafood after this horrible dining experience."

I don't like overly flavored food so for me to want extra flavor means this wasn't done right. 2. Tofu with lightly fried fish toppings - this dish was okay. Good balance between the sauce and the tofu was firm but soft at the same time. 3. Duck - skip this dish. It's dry and bland. Had to drown it in the sweet sauce to give it some flavor.4. Steamed fish - don't remember the type of fish but it was okay. The fish was cooked well and flavored were a good mix. 5. Fried fish - a little on the dry side but it was tasty. 6. White pepper and black crab - the white pepper  ran was my favorite dish here. It was smokey but not too smokey like the black pepper crab. Most of my friends like the black pepper crab though. They liked the spicy smokiness. 7. Lo Mein noodles  with fish and squid I believe -  this dish was good. Has good balance of salty and sweet. Texture of the noodles were good. Firm but also soft. 8. The fried buns - these were so good. They're plain but good at holding the flavors of whatever dish you liked the most by dipping them into their sauce. Would definitely order these. 9. Chili Crab - no bueno. Would not order. The sauce was too sweet and tangy in a bad way. Tasted as though they removed it from a can and heated it up in the microwave...shame. That's the reason we went to this place. 10. Fried rice with little bits of fish - you can't see the fish but you can taste it. This dish was good as well. Would definitely order. 11. Another fried rice dish with chunks of fish, onions, scallions and egg - would skip this dish. Not good. The combination of the ingredients and sauce did not work. 12. The garlic clams - too much garlic and clams were chewy. Not the best. Would skip. 13. Bok choi and mushroom soup - gooey texture of the soup threw me off. Was not a fan.Overall, would probably not go back unless I had to for some strange reason. Also, not the friendliest staff either."

There're several Long Beach outlets all over Singapore but we ended up here since it's located in the trendy Dempsey area. Reservations are highly recommended since they're often packed for dinner seems like practically every day. More so on the weekends. We took the chance without reservations since we were there early and it was just the 2 of us. They did have a table but also told us we might have to finish our dinner within an hour or so. So what happens if we didn't? Didn't get to find out.Despite that initial hitch, service was friendly and nice. They offered to take our photos without asking (yes, I was being a tourist) and the food arrived soon after we ordered. One medium sized crab cooked in pepper sauce and another in chilli sauce came along with fried rice (can't recall the name but it has bits of Otah in it)- Pepper crab: stir fried with finely ground black pepper sauce that gets into every nook and cranny of the crab. Good complex flavor with garlic and mild heat from the pepper. - Chilli crab: This is the highlight for me as the crab is swimming in the chilli sauce. Lacks the complexity of the pepper version but the eggy and mildly spicy sauce hits the spot. Drizzle this on rice or dip the fried bread rolls in the sauce, either way, I could live on this stuff. Great food and above average service but expect to pay for it. Total tab for the 2 crabs, fried rice came to just over S$100. Pretty pricey in my book but then again, Singapore ain't cheap."

A friend took the remaining sauce home and made a nice pasta the next day.   In addition to the crab, I'd also recommend the crispy duck and the Thai-style steamed fish. The duck especially is one of the best I've had anywhere. Crispy, chewy, meaty, and packed with flavor. I can gnaw on its bones! Service and ambience are so-so, and it's on the expensive side.

The preparation of the dish is a tad disturbing though - they dump the live prawns into the broth in front of you and you may have to watch it shiver and jump in the throes of death. Not for the faint-hearted. Another famous dish here is the black pepper crab but it is a little too sweet for my liking.One thing that I have grown to appreciate about Long Beach is that it is such a typical Chinese restaurant - impatient and boisterous waitresses, a dish of peanuts of a complimentary appetizer and dubious looking chinese tea that tastes pretty much just like hot water."

We had their famous black pepper crab and although the smokey pepper flavor was unique there was nothing special about it.  We also tried their fried lobster which is decent but the other dishes were medicore at best.  We had high hopes for this restaurant given the great reviews but the whole meal was kinda of underwhelming. Like other reviewers mentioned the restaurant does nickel and dime you on wet napkins and other stuff.  The part that really irritated me was they charged us for an appetizer when they were they placed a small dish on the table but didn't mention there was a charge to it.  Most restaurants that usually place an item on the table as you sit down give you that item for free. This place didn't even tell us there was a charge for this tiny dish that other restaurants provide for free.  We spent over $200 dollars for two people but by far this was definitely not worth price for their 3 star food and one star service.  You could get the same crab at local hawker restaurants for less than half the price this place charges.

The razor clams are much bigger than I've gotten elsewhere on the island, and were absolutely worth the premium price. Very fresh, sweet, tender, yet with a good amount of chew, and a great garlicky sauce. The sea bass in thai sauce was average but not bad.

It has a rather decent sized parking lot which is free of charge for customers. The White Rabbit is more of an upscale fine dining place you would take someone to celebrate a special meal with. It is also a beautifully restored 1930s Ebenezer chapel!The White Rabbit resides in a restored old chapel along the stretch of Dempsey Hill. The historical establishment itself is very captivating in creating a unique 'Alice in Wonderland' concept of The White Rabbit, attempting to bring you to another world. There's a very cute outdoor dining area lined with lounge chairs. The staff explained that they were setting up a wedding the next door. I can definitely see this place being used for weddings. I am glad that they managed to preserve the stained glass from when this was a place of worship. The atmosphere in the chapel was peaceful and romantic with ceiling lights as well very powerful air conditioning systems. So much so, that they staff offered us ladies, scarves or even warm water instead of cold water.1. Truffle Mac and Cheese with mushrooms $16++Though this is an appetizer portion. It had alot of mac and cheese and thus, became very filling quickly. The amount of truffle added to the mac and cheese was very significant and you could smell and taste it. They were generous with the mushrooms as well! The texture of the cheese was warm enough to enjoy and yet stick all the macaroni together.There was also bread service. I picked tomato basil bread, and since the bread is all freshly baked in house. The bread was piping hot and extremely crisp to begin with. The provided butter melted immediately once I applied it into the bread. 2. Deconstructed Cheese Cake $18++This was an interesting dessert. The wait staff asked me to mix up everything on the plate as there was graham crumble, blueberry sorbet and pop rocks all layered one on top of the other. The cream cheese wasn't too sweet or sour. The pop rock popped in your mouth in every mouthful. It was definitely a surprise for me. I enjoyed that the graham crackers were crumbles instead of a hard crust, that you would find in any typical cheesecake. This way, you could enjoy the graham crackers bit by bit.3. Chocolate Fondant $16++The chocolate fondant consisted of a caramel core lava cake with fruits and banana and rum ice cream. The lava cake wasn't moist on the exterior, but rather it was bread crust like. On the inside, was a small pocket of caramel that flowed out like liquid gold! The banana and rum ice cream was full of creamy goodness. I guess to compliment all the sweet stuff, all the fruits provided were sour?All in all, a very beautiful place to spend time with your loved ones. The food and the ambience are both top notch!"

It's just a pen dude, come on. Even if I were to take it, what's the big deal? I wouldn't. It's just a pen. 5 stars - the venue really is amazing. It's just a shame the service can't live up to the food and venue. I really wouldn't mind paying more for food if the service was superb. I think that's one thing Singapore needs to work on, the customer service. For some reason, they're a little Chinese in the service sense where they won't take the time to make sure the customer is satisfied. They just get things done and that's it k thanks bye.

As always, the place is enchanting because it was an old church. The stained coloured glass is always nice to stare at if you would like to avoid some conversation with whoever you are having a meal with. HahahaThe appetizer was nothing to shout out about as I had a salad printemps and a few of the rest had the salad nicoise. I had the pork collar, which I think was quite a fatty piece of meat. I wouldn't recommend this to any of my girlfriends seriously. A few of us had the seabass that came in a pot and wrapped in plastic bag, which was interesting. I think they also say that the seabass taste good.The side dishes we have ordered, apart from the set lunch were good, especially the truffled mac and cheese. The portion was really tiny. A portion could serve 3 people, I believe.  We also ordered grilled asparagus and fries which were average in my opinion. It is definitely a lovely ambience for a date night or even just a girls' night out sort of place."

The scallops were absolute perfection. They were in a delicious sauce that was thick and rich. I should have ordered two orders of scallops and that probably would have been a perfect meal. I selected the pork belly as my main course. I was rather disappointed in it. It was fairly flavourless and way too fatty. The White Rabbit staff was attentive and kind. We had a large group and they did everything they could to accommodate us comfortably. I am not sure whether or not I will be back. I don't feel like anything was amazing enough to draw me back.

I particularly enjoyed the latter - smoked salmon can so often be more salt than flavor, but not here. it was served a sizeable portion, with a heartiness I normally only associate with hot-smoked salmon (which I love, incidentally).the steak with eggs was pretty good too, with our beef done perfectly medium rare and pink and topped with two perfectly done sunny-side-ups.but if you're in the mood for something heartier, they also have a more lunch-type section with things like a proper beef burger (slightly over-minced (which leads to a mushier, less chunky patty, though still acceptable) and a salad nicoise with not-too-salty anchovies and colourful salad leaves.mind you, I say heartier in the sense of flavor rather than any indication of size. the portions here vary from small to reasonable, so don't be expecting anything remotely close to belly-busting.we finished with the waffles, since their rather famous white chocolate souffle wasn't available - this is possibly the only dish I'd steer clear of, seeing as how it was both anemic and biscuit-like (these really should be contrary adjectives, seeing how the first indicates lack of cooking, and the latter indicates rather too much). the only saving grace were the tart berries and ice cream. go for the affogato instead, which has a scoop of great ice cream over a satisfyingly bitter shot of espresso.service is pretty hit-and-miss. we waited a goodly amount of time for our food to arrive, so the portions did seem paltry at arrival - but it's otherwise friendly when you can get it. prices are commensurate with the venue rather than dish size, and so don't expect anything cheap - but come at least to see the place, and bask in the whole posh brunchness of the place."

Unfortunately the chapel was also an echo chamber, so it was a very noisy environment and frankly spoilt the ambience. Not a great place for an intimate evening. They should install sound dampeners to sort it out. Service was attentive and very good. The food was also excellent. Taste and presentation was all superb. The goose liver came with apple, apple sauce, micro greens and a rich balsamic vinegar. Perfectly balanced to the rich liver. For mains we had the beef short rib that had been slow cooked for 36 hours. Fork tender and incredible flavor. A really good dish.  Mother had the Dover sole. A decent choice, but it came slightly overcooked. Dessert was a deconstructed cheesecake and crepe Suzette. The cheesecake was unusual. Not your typical heavy cake. The cheese was whipped and therefore very light. It came with a raspberry ice cream which went very well. The crepe Suzette was also good, though it was a tad thick and as such had insufficient sauce. Nonetheless it was decent. Overall a very nice dinner. Cost wise, pricy but worth it. Recommended."

Inconsistency in service does not warrant those  5 stars. Save it for some other restaurant that deserves it. Here's my experience at The White Rabbit:I made a reservation for 2 at 9pm on 12th February. Arrived earlier than my reservation time and was told to wait a while for my table to be ready. An hour plus later and even asking about the table (was told to wait another 5 minutes), I wasn't even approached once by the service staff to inform me that there was a delay. The service was really bad. Not only didn't I get my table, I also had not received any calls to inform or ask me whether was I coming. If they're not interested then this isn't worth anyone's time.  By the way, I made the reservation a week prior to this date, and yet the booking was messed up. I would have appreciate it if someone had bothered to explain why was our table was delayed and served us asap, but none of that happened, I wasn't even stopped when I walked out of the doors. So much for service. Why do you even take reservations in the first place?It was already around 10ish when I left to look for another dinner place. My dinner mood was ruined by the staff at The White Rabbit and being hungry made nothing better. Zero stars if I could. 1 star for the so-so mocktail I had while waiting and the fact that I couldn't rate any lower. Count your blessings, rabbit."

It was holding its annual Halloween party, with this year's theme being The Superstition Ball. Seriously, this place is so mad awesome. The whole place is divided into an indoor restaurant (which is more relevant to the second part of this review on its brunch) and an outdoor area. The outdoor area called the Rabbit Hole has a sheltered portion with a full bar and a garden area reminiscent of a cloister. Splendid architectural concept for people to weave seamlessly between the dance floor to groove to the DJ music and the 'cloister' for a cozy chat. Drinks are on a slightly pricey end (I think I paid $21 for my raspberry mojito which was not alcoholic enough ...). But the music was so good - don't expect Top40 hits here ... but an upbeat electrifying remix of hip-hop/classics/cheese/trance. I would definitely be back here for more of its theme parties or even on a usual night-out!So on its brunch menu! Where should I start? The restaurant is a remodeled chapel and with its Victorian-style furniture, its timeless elegance could not be more accentuated. The early afternoon sunlight filtered into the restaurant through the stained glass, suffusing the place with a romantic atmosphere.All the servers were clad in smart white uniform (think the white rabbit from Alice in Wonderland) - and the service was impeccable, besides a slight slip - one of the servers accidentally served us the wrong dish ... but she was quick to realise so (oh well ... but the dish she brought up to us was so obviously waffles not brioche french toast, as introduced by her). Water was refilled very promptly and the manager checked on us to make sure that everything was good.The food - oh man, where should I start again? A White Rabbit's brunch regular brought me here and according to him, the restaurant's signature brunch dishes were the Eggs Benedict and Brioche French Toast. We got a serving of Eggs Benedict each and split the French Toast (the only way to resolve the savoury-or-sweet-brunch-contention).Eggs Benedict with salmon: The poached eggs could be more runny, to create a more volcanic effect upon rupture. Otherwise, the hollandaise sauce was quite good with an adequate zesty punch! The smoked salmon was fresh. The English muffin was nicely toasted, moist in the inside and packed by a crunchy exterior. I am a massive Eggs Benedict fan (having tried tonnes of them in Europe and the States) ... this is premium Eggs Benedict I would say. The side salad (fresh greens tossed in Balsamic Vinegar) was so good as well ... a perfect light complement to the more flavourful Eggs Benedict.Brioche French Toast: The mango bits on top of the French toast were some pockets of bomb! Sweet, but not sickly sweet - that's the WHOLE point of having FRUITS on french toast - they have to be sweet (not sour), but not overly sweet to steal the show from the french toast. Peanut butter and jam were sandwiched within the pleasantly caramelised brioche ... and with the maple syrup (above average, but not so much of a bomb) drizzled over the toast ... I was sent to cloud nine.I enjoyed my brunch experience here tremendously - I am so sure that I would be back here again!Also, for the non-drivers and anti-cabbing peeps, there is a cobbled path, cutting across the grass field (across the road from the restaurant), which is a short-cut to the nearest bus stop (quite a few buses come here). Dempsey Hill is so not that inaccessible after all.I am now a massive White Rabbit fan. *Hops*"

The chicken tikka entree was possibly the stand out for me. It was packed full of flavour, cooked perfectly, the chicken was tender and juicy - it was incredible. The curries were all amazing, but the standout for me was the rogan josh. I would also recommend getting the naan basket. It's got a lot of variety - butter naan, plain naan, roti, naan stuffed with cheese (that was heavenly) - it's great value and a good way to sample everything they offer. The service is fantastic - the owner of the store was there every time we came in, and was so friendly, attentive and accommodating. We would place an order with him and he would make suggestions which were always perfectly on point. The other staff were always attentive, promptly checking if we needed more drinks and if everything was okay. It really is an intimate little restaurant that has a very family-orientated feel to it.

But we were given someone else's food. We then had to flag down a waiter again, and explain that this isn't what we ordered. Only once again to not get our food for awhile. During this, the line of guests waiting to be seated grew to at least 10 people, and no one was there to greet them.The food was mediocre, overpriced, and not worth the view.I'd recommend going up to Fabre point to see the city and the forests, but pack a lunch, because there's no point in eating here."

This restaurant has floor to ceiling windows with excellent view of Sentosa and the islands.Spuds and Aprons serves an international menu but we decided to try the local dishes. Hokkien Noodle, Curry Chicken, and Singapore Laksa were delicious. Will recommend and come back again."

The decoration is very well done, with LED strips on the stairs, soft lighting in the roof, and a fake candle on each table. The restaurant is flexible to dietary requirements, but not all of them. The restaurant generally isn't too packed, and the atmosphere is great; quiet with good music playing in the background, and the air conditioning helps loads in the hot Singaporean heat. Also located next to the Bell or Happiness (look it up if you don't know what I'm talking about). The food was also pretty good quality for what we ordered. The Chilli Crab, whilst the chilli was mild, was ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING DELICIOUS! The chips were perfectly cooked, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The beer and wine was good, but the wine glass could be bigger, but the wine is extremely expensive, one tiny glass is worth a whole bottle. The chicken wings were greasy, but otherwise enjoyable. On our night, a group of four were dancing to the music, not sure why, but they were. The service is quick, and efficient, so I was happy about that. I'd definitely recommend this place for a good night out, but be prepped for some expensive items, and some reasonable prices items."

The salads were also good. However, the linguini and mushrooms wasn't too great. The big issue here was fast service on starters, but exceptionally slow service on salads and pastas."

Right outside of the entrance of the pedestrian bridge to the mrt. It opens early and many have breakfast here. My stomach is not localized enough yet to have anything else but fruit, bread and yoghurt for breakfast so I only visit this place for lunch. Where all the other places in ARC have their peak hour between 1215 and 1330, this place strangely enough is only packed after 1pm. Lot's of variety food from the local kitchen. I'm usually going for the seafood hor fun. The shrimps are a bit small but the veggies are fresh and crisp. Good value for money and local + definitely out performs it's closest competitor killeney."

Their roasted chicken is soft and succulent and even though it's roasted, the meat inside is juicy and we'll marinated. Their chicken rice brings me back in time to my childhood when chicken rice taste like this. The rice is not too oily and the chili is excellent, not too hot but refreshing on a hot humid afternoon. Highly recommended , but do come early, queues are now starting to form at their new premise."
