Chicken Rice,Comtech 60 Alexandra Terrace Singapore 118502 Singapore ,118502,,,[],Peter A.,OBFRSw7mTGtKJC89Qcai2w,"Singapore, Singapore",4,9/7/2012,"Chicken Rice is located next to the Resh Fruit stall at the entrance / exit of the Comtech foodcourt on level 1 / basement / same level as the carpark. Don't be fooled by the long queues, they move super fast. It's probably the fastest service you can experience at the Comtech Foodcourt. What I love most about this stall is that it is just decent chicken rice for $ 2,50. The portions of chicken are not to be complained about. The rice is full of chicken skin fat flavor. The spicy sauce is balanced and delicious. The dark sauce is as you expect it to be. The staff is very friendly. Good job guys, keep it up!"

The gravy is really lemak and is properly spicy, the way I like it. The claypot also adds a little extra oomph to the taste/overall laksa eating experience. The drawbacks are that the portion sizes are a bit small - I usually order medium - and they are a little stingy with ingredients. But maybe this is because I'm comparing the current standard to when the stall was still run by the father at the Depot Road location. I personally feel that the standard has dropped a bit since then. The other problem is that the parking is a little problematic at Bukit Merah as there are very few lots near the market. However, these are small complaints for me at the end of the day. I've still found myself coming back for more because this laksa really is that good."

That was before I discovered Zhen Shan Mei, which is located much nearer to where I live. I used to get my convenient fix of laksa sitting on the stools inside Queensway Shopping Centre, in between a casual stroll looking around for sporty stuff. Now, a five minute walk across to Alexandra Village brings me to one of the most 'sedap' bowls of laksa you'll find in Singapore.Some may not like it this way, but I adore this because it's so thick, rich and a fairly oily, so it not only leaves me quite full, but also satisfied to last till my next craving. It always feels good to eat out of a claypot, so there's that factor to this too, but I believe it's the way it's warmed in claypots that brings out that flavour in the soup. I wouldn't note this for its spiciness, because I don't recall having that big a sweat eating this, but even if you crave the chilli you will surely still enjoy this! Just ask for added chilli on the side, perhaps."

The food is as good as what you would find  at the better tapas bars in Spain, and as scrumptious as FOC even if the décor and ambience is much more homey. But foodies should not get their hopes too high, this is still a long way from the now-defunct Catalunya though, but again Catalunya was unique - its pool of talented chefs and bartenders could helm many top restaurants anywhere.

Having to look at instagram posts and menu, we noticed that they are popular for their black ink dishes. So we decided to order 黑 Rice, Black Sea, Crab Roll and Truffle fries to share.All of us love the 黑 Rice. From its presentation, decent proportion of the rice and the fried chicken as well as the egg. The rice tasted like Kampong Fried Rice with rich flavour. However, was quite confused as I didn't taste the black ink and it was just for the rice appearance. Overall, its a must order whenever anyone visit there, with the black ink taste or not. The crab roll was satisfactory as well. There was a lot of filling and the bun was crispy outside and soft inside, it was perfectly baked. The least favourite dish of the day was the Black Sea. Although I can taste the black ink in the pasta, however the seafood was undercooked as so it was tough to eat. The flavour was only decent and the portion size is very small. Truffle fries was great. Unlike most of the truffle fries out there, we can really smell and taste the truffle. In conclusion, the winner of the day is the 黑 Rice and I would gladly recommend it to my friends. While the crab roll was satisfactory, i think both the roll and black sea portion need to be improved as we are playing quite a lot for the dishes. At the end of the day I can only remember I was full because of the fries.Serving was good and the waitresses were attentive and full of smiles."

I think if everyone had been a little more on top of things, I'd be a much happier customer!We got 3 things to share:1. Cauliflower fritters - decent with a nice dipping sauce but was a little too over fried, I think the cauliflower would have done equally well roasted and would have been even better and healthier2. Black rice with steak - really loved the texture of the rice which was bouncy and chewy and delicious with the Japanese mayo and tobiko! The steak was surprisingly juicy and not overcooked.3. Buccatini with thick cut bacon - this was disappointing, the sauce had no flavor (squid ink) and the bacon was really salty. The bacon however, did balance out the pasta which had no flavor.

The Tonkatsu Ricotta, Salmon Dish, and Fish w/Potatoes were a few of my fav dishes. I am personally not a huge fan of potatoes but was very delighted to find theirs come in stringed shape, almost like noodles (see pic)Menu items I didn't like as much: - The Berry Hotcakes are also quite popular here, serving a generous portion of berries. The Hotcakes are very thick and filling however, and best for sharing among a group of 5-8 people (definitely not for one person). - The Pink Pasta was quite thick/creamy and small in portion size. I personally am not a huge fan of creamy pastas however so I may be biased here. - I also got to try the Garlic Fries as a side item, and found it to be the most mediocre item on the menu (among many exceptional items). Additional factors:- Location is a bit out of the way (need to taxi)- You pay the price. I went as a group of 3, ordering 3 mains, 1 side, and 2 coffees. The bill came out to $105 (and this was over lunch)!I definitely want to come back to try their other items. Overall a great ambiance with light wood, freshly roasted coffee, and friendly staff.

Buona Vista (nearer to Pasir Panjang) is this hipster cafe. There will be a row of shophouses and it is next to the intersection of Lorong Sarhad.Came here on a Monday around 1.30pm for my cousin's birthday party. Since my mother and I were the last one to arrive, some dishes are laid on the long dining table and we could taste some of the leftovers.Tried the risotto. Since it has been out for awhile before I arrive, the taste was not too great. We also tried the hot chick (fried ""popcorn"" chicken). Pretty well done as it was served after we arrived. The homemade chilli on the side did pair well with the chicken bites. The chicken skin was crunchy and the meat itself was juicy when served.My aunt then decided to order Kimchi Fried Rice for both my mother and I. We did not wait for long for it. When it arrived, it came in a bigger portion than expected (serves up to 2 or 3 pax). The lighting at the longest table was not that great hence I had to snap a quick photo before tasting the dish.For this dish, I love the steak slices. I ordered medium well and it turned out chewy and juicy to my likings. The kimchi portion for this dish was small. Would prefer it to be slightly more. The steaks definitely overpowered the flavors in the dish. For the rice, it was well-fried. The color of the fried rice were constant throughout the dish and the flavors linger in the mouth. Definitely one of the recommended dish here.I managed to try the ""famous and instagramable"" Berry Ricotta hotcakes. The berries were sweet and well-spread around the hotcakes.

(There was a long line when we left at 1pm). Ambience was great - we were seated at the bar so we could watch the baristas in action. Service was also prompt. The quinoa salmon was well-executed, with the quinoa providing a satisfying crunch. The salmon was moist and flavorful. Portion's not very big though. Was hoping to order the squid ink pasta but it wasn't on the menu anymore. Ordered the uni tagliatelle and wasn't disappointed. The prawn was fresh and the pasta creamy with uni. Highly recommended. Ordered the berry hotcake due to the rave reviews I've seen on social media. It came extremely prettily plated, and there was a good assortment of berries. The cake itself though, was slightly too dry for my liking, though spots of cream in the cake was a nice tough. The cake itself wasn't too sweet, which was good, but I wouldn't come here just for this. It's a slightly pricey place for brunch. The above 3 dishes + a latte came up to $70+, though on the whole one of my preferred cafes in Singapore."

The large windows, industrial-chic looking interior, differently textured walls of concrete, plywood and neon lighting already scream hipster before you enter. It's rather comfortable inside as you settle down and start looking at the menu. Some items are meant for sharing and the rest were noodle or yakitori dishes. I was very intrigued by the fusion dishes and proceeded to order the fried man tou sliders and toasted spicy rice cakes.Six fried man tou sliders arrived arranged on a large plate with two different sauces and a side of truffle fries. I was more impressed with the pork belly sliders than the lamb sliders, which I felt were too lean and dry. The korean rice cakes (Tteokbokki) arrived with a suitably crispy and slightly charred exterior with a spicy sauce mixed with a raw egg, salmon roe (ikura) and some pork slices. Although I enjoyed the juxtaposition of textures and flavors, the sauce was too salty for my liking.The coffee, however, is decently good. I saw the USD$21,000 Slayer(tm) machine sitting on the counter. I also think they get their beans from a local roaster. Earlier, I observed staff members at the bar fiddle with the Slayer(tm) espresso machine and attempt to coax it to deliver the right consistency of caffeine shot.Prices are much higher to compensate for not levying a service charge. I'm a little on the fence as the food is interesting but being a week old meant they still had a lot of kinks to iron out. Their wait staff were still rather new and confused on procedure, and the kitchen took a really long time (45 mins) to churn out the dishes before running out of food and closing early at 8:45pm. I saw a couple of angry (and hungry) customers exchanging words with the service staff. The repeated adjustment, tweaking and fiddling with the espresso machine also didn't give me much confidence.As I left, I'm reminded again of the good coffee as I saw the crate that the Slayer machine arrived in, displayed outside and used as a bench or table. Duck rice fans, you will have to head over to Little India. There's no duck on the menu here."

Methinks Paddy Hills would make a pretty worthwhile option if you're in the area, but I don't think the food was excellent enough to warrant travelling from afar.The bistro is run by a lean workforce, but, for a place that doesn't have any service charge, service was fantastic - smiley and efficient. Another perk, no GST either! That said, my grouse was mainly regarding the menu, it tended towards unnecessary and wasted pretense. If a menu requires Dr Google's assistance to make an informed decision, that's far too much posturing. I mean, how many regular people know what bagna cauda is? Or even how to pronounce it?! Also, a girlfriend took issue with the mispresentation on the menu. What was named 'Hash Hash' with a description of ""sauteed beef, mushroom, chorizo, doughstick and sous vide egg"" turned out to be a beef bak kut teh. Calling a dish ""hash"", she said, and I quite agree, implies that the whole jin-gang is sauteed, as you would a breakfast hash. A soupy bak kut teh IS NOT a hash. Strip away the pretense, I think, and re-direct the effort to the food. That's what draws in the crowds anyway.We had:1) Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($23) adorned with blueberry sugar, pinenuts, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, yuzu gel, and maple syrup: Very pretty, and it tasted as good as it looked. Thick, dense, but fluffy, these were the best pancakes I've had for as long as I can remember.2) Quesadillas ($20) stuffed with pulled duck and pickles, served with charred baby capsicum and sweet corn, and sided by a garlic aioli and guacamole: The quesadillas, in addition to being laced with parsley, were mediocre. My parsley-loving friend, who had this, said to give this a hard pass.3) Hash Hash ($24): Misleading description aside, this was a reasonably commendable and very comforting bowl of beef bak kut teh. Meltingly soft and wonderfully fatty, the luscious hunks of meat could have passed off as pork if I hadn't been informed otherwise. I particularly liked the western twist of the sous vide egg, arugula leaves, and chickpeas.4) Kimchi Fried Rice ($20): much touted, but turned out middling, even with the perfectly wobbly sous vide egg, and medium-well tender steak.

In any case, the service was bad to non-existent when we were there on a Friday night. My uncle booked a private room with 2 tables for a family dinner. There was a minimum spend required for a private room ($500 per table, so $1000 for 2 tables). After the staff took our orders, the service went downhill. We ordered fried rice and fried noodles first while waiting for the others as there were kids and we wanted to settle their rumbling stomachs first. It still took about 45 minutes for the fried rice to be served. And my cousin had to go find the ready dishes and it basically became a self service dinner. For most of the dishes, my cousin went out of the room and brought in the food, with the pegs and papers still attached to the plates. We had to repeat our request for warm water 3 to 5 times before it was served. I actually went out to help myself but was told by the server to wait and they would bring it in. But zilch. The service got a bit better towards the end (close to 9pm or after 9pm) as someone actually brought in the dishes. So maybe there was just not enough service staff to handle the dinner rush of 7pm - 9pm and so food was left cooling in the holding area. The food quality was ok, as what you would get in any of the Jumbo (or the others) outlets. The problem was with the lack of service. We paid at least $1000++ for a private room. You would think the service would be slightly better with at least a dedicated staff to the room. It is just appalling. Imagine if this is a business dinner and this happened. The private rooms are on the 2nd level and I am not sure if there are any elevators for those who have difficulties in climbing stairs. So 2 stars for this place even if the food is good."

Came here because my cousin had a coupon but the place was also quite delicious. The restaurant is a hybrid of 5 chefs from reputable restaurants that highlight each respective signature dishes.FRIED SMALL FISH: more of an appetizer than anything else.CHILLI CRAB: absolutely delicious. Does have a kick to it but still not too spicy that you don't want to eat it. The sauce is also perfect for dipping that perfectly warm and soft STEAMED BUNS.BLACK PEPPER CRAB: way too much pepper for my own taste. So much that I couldn't eat too much of it because I also ended up inhaling the black pepper and that was painful.FRIED PRAWNS WITH CEREAL: Prawns are sautéed with a special blend of oat cereal, curry leaves and fiery chilli padi. Also one of my favorites mainly because of the sweet oat cereal. DEEP FRIED SCALLOP WRAPPED IN YAM RING: Fresh whole scallop, embedded in soft yam paste, deep fried and served with traditional sweet ""Ngoh Hiang' sauce. This one was also a WINNER. The yam was soft and the ring was very crispy. The scallop also tasted very fresh.SERVICE: the service was ok. It could have been a lot better considering the atmosphere of the restaurant and the fact that there were not many customers. They took a while to take our orders and would forget to bring out certain dishes until we mentioned it to them.ENVIRONMENT: rather than nice ambiance since it's in the Sentosa area. There are multiple stories so just remember where you party is if you come separately. Inside the restaurant is bright with white seat covers. It feels fancy but not to the point you know you're breaking the bank (even though you are).Overall, I'm glad my cousin introduced us to this place. However, fortunately we had a couple otherwise it would have costed us a fortune. Though none the less a lot of things in Singapore are expensive. Despite the cost, I would still come back every now and then to eat some of this delicious food!"

Great place to hang out with friends and family. After your meal, try taking a 10-min walk by the sea to Vivo City, it's good for digestion. One negative comment though. I went there on a Wednesday's evening and they seem to be short of staff."

(Chef On Wheels) on several occasions, they seem to like popping up at the more artsy events that I attend - think Singapore Night Festival, Art After Dark @ Gillman Barracks etc. While I may have brushed past them at other events, it was finally at Gillman that I decided to take the plunge into my first affair with a food truck. I am wildly fascinated with food trucks and wish there were more of such in Singapore - unfortunately I guess there are permit and license issues aplenty and thus, we do not get to have food zooming around in trucks and straight to our (actually, mostly my) tummy! But then again, we have food at every MRT station, I guess food trucks wouldn't go well after the initial novel period for Singaporeans - we're an unfaithful bunch when it comes to food, cause there's too many things in Singapore to fall in love with already. My first brush with C.O.W. was a hit and a miss - mostly a hit though, but unfortunately Cupid didn't strike while the iron was hot as my Truffle Mac & Cheese Balls came half cold. I was yearning to bite down into an oozy, warm ball of yellow, cheesy goodness because the cup in my hand that held these scared balls was warm, hot even, to touch. But alas, my first bite was of cold, stale batter and a slight whiff of truffle on cold, stuck together pasta. The truffle monster in me roared as I was expecting a little more - its craving was not satisfied. The lady who handed my eager, excited being the food ask 'So how is it?' and in classic polite Singaporean-style, I told her it was yummy with a twinkle in my eyes. I had taken a bite and didn't want to send the food back to the kitchen. It was a rough night for them as the queues for food were long and I didn't want to be a mean person holding the line up. I had another two more balls of the same quality, and my last few balls at the bottom of the cup were slightly warmer, but still had the same stuck together, not really truffle-oil infused disappointment.The partner-in-crime (who had begrudgingly trudged his way to this godforsaken Gillman Barracks because he doesn't understand art but, #boyfduties) was rewarded for his valiant effort to pretend to understand all the abstract notions of art with an extremely yummy tasting Chilli Crab Pasta. At first look, there's nothing to fall in love with, it was a mess of sauce splayed over pasta - but the moment you get a whiff of it ... you see a bit of Singaporean heaven. I stole about 1/4 of the pasta that was supposed to be his dinner because it was so so yummy! The chilli crab sauce while not a vicious as the actual dish was seasoned and tasted perfectly like the real thing - put that with pasta, and I'm quite sold. Anyone who can cook half decent pasta in a truck deserves a pat on the back - and the sauce totally just makes you forget that the pasta ain't al dente. Overall, I came out of the experience a bit wary about loving it too much because of the Truffle Mac & Cheese Balls, but if their usual other dishes (like the Ramen Burger) that I want to try are more towards Chilli Crab Pasta standards, I think I'll become a loyal (event) patron of the Travelling C.O.W."

The Travelling C.O.W has come up with their version of the Ramen Burger, which consists of two golden crisp ramen patties and filled with some succulent meats, paired with a secret dressing. The Bulgogi Beef burger is a crowd pleaser, a mild sweet juicy burger. I liked the Spicy BBQ Chicken, which is more savory than spicy. The sauce provided the right amount of flavors for the otherwise bland noodle patty. More could be done to the consistency of the fried noodles, but when golden brown, it goes great with the saucy gravy. Skip the Mushroom Fricasse, instant mushroom noodles would have tasted better. Burgers are going for about $9. Be ready for a mess when eating the burger."

The staff are trained to provide prompt service and old and young alike are very pro-active.Our verdict:- Steamed village radish cake: this is the steam version of the fried carrot cake. It's a new dish on their Spring menu and I must say, it offers a different take on the traditional dim sum type of carrot cake. It's hard to describe it holistically but the picture says it all. Try this but note that the portion is quite huge if you're in a group of 2 so it may be best to cut down on other filling carbs if you wanna order this.- Prawn beancurd roll: the smell of this simply makes my mouth water. The portion is kinda small (3 pcs) for $7 but the taste is heavenly. The skin is fried to perfection and complements well with the inner fillings. This is my must-order dish on every visit.- Century egg and pork porridge: I never fail to order this dish every time I have dim sum but somehow this dish is a-ok; not too good not too bad. There are a few measly pieces of pork and century egg pieces but the texture of the porridge is faultless. Suggest to skip this dish if you have other interesting items to order on the menu.- Pan-fried juicy meat buns (3 pcs): another new item on the Spring menu and I gave up my order of Xiao Long Bao just because of the word 'juicy' and I thought it would be interesting to see how something juicy could be pan-fried! However, I was disappointed as it was anything but juicy. It's my expectations failing me! Other then it being not juicy as I expected, the buns were of a good size and the meat filling was quite flavourful. Why isn't it juicy?- Hot and Sour Dumplings (4 pcs): another dish that I absolutely love; the hotness and sourness is just right! A warning though, it may be a bit too spicy for those who are unable to take spicy food.I am already planning to return within the next two weeks and it's one of the places I would recommend to friends if they are craving for some Dim Sum within the Harbourfront area."

It's a good thing Tim Ho Wan has come to town and opened up a dozen or more stores to alleviate this reality. Enter Black Society Restaurant, formerly called Bosses Restaurant. This restaurant serves the high-quality dim sum that Hong Kong is so well known for. No none of that late night Dim Sum that we so often see in Geylang that are touted / raved by locals. I mean very very high quality Dim Sum.I tried 5 dim sum dishes, which were all downright amazing.(i) Prosperity Bag Shumai (Crowd favourite) - Your regular shumai that we all know and love, but with a lot more  pizzas(ii) Traditional Char Siu Bun - Your regular Char Siu Bun, but this was by far the best one I've tried in Singapore -- far tastier than one you would normally taste at street vendors or Uncle Dim Sum establishments(iii) Snow Mountain Black Pepper Beef Bun (Crowd Favourite) - In my opinion, very similiar to the Char Siu Bun with a nice white powdery touch. (iv) Prawn and Beancurd Skin Rice Roll ( Crowd Favourite) - Very crunchy and tasty. A must have to balance out any Dim Sum selection(v) Basket Steam Spare Ribs (Crowd Favourite) - Wow, wow, wow. I've never had spare ribs like that. The spare ribs had a little bit of kick, especially if you happen to bite into the chili In my opinion, five-stars because high-quality Dim Sum is such a rare find in Singapore.

Asked her to intro food after ordering a porridge, a fried rice, and two noodles. She said these should be enough for us. I then ordered the liu sha bao and the Xiao long bao as sides. The orders took a while to arrive and after eating everything, the fried rice never showed. Asked 2 waiters and still nothing, just told us to wait. So went to the lady at the counter and she just took my receipts and walked away. Few mins later she came back and from a distance away said very loudly that they are frying now. I responded just as loudly to cancel the order as the wait was too ridiculous. So food wise, someone said the prawn porridge is good, I disagree. It's very watery although the prawns are very fresh. The stir fry udon is cooked with vinegar, so taste like vinegar. The other Chinese noodles is cooked with sweet sauce, slightly better but taste sweet.

It did stood out to me. Thanks to Nayoung (one of the organizers for the babies showers), who made the reservation, we were able to sit in a big round table for 11 of us who were present that day. We were given the seats that has panoramic view of Sentosa. The sun rays directed to us and one of the attentive staffs asked me whether I would like to lower the blinds down as I was the first to arrive.After being ushered to the table, I headed to the restroom, located at the back of the restaurant. It was not as bright as I would like it to be and the toilets are pretty narrow and not much space to put our belongings. The one thing that fascinated me was not the mirrors towards the toilet but the sink. It was electronically sensored so you will have to use one hand to wave on the sensor while the water trickled down like waterfall. Service wise it was pretty inconsistent. Sometimes it might take awhile before the staffs come over to check on your needs.Food wise, one of my friends ordered.1) Har Gau (prawn dumpling) - was not warm enough. 2) Sweet corn pancake - did not taste it 3) Panfried radish cake with XO sauce - was alright 4) Prawn toast - highly recommended. The batter they use to get the dish made it crunchy and addictive 5) Crispy Mango Prawn Salad Roll with wasabi mayo - unfortunately I was not a fan of it even though it was Chinese fritters with prawn inside.6) Radish pancake - pretty good. It had quite a number of ingredients and made the dish to be collectively crunchy7) Prawn and beancurd skin rice roll - pretty interesting fusion dish. The beancurd skin was like those that are available for sushi. And flavor definitely popped out upon munching8) Signature custard lava bun - did not try it as it is a common dish at most restaurants that offer dim sum. (Took pretty long time before being served. Had to remind the staffs at least twice)Overall, food was alright.Prices wise it was considered reasonable especially located in one of the tourist must-go spots. Do check with the staff on the portion of the dishes.We were also served with the deep-fried fish skins and sesame with probably honey coated walnuts (if I didn't remember wrongly). Will probably try out their volcano black pepper bun and their signature custard buns during my next trip here.Thing to take note of that are chargeable here: wet napkins and glasses of water.

The restaurant is furnished in black, and possibly had its name inspired by the mafia in Hong Kong, commonly known as Hak Se Wui (literally translates to Black Society). You will not only find Cantonese items on the menu, you will also find some Shanghainese food items. In particular, the dim sum items are hot favorites as what is served at Bosses is probably more exquisite than what you commonly get outside. I highly recommend you to try the signature flowy custard buns, as well as the seafood congee (forgot the exact name of the dish). The ingredients used are fresh, and definitely very very tasty!What's more, it's got a pretty nice and relaxed atmosphere, contrary to its name. The staff are nice and attentive too, which gives the overall experience an A! The only downside is the cost. The things are slightly pricey, so be prepared to pay a little more.Worth it or not?

But if you are unwilling to beat that looooooooooooong queue at Plaza Singapure, may i suggest another comfortable alternative- Bosses at Vivocity.While it may not be 1 star quality, prices are affordable, location is convenient, ambience isn't too shady and the dim sum are generally quite consistent. I was first introduced to it by a girlfriend because the 30% discount at tea time seemed quite appealing to us. Available from Mon to Sat from  2.30pm to 5.30pm, this is a pretty good deal for what is usually priced at $4-6 per box of little bites. And we were not disappointed. I've eaten here a couple of times following that first visit and it satisfies this hungry tummy.    Appetizer of fried fish skin. I know it looks eeeky and all and i have always avoided this dish until my recent trip to Bosses. The auntie server convinced me that it's great with the sweet chili and well.. it didn't turn out as bad as i've imagined. It's just like keropok aka fish crackers. One of my usual orders at Bosses is their Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun or Liu Sha Bao. The skin of the steamed bun is soft and fluffy and the golden sauce inside was of the right level of saltiness and viscosity. There was also a light coconut perfume that i can never seem to place but anything goes as long as it's tasty. This is one of the better ones around in Singapore.Fat juicy and flavorful prawns in my Har Gow. I would like the prawns to be a little bouncier but i wouldn't say that the mix is too powdery. My twin's seafood/prawn craving was satisfied. The meat dumplings, Siew Mai, was also topped with pretty butterflied prawns. I love how the meat wasn't too minced up that they lose their chewiness. Very substantial unlike the regular steamed siew mais in lesser establishments. The meat was also well marinated and fragrant. If you happen to be shopping in Vivocity, Bosses is a good option for a late lunch or tea."

It isn't a traditional Chinese restaurant by any means and its decor informs you of just that when you walk in. The restaurant is washed in dark sleek tones, which is an uncommon yet modern choice.The wait staff are attentive and they check on your tea pot quite frequently, which is a sign of good service. We had a good view of the sea and further afield, Resorts World Sentosa and Universal Studios. If you are here for dinner, you might catch the nightly fireworks display, which is a bonus.Some highlights of our dinner were the aromatic crispy duck and the drunken prawns.

Personally I like the lightings, giving it an extra point to the ambience.They are famous for their salted custard bun, eat it immediately when served! But beware of the salted custard that ooze out from the bun, it is really hot. I am sure you will ask for more , one is just not enough to satisfy. Another dish I would recommend is their abalone porridge. The porridge is cooked with rich abalone taste, you will find that they do not scrimp on the ingredients.Price might be on a high side but it is definitely a good place to hold celebration for family occasions or for the elderly as their cuisine is oriental."

The theme of the meal was fall in Germany and it was packed with renditions of traditional and childhood foods he had growing up. the first course was serve in the wine cellar because it was warm and the cellar was a bit nippy. So many considerations went into this meal. I can't begin to articulate with any decency the quality and craftsmanship of this meal. Curate is a small space with not too many tables so here is enough room to breath and enough space for the servers and chef to come out and speak without being drowned out by noise. The décor was filled with copper and light and was extremely welcoming. All of the alcohol pairings were spot on and the service staff were excellent.

We initially ordered the green curry, grilled pork salad and stir fried kang kong. However, after seeing how tiny the portions were, my husband quickly added another order of basil minced pork.Green curry looked more yellow than green but it tasted pretty good. Kang kong was ok. It was fresh with the spicy kick. Grilled pork salad: I think the taste is altered to cater to the numerous expats living in the area. Typical Thai salads, or ""yum"", usually have strong sour and spicy taste. However the dish is rather mild (and also lacks the aromatic crushed rice bits).Minced pork and basil: I'm utterly disappointed with this dish. It doesn't look anything like a basil minced pork. It's more like the chef accidentally threw in an entire bottle of Chilli paste. Ironically, the dish doesn't come with much basil. I highly recommend that they change the name of this dish to stir fried minced pork with Chilli paste. The 4 items, 2 Thai ice teas, and 3 rice portions cost us 75 dollar. I don't remember it being so costly but I guess that's because it's been quite some time since I last came here. That said, it will be another long while before I come back here again. It's too painful to part with my money knowing that there are better and cheaper places to visit."

Then most of the time I get there, there is only a place outside for me to sit. Most people leave office around 12 for lunch in the neighboring offices, meaning they arrive there at 12:15-12:30, that's when the place start to get packed. For a reason though, because the food is just so good! E-sarn never fails to let me know if I grave for pad thai or green curry (although I don't really know what the figs are doing inside the curry and none of my collegues seem to eat them as well). They have a good set lunch menu for 7.90, see picture! Service is fast as well. The mango sticky rice with icecream on top is just heaven, but the same price as the set menu all together so take note. All together, great place to have lunch, but beat the crowd!"

If there's a picture of the King, it must be good (probably because it's manned by Real Thai People). This place has a big picture of the King (and the Queen), but it's the least good place I've found so far with a picture of Bhumibol. Not that the food is bad, but it isn't particularly good.This place is a rather no-frills joint, which you can tell from the laminated menus, which are battered and have the lamination peeling from them.The Tom Sapp (sic - Tom Sapp seems to be someone's name and the dish is called Tom Saap) was quite good, with a generous amount of ingredients, but was very very spicy. It was so spicy it made my lips sting.The Thai fish cake was truly freshly made and the freshness could be tasted, in contrast to places that do this frozen.Oriental fried rice was rather disappointing. It was rice fried with onion, frozen mixed vegetables, a middling amount of meat and a touch of ketchup. The taste was okay but not great and it lacked character.The honey chicken portion was a bit small, but I prefer smaller dishes since you get to try more things. It was thickly coated in a prawn paste batter (which seemed weird) and was well fried. Though it didn't have much honey it was tasty.The Thai iced tea was a disappointment because it was too dilute even at the start, even before all the ice melted.This place has no air conditioning, which combined with the spicy food seems designed to make you order more drinks. That said it was only $40 despite all the above, 2 Thai iced teas and a coconut.Though the food is good enough, E-Sarn across the road is better (though more expensive)."

The dough base was actually quite tasty, and cooked with a bit of charring so it can be crispy at some areas. It's thin enough to not become chewy, yet it's thick enough to not break or tear. They cook their pizzas in this large oven (although idk if it's gas or wood/charcoal fired) Overall the pizzas were flavourful, and the toppings were relatively substantial. They also have quite a variety of options, from veggie-only to pepperoni (duh), including ""pizza staples"" like Quad formaggi. Had the carbonara and squid ink pasta too, and the pasta is quite decent as well. Not soggy, and the pasta had some bite. The gravy on both occasions was quite thick and tasty too. Ambience:Relatively nice place to pamper yourself if you want to treat yourself to a decent meal. There's alfresco dining if you wish, and it's sheltered too. Music is not too loud yet discernible to enjoy (in case you ran out of conversations)Price:There's a $15 lunch set which is pretty worth it. Personal pizza/pasta + drink (green tea/coke) + salad (with vinaigrette dressing). However, be prepared to pay $20ish per person if ordering a la carte.

Lunch crowd - overwhelming. Lunch deal - very worth it. If in a rush, get the pasta not the pizza. When there are large groups, they tend to go for pizza and it takes a long time to get the big pizzas out. And in turn, small ones are slow too. You get 10% off when you order online for takeaway. Also you can personalize your drinks and salad for the lunch deal. Definitely get a large or extra large pizza because you can get two flavors on one. You can only match similar sauce based pizzas. My favorite pizzas here are the bacon Miele, salmone, frutti Di made, prosciutto arugula, pancetta (with the egg). The funghi is also really good for vegetarians. For pasta, I always go with linguine and carbonara. It is the cream sauced version but it is still satisfying. Just thicken the sauce by sprinkling endless amounts of cheese!!! Lemon tea house made is always my go to drink. Love it!! The beer however seems really watered down. There are good deals for jugs but the tastes seem rather off. Get the bottled beer if you want a good one. The managers are the only reliable ones at this branch. The lady behind the cashier/bar and the floor manager are great to go to. The other servers are typical Singaporean, oblivious. If you don't want to stink, sit al fresco. The music is also rather loud, but has a good selection of 80s mix."

Menu consists of classics from the heart of Tuscany to the Almafi coast. Pizza, pasta, fish, meat , and salads are all represented. The complimentary bruschetta was excellent. Instead of a thick slice of traditional baguette, they use more of a local crisped flat bread topped with seasoned chopped tomatoes and herbs. I could eat a whole plate myself. Their Frito misto is not one that will soon be forgotten. fresh and flavorful prawns, local fish, and calamari lightly fried. Accompanied by garlic aioli and a vibrant marinara sauce. Fantastic appetizer. Caprese was so much better than I was expecting because I haven't seen a decent tomato since I arrived in Singapore. This place is the exception. Deep red ripened tomatoes, soft mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil. Very enjoyable. For our main we shared a pizza Margherita. Expertly fired, thin Neapolitan style crust, simply topped with red sauce, mozzarella , and basil. Excellent desserts available, but we chose a liquid option to finish things off. Grappa Nonino and Amaro Montenegro rounded things off for us. Outstanding. Attentive servers, expansive outdoor seating, and excellent food make this a top choice for Italian fare in Singapore."

The best thing was the ribeye steak though with mushrooms and potatoes, which was extremely well seasoned and cooked and seemed like a lot of food. This is easily the best steak I have seen in Singapore at that price point. They also have gelato from Alfero, which is amazing. I will probably bring my family here when they visit.Service was a little avoidant but the food was good enough to make up for it. Only real shocker when the bill came was that the focaccia (pizza bianca) cost $12.80. It was really good and possibly worth it, but that is disproportionately expensive relative to the other items."

The restaurant was actually pretty empty but the atmosphere was still warm and cosy cos of the lighting and deco. We quickly ordered our mains and didn't had the time for any appetizers nor dessert due to the rush but we thoroughly enjoyed our mains!Upon our order, a complimentary appetizer was served. Dont really know what's in it but its on a slice of crispy bread and it tastes great. Our mains were fantastic too. I ordered seafood pasta and my friend, a beef baked pasta.

Maggi Goreng was great and very consistent with other good places.Friend ordered Mee Kuah (loose translation: Gravy Noodles) - he was curious as to what it was. Side-tracking: The Waiter look a little bit puzzled when we ordered Mee Kuah - asking twice ""Mee Kuah""? Made us worry a little, maybe no one orders it and they're out of ingredients. Took awhile too for them to bring the dish out but when they did - it was well worth the wait.Imagine the broth to taste like a liquid form of Sup Tulang (bone-marrow) - creamy, full of marrow flavour. Comes with generous chunks of Mutton - so tender and non-gamy. An egg was cracked just before serving, resulting in super-running egg-yolk.If they managed to achieve such tenderness in the Mee Kuah, the Mutton Soup ought to be equally good. So, ONE BOWL please! Yes - equally tender, super creamy, lots of herbs taste, non gamy too. You do however have to manually skim the oil from the top of the soup."
