I thought we were going to take the shuttle to the Heartland Mall (Kovan MRT station) to have lunch then go to this chocolate factory that the folks here keep mentioning but Sheng Teck took us to a new spot to eat, directly across from this chocolate factory. It was like all the other hawker centers I have been to but somewhat cleaner. As always, I find myself pondering what to eat every time because there are so many choices. Luckily, we found a table so I suggested for the 2 guys to grab their food first whilst I hold the table. Little did I know, I did not have to order any food for myself. As I was in line for some rice, roasted pork and char siu, Sheng Teck came up to me to tell me that he ordered enough food for him and I. Awwww, right? That guy literally stole my heart. + the rice was fluffy + portions are quite generous + the roasted pork was super tender + the BBQ pork was succulent + the roasted chicken melted in my mouth He also ordered something else for Jerry and I to try. I had no clue what it was but I tried it and feel like I deserve a medal for trying something I definitely was hesitant about, haha. The food was great. The best was my company. Both guys have a very special place in my heart. Thanks to this trip. I am so grateful. Thank you for treating, Sheng Teck :)"

The menu is filled with lots of hearty German fare, from sausages to schnitzel. We split a garlic sausage with sauerkraut and potato salad, and we were impressed! The sausage was juicy, and the sauerkraut complemented the creaminess of the potato salad.I was a little surprised that they didn't offer any soft pretzels as an option for appetizers; if they could do that I think it would make this place even better.

However the order was served with spaghetti by a apologetic staff saying they had no fettucini. Not too impressed with such poor service as they should ask customer first before preparing the meal. Too hungry to reject the order and wait for them to prepare something else so i took it  The mushrooms are not fresh mushroom but are instead canned button mushrooms. Beef is overcooked and tough. The sauce was salty but its expected cos its cheese.  I will stick to pies and pastries if i patronise them again the next time

I have to say my father has great taste (not only in finding a wife) - this is DA BEST fish-head steamboat in Singapore. Regardless of your choice of white pomfret or the red grouper, the pre-fried fish is always succulent and fresh, cooked to perfection in the full-flavoured soup. I remember as a kid I liked to select the half-soggy yam pieces from the soup, those were my favourite. The tofu prawn is a recommended side order. Its sauce is a different take with a little bit of spice, but it helps the rice to go down really well.Many people are willing to wait for these piping pots of steamy goodness, that's why we always make it a point to reach before dinner time.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews."

I have to say that that's pretty good for any country standards.Although the place says that it's a tapas bar, there is a fairly limited tapas menu, and not that exciting. But I have to say that the fried risotto is pretty fabulous. Their normal food menu, which are all full sized dishes, are all good. The pasta dishes are well cooked and are tasty. The pizza is a bit on the dry side, but good. This is really the place to come if you want to share a bottle of wine with your friends (or maybe just with yourself.)

So, look out for these offers if you're in an economical state of mind.

It has a really nice menu with decent food and wine at reasonable prices, which is a recipe for success in an area like Katong/Joo Chiat. It's flabbergasting how many other similar venues failed in this neighborhood because they didn't get the price/quality balance right, and Wine Connection has to be commended for not assuming that just because there's more expats living here, there's a market for European food at 30+ dollars a dish, and wine at 15+ dollars a glass.They do a lot of things right, from, again, reasonable prices for reasonable food and wine, to a pretty well done interior that gives the right ambiance, to - finally - reasonably late opening hours, something unheard of in this still pathetically early closing neighbourhood! Yes everyone else on east coast road and Joo Chiat, are you listening? If you want to ever become the Holland Village of the east, last order at 9:30 won't cut it.Now, to my biggest, and only issue with Wine Connection, which is a total deal breaker: the noise. This place is popular, and generally quite full, and the interior architect who was responsible for making this place look trendy-hip seems to have gone to great lengths to carefully choose materials that are sure to create the absolute maximum possible reverb, with everyone's voices bouncing off tiled floor, glass/concrete walls, making this place about as loud as the runway at Changi. Having dinner with spouse becomes an eternal 'say again' match, unless you're willing to join in with everyone else and scream your voice hoarse.Wine Connection would be an easy 4 star, but unless the noise is addressed - and it's not so hard, use fabric on the ceiling and it will be much better - it's a 3."

Giving it 4 stars for the following reasons:1. Food quality: They are well known for their tonkatsu sets and they don't disappoint. Their tonkatsu sets are delicious and one of the better ones that you can find in SG. Love their black and white sesame seeds which I always have fun grounding into powder form. Add some yuzu sauce to the grounded sesame and it becomes a perfect dip for the katsu, enhancing its taste tremendously. The tartar sauce that they serve is also really delicious and they will readily give you 2nd helpings if you ask for them.2. Free flow of shredded Cabbage: They are very generous with their shredded cabbage and the wait staff will come round to top up for you again and again. Gotta ask them to stop as one just cannot eat that much cabbage. The sesame and yuzu sauce go very well with the cabbage, making it a really refreshing side dish which helps to balance the taste of the meat dishes.3. Service: Service is friendly, adequate and pretty efficient. Probably a 3.5 stars for service overall.4. People Watching and Admiring Art in motion: The seats are comfortable, especially when you can get the booth seats. If you are seated at the booth seats, you can have a meal while enjoying the action - watching folks checking in at the airline counters at the departure hall below. I always try to get the booth seats and have been lucky to get them in all my past visits. It is also really fun to watch the very impressive art installation Kinetic Rain while dining here.Really into sake (especially hot sake) recently. So, would definitely be returning to Saboten to satisfy my cravings for hot sake and mouth-watering tonkatsu quite soon."

I ordered the pork loin on rice curry set. The panko on the pork and the pork itself were cooked really well. It was nice and crispy on the outside with a perfect color and the pork was nice and juicy and not at all oily. The curry was an average mild curry. I wish there was an option for a hot/spicy curry.

I headed down for dinner with the family and ordered more dishes to try.For starters, their ebi is still good at this branch. In fact, so good that my mum had seconds. I like that their prawns was melt in your mouth which adds a nice balance to the crispy batter. The tonkatsu was less than fantastic at this branch which is quite a shame since that was what I really raved about. The bits of oily skin inside which made it rather gross. I thought the one at Millenia Walk was done better with firmer meat to batter ratio and no skin in the cutlet. Tried the mentai cutlet, thought that was okay, nothing to write home about so stick to their original sets. The rice was fluffy and fragrant with fresh shredded cabbages that I love to pair with their sesame sauce. Icecream was the same though in a smaller scoop but that's no biggie. Service is just as polite but I just wished it was easier to get their attention since the service at Milennia Walk's branch was outstanding.

If you like it slightly wet, stocked in rich stock, this Hokkien Mee will work for you. I liked that they pair the yellow noodles with thin vermicelli (most places use thick vermicelli). You get more flavour and less starchy, plus the dish does not dry up as easily and you can enjoy the rich prawn broth with every bite! All the seafood added into the dish was cooked for the right bite so you don't have to worry about rubbery seafood.This is good even for takeaway, the Hokkien Mee stays wet from the rich broth."

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.A must dish is the local meal called ""Oluak"" aka oyster omelette from Green Sky food stall, which is one of the best you'll have in the whole of Singapore for my liking, which not only has generous servings of oysters but also their unique way of cooking it up and the textures are very different that the run of the mill ones, in that it's super crispy and crunchy.From the same stall, you can get a pretty good Char Kway Teow which is usually some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and although it wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.The usual satay store that we frequent was sold out by the time we arrived but the one we ate at Stall 11 Ayam Penyet (which translates to ""flat chicken"") didn't disappoint either and the mutton was full of flavour and and these segments of fat that were sweet and so more-ish. If you don't like fat, pass the satay stick on to someone that does. The sauce was nice too but like it's hard to find a bad pizza or bagel in New York, the same can be said for satay but be aware that there are many variations, depending upon the specific influences and regions grounding the chef.For dessert we had our traditional fare of Ais Kacang aka Ice Kacang and Cendol. Ice Kacang is basically shaved ice with flavourings of rose syrup and Gula Melaka (palm sugar) and the kacang part which is usually seaweed grass jelly and red beans and inevitably has attap chee or palm seeds and corn adorning the top. When you go to a beverage shop, they will usually serve hot and cold drinks as well as the refreshing ice kacang but it's almost like a Sizzler smorgasbord in that you can pick and choose what goes into your ice kacang. The cendol looks like little green worms but taste far from it and are sweet rice flour noodles coloured an iridescent green and often paired with coconut.Overall it has to be good if we keep going back there. There's definitely better Kway Teow for my tastes in town but the food stalls at Bedok Corner have yet to disappoint."

The Fried Prawn Mee is stewed in a rich stock, and holds a relatively strong taste of lard. Ye Lai Xiang, possibly the most famous stall there, occupies 2 stall spaces.

The brown sauce is not as spicy as I'd like it to be, but, good enough for that shiok factor. The crushed peanuts adds a good texture to this very satisfying dish. 2. Chicken rice at Tong Fong Fatt*I'm a Muslim so I have not eaten much authentic non-halal hainanese chicken rice*I've always preferred the hainanese chicken rice over the Malay chicken rice as the latter tends to be greasy with almost everything fried. This plate of chicken rice from TFF is amazing - rice is fragrant and fluffy, the steamed chicken is soft and succulent (you have a choice of roasted or steamed), the soup is alright and the garlic chilli adds a nice balance to the whole dish."

He was pouring huge pots of drinks while also taking peoples orders which was very mesmerizing and impressive. It wasn't all for show either because the teh was delicious! Actually, everything was good. We got the classics: curry noodles, nasi lemak and kaya toast. The two entrees also came with a slice of cake each so I got the Kaya and kopi flavors. The kaya one was my favorite!! Super thick buttercream and not too sweet. I came back again when flying out of the airport and tried their mee reebus which was also very tasty - it's like curry gravy.

You get a full bento out of a list of choices and especially if you're flying an LCC like. Scoot or Air Asia, the bento, with its diversity of delicious dishes, will sustain you for your upcoming flight and avoid you having to buy a crummy meal onboard.The tables are equipped with USB and AC power so the restaurant is essentially a pretty good lounge as well, with food being brought out to you and not people just randomly walking around you trying to get to a bar or buffet. Definitely check it out. It puts any other Priority Pass lounge to the background when it comes to food."

That's why when I'm traveling, I prefer to eat food that is as simple and as ""clean"" as possible. The Green Market, located on the 2nd floor of Terminal 2, fit the bill pretty well.4/5 Ambience: The restaurant has a modern Japanese design that'll have Instagram gals/guys going gaga. Eating there is also much more peaceful compared to the hubbub of the food court just down the hall.3.5/5 Food: My first time stopping by, I ordered the chicken donburi. It didn't taste anything remotely Japanese. It was more like a bland version of a Hong Kong chicken clay pot dish.My second time, I ordered the sashimi bento box and I liked that so much better. It came with 6 slices of sashimi, rice, miso soup, fruit, okra, and salad. Tbh, not the best sashimi I've had, but it was a simple and filling meal, so I left happy.4/5 Service: Multi-lingual servers who are attentive but not intrusive.Overall, definitely not the best Asian food I've ever had, but for airport food, it's not bad at all."
