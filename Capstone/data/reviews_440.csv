They are extremely well known for their chicken rice, which is a staple in Singapore!!!! The rice is so aromatic and has an amazing chicken flavour!!!! The chicken is cooked to perfection and is so tender that it almost melts in your mouth!!!! The soy sauce mixture that they pour on top of the chicken adds just the right amount of saltiness, which enhances the flavour by a lot!!!! Definitely try the fried tofu (which is so light and crispy), the fried fish and the hundred year old eggs!!!! You have to visit this place!!!"

BTK only does white chicken. I've never been a big fan of BTK. It is just a convenient place to bring visitors if they want to try hainanese chicken rice and do not need to sweat it out at a hawker centre.This experience is the same. The chicken is tender and moist but not exactly flavorful and it doesn't reach my definition of succulent. We tried their new vegetable dish of fried mushrooms with green veg. The fried mushrooms are too sweet as it is coated with honey. The coating is so sweet that you can't taste the mushrooms.Service was very attentive and courteous.FYI. They now give you two chargeable appetizers: peanuts ($1.50) and honey glazed pork ($3). So remember to say no if you do not want them.

Singaporeans are harsh when it comes to judging food but I guess with good right since they do know what's good on this island. However for me, being from NYC and now living in Singapore, this place was like 0_0 life changing! I swear I saw stars and the angels came down and started spoon feeding me this chicken rice! They ""say"" it gets even better than this, and I HAVE tried another place which they said was THE place to eat chicken rice, and was extremely disappointed. So for now, this is my #1 chicken rice place until I find another even better place. This place is near where I live so it was the closest good chicken rice nearby. What else can I say? Something that looks so unassuming, chicken, rice and kai lan, IS that good! We also ordered gizzard. So all that came to S$30. I guess your paying for a fancier kitchen and electricity for that aircon in this restaurant. P.S. ask for the grated ginger, if you don't ask, they don't deliver."

Typical of Teppanyaki serving standards you place your order, and then your food is prepared in front of you. It's interesting to watch how the chef arranges food on the hot plate according to cooking time, such that it is easy for him to swoop the,off the hot plate and serve. I loved their cheese okonomiyaki.Prices are affordable but, as with most Teppanyaki restaurants, it isn't baby- or toddler- friendly. While it may not be ideal for families or couples with babies. this means you can actually have a conversation over your meal without distractions. I love Japanese food in general and this place made me really happy. So far, it's the best Teppanyaki restaurant I've been to that's away from the bustling (and pricy) CBD."

There are 2 counters where you can watch the Teppanyaki chef in action. Normal table seating are also available. You can go with ala carte or set menu. Beef is good and come with a serving of bean sprouts. The sautéed mushrooms was also good. I've had better okonomiyaki although the serving is quite generous. Chawan mushi was served in an onion skin which was interesting

Fried chicken drumsticks - looks the lollipops because all the chicken meat was pushed up to the bone which made it easier to eat as well. - marinated very well :) it was crispy and flavorful.

From the many photos of local celebrities who have frequented this place, I was looking forward to the lobster porridge. The specialities listed on the wall were lobster porridge, Teochew cold crabs, Steve's chicken and HK steam fish. We opted to have the lobster porridge and chicken in order to try other zichar dishes. I rate this a 3 star for the lobster porridge as I feel Wan He Lou version tastes better. Maybe it's also because of the lobster used. Steve's chicken was pretty tasty. The other dishes we ordered were so so. Given it's so close to home, I wouldn't mind coming again whenever I crave lobster porridge if I didn't want to drive 30 min to Maude Road"

Their service and food is top notch and my all time favorite is the Parma and Arugula pizza. Generous portion of good Parma ham and good balance of arugula to even out the taste.

Very quiet yet filled with quite a bit of people. We were quickly brought to our seat and began ordering.The waiter, Laura, was very helpful in helping us choose food for the night. She told us about the specials that night and offered a few very delicious foods for us. In the end, we decided on Burrata Cheese with Pama Ham, rocket veggies and tomatoes. We also ordered a Parmiagiana crab meat pizza and a Vongole.The Burrata Cheese arrived in record time - about 5 minutes. The food would have taken at least 2 hours in other restaurants. The cheese was separate and had to be cut by a knife. The cheese sliced like butter. It was delicious! The Parma Ham was a great roll for the cheese too and the Rocket veggies and the tomatoes were just perfect. At just $40, I feel that although the food and price is reasonable, the cheese might be a little too much and maybe they can reduce the portion so we don't have to pack back home. Save the environment you know? Use less plastic right eh eh?The Vongole arrived as we finished the Burrata Cheese and boy was it good! The clams were superb and the noodles were excellently cooked and made. Just perfection. Enough said.Finally, the Parmiagiana arrived and boy was it fantastic! The cheese was chewy and delicious and every part of the pizza was bursting with flavor, leaving you craving for more. All I can say is: perfect... can't type anymore it's so good..........Overall, the meal was 'wunderbar!' And it was definitely worth the price of 160 in total which I think is quite reasonable considering the quality of the food. Will come again!!!!"

There is no bus going there, so it's Uber. The decorations are contemporary and consistent of well placed art pieces. This minimizes the distraction when you look inside to the covered open kitchen. You see the chef going about making pizza and other good Stuff.You wait outside while they get your table ready. We were there on a Sunday night without reservations. The restaurant was pretty full but we had our table quickly. The staff was smiling a lot and was friendly.We Ordered the standard stuff...Hawaiian pizza, spaghetti Bolognese & bacon fettuccine. The pizza had thin crust, with juicy pineapple and slices of ham. It was cooked, somewhat not too well as the middle was soggy. You cannot hold up the slices of pizza as it was soft and soggy. However there was sufficient ingredients on it.The Bolognese was made with finely minced meat, so fine that it formed into a meatless sauce. I am sure I felt the meat fibre between my teeth, so there was meat in it. Unfortunately the tomato sauce was too light so it tasted salty and not the tomato in the sauce.The bacon fettuccine was however good. There were pieces of mushroom, dried tomatoes and pieces of bacon in a white oily creamy sauce. It was very rich and tasted great. The noodle was done just soft enough and the sauce clink on to it.Dessert was the tiramisu and lava cake with gelato. The tiramisu was very good but lacked the usual alcohol. Guess it is a child friendly restaurant. The lava cake was moist and warm and goes well with the gelato. Given the distance and difficulty to get there, or if you have a car, to find a proper parking lot, it might not worth the effort. However if you around that area, it is a OK restaurant to go."

This was a little odd but it meant I got to try some other stuff. The soup wasn't bad. Unusually for pumpkin soup it had (pumpkin) seeds in it. The soup had a strong savory base; usually pumpkin soup is a little sweeter and thicker than this (and tastes more of pumpkin - the flavour was very settle here), but it was still decent. The garlic bread was usual Hainanese-style Western food garlic bread, i.e. edible.For appetisers we had chicken momo, which looked liked xiaolongbao. It tasted of South Asian spices though, and there was no juice flowing from inside. The chili it was served with was a little sour and slightly spicy; it didn't have any particular character, but then I'm not a fan of chili. This dish was so-so.We also had pork choila. It was served with lightly flavoured pilaf rice, and radish achar (pickles) which were near flavourless. The pork was cool (not even lukewarm) and slightly spicy, but had no particular character.The Nepalese roast chicken was better, though it was served with ""Western"" style vegetables. It was warm and tender (though not moist). The spice blend was tasty and it had a bit of en edge compared to generic roast chicken. The first taste was great but the flavour got boring after a while. Also the flavour clung to the surface and didn't penetrate the chicken well, so it was inconsistent. Nonetheless it was the best of the 3 dishes. Which probably explained why I saw 2 other people having it (while no one else was having the Nepalese menu).The set menu also came with coffee, tea or Milo. Yes, Milo.The cake that came with the set was normal - nothing unusual either way and par for the course for Singaporean-style Western food.I also had the apple pie for takeaway. It was quite mediocre, albeit eaten a few days later (which might've affected the flavour a little).The service was okay, cantankerous sign plastered everywhere notwithstanding. Oh, and despite the Mastercard-sponsored table reservation tokens, they don't accept credit cards.This place has no air-conditioning so it's just a cheap neighbourhood haunt which lets you try something exotic (the ketchup in squeeze bottles is another clue about the market positioning). Though I suspect you might be better off with the ""Western"" food."

We ordered: 1) Lamb Shank - I judge by whether the meat has funny smell and the texture of meat. It's beautifully grilled and tender to chew. Only pity there's not enough for me!! They plate 4 pieces on a home-made potato crust and seasonal vegetables. The vegetables were well marinated and sauté too. The potato crust thingie is a little weird for me. No like. But as a whole-SUPER LIKE! 2) Tenderloin - hubby loves meat so he order one steak with pepper sauce. Meat is generally tender so that's great. I asked him to compare to Aston's and he said that Aston's serving seemed to be bigger, taste-wise, about the same. 3) Grilled Chicken and fillet combo - I found the fish fresh and generous in serving. Chicken was ok too. Nothing spectacular but no bad. We only order one set so we had corn and potato soup to start. The soup was home-made and has bits of corn and potato in it. Very nice. Dessert was bread pudding and it was quite good too!!! As we stay in TP, very likely we'll pop by every now and then to try their other dishes."

When she found the tenderloin was not done to her liking, she called for the waiter. However the manager came over and accepted the complaint and brought the tenderloin back and did it again. This was the type of service which was not expected for the price we paid. And I love it that they have monthly specials. If you are ever there, give the Nepalese Chicken Salad. A little bit of spicy but it is a great opener to a potentially great meal."

When you arrive, choose your foodie from a range of selection from big touch screens that makes the food a tad bit more appetising. For steaks they even have the on-screen choices of rare, medium rare with pics depicting the state of the beef you chose plus the choice of sides and toppings. There are pretty wide selections of food for choices and not that expensive. I had a Grass-fed Ribeye Steak for $16.90 and my Wife had  a Grilled Salmon for $14.90. Okay, forgot to tell you to get ready to be seated but from the tablet printer, out comes your queue number after you have confirmed your order and you hand it to their friendly staffs and they seat you.Back to the food! The Ribeye was done the way I would expect the Steak to be served. Juicy tender red meat melted in my mouth with just a little resistance. Accompanied by mash potato and salad with honey mustard, think I found a partner. My way. The serving for the Grilled Salmon was good and it was grilled just nicely. Wasn't fishy and come with a good serving size of fries.

On the base floor of each highrise will be an open air food court. Essentially nobody cooks above in their condos. They just go down to the ground floor and order. Talk about convenience. Not unusual to find a multi-generational family operated restaurant(s). Our friend Sonny has been eating @Hong Sheng since he was a youngster. Our order taker reminded Sonny that she hadn't seen him lately. He could only smile. The predominant language spoken here is Cantonese and so is the cuisine. A nice change from the hawker food centers. Unlike in America, the portions here are much smaller as in individual size. However, it allows for more variety when ordering.

I heard the steak is really delicious too. The prices are very affordable but the food is high quality. You can feel the effort put in by the chef to prepare each dish and the quality + presentation of the food is 5 star!

For my foreigner friends, ""teochew"" is a Chinese dialect.My family has dined here on several occasions and most recently 2 weeks back, we felt the quality and taste were generally good with some hits and misses. But based on our visit yesterday, we realized that food quality consistency wasn't there. Service was also not that great. First ups, we had already pre-reserved 2 cold crabs for dad's dinner, but was told that they didn't have stock this week. I think this is bad customer service, they had ample time to call me and inform me but didn't do so. And they weren't apologetic over it at all! Being dad's birthday, I didn't want to kick up a fuss. But this is major!! We then decided to replace it with crayfish. Here's what we ordered:1. Longevity buns - ok2. Cold dish - good3. Pork ribs king - good 4. Sliced beef with spring onion - bad - the version we ate 2 wks ago was tender and succulent but yesterday's were tough and starchy 5. Kai lan - ok 6. Crayfish - not great - Sambal sauce was a tad salty and it felt that the salt wasn't evenly distributed 7. Winter melon chicken soup - good8. Teochew style steamed pomfret - good9. Efu noodles - no good - bland with only 1 sliced black mushroom on the plate - huh?!?9. Dessert was Orh-nee or ""steamed yam with pumpkin and ginkgo nuts"" - ok We didn't order teochew braised duck or fish maw with sea cucumber because it wasn't that great 2 weeks ago. Overall, I think it could be a situation where the main chef was on medical leave and someone else took over, or he was having a bad day. Whatever it is, if it's a special occasion family dinner you dine at your own risk. If it's a normal family dinner, it's fine."

However, the first few mouth were too overwhelming for me. The chicken is covered with lots of cornflakes. It's too oily for my palate. The sweet smelling aroma that ended with a bad taste in the mouth got me even more disappointed. Waffle at Prima deli is even way more delicious than this.The seafood baked rice picture on the menu has salmon in it. We were deceived by it. When it came, it was practically baked rice with a few of mussels. And it tasted better with Tabasco.Even the only presentable decent one was the chicken katsu rice. Even then the rice is not fragrant for that price that we pay for.Try it for yourself and be your own judge. I have a high benchmark for food so I am definitely not going to come here for a meal.

They also took about 20mins to finally prepare our drinks comprising of 1 barley water and 3 teas.Food was disgusting especially in the case of the noodles where it was inedible and very salty. The bowl of noodles given to us had sat on their countertop for long before being served to us cold. Absolutely incorrigible and unacceptable!

I mean Authentic Taiwan Cuisine is the name of the restaurant when you check in on Foursquare so there. More specifically though, the restaurant does authentic Taiwanese home-cooking. This tiny eatery has a homey feel to it  - it's like you're in someone's living room with the lady proprietress taking your orders and the one cook in the back whipping out homestyle dishes. We ordered an eggplant stew, a spicy caramelized catfish dish, and their three cup chicken. Flavors overall were nice and went well with rice or porridge. If you had to nit, the way the chicken was butchered resulted in little chards of bone that you had to pick through. The catfish had many tiny bones too so be careful. I think it's all indicative of home cooking versus a restaurant. Little details matter but the food is decent and worth a try. For bringing something different to the neighborhood, Authentic Taiwan Cuisine is a cool addition. They have special bentos too that are only available during lunch if you would like to try the restaurant then."

It was a very small eatery that can only accommodate 4 small table and 3 tables outside the shop. We were told that we have to finish eating and leave within 1.5hrs. We had no choice since we already purchased the voucher. We were served by a lady server and as we ordered a couple of dishes for 4 person, she said very loudly that we should not order so many dishes because her paper could not accommodate. We only ordered about 8 dishes. I believe she is also the owner of the restaurant.When the dishes came, we were surprised that the plate size was very small and there was only 3 pcs of items on each dish. Since we had 4 people, we had to share.Since we have finished our food and we wanted to order more, the server tried to ignore us. She shouted that she was very busy.Finally she came and as we made our orders. Again she spoke loudly asking why are we ordering some repeated dishes. We had to explained that it wasn't enough for 4 of us and she asked 'enough orders!' We only ordered another 4 dishes.When the dishes came, she just threw it on the table. Wow!As I was eating, I noticed another 6 people came and sat beside our table. One of the patron, wanted to order and again very loudly the server told them that they had to finish their food with 1.5hrs. There was a slight argument. The patron was rather upset and all the 6 customers left without eating. I would expected great if not excellent service from a Taiwanese restaurant since I have been to Taiwan a few time. But I was really surprised at this restaurant. In this time and economy, most restaurants around Singapore are dieing for customers and you get this kind of service.In the end we left the restaurant feeling very stressful, upset and still hungry. I wouldn't recommend anyone visiting this restaurant unless you don't mind their atrocious service."

Similarly, we purchased voucher from deal.sg and went there on a sunday afternoon.Took us quite a while to locate the restaurant as it is at a tiny corner beside a food court...When we entered, there were another table of around 8 ppl and we were asked to sit near them, which usually we customers should have the right to choose where we wanna seat given there aren't anyone else there.The old lady, believed to be the owner, very impatiently told us that we can only eat for 1.5hrs, which is never written on the deal.sg page, somemore,according to her, seafood & dessert is only 1 serving per person & cannot order 2nd serving. She also told us that wastage of food is charged @$10++Fine, so we took a look at the menu, the only ""seafood"" is actually just Saba fish, so we ordered 1 and the Saba served was more or less like a burnt piece of wood..Luckily we didn't order 2...We also ordered 1 Dong Po Meat, which is too oily & I almost couldn't finish it...Other dishes we also tried quite a few, cuz the portion was really really very tiny, imagine those sushi plate used in Sakae, their dish is served in those kind of plates..Nothing spectacular, mostly not to my expectation of good Taiwanese food.Tea was indeed free-flow, but just the teapot used looks like it had not been washed for long, you can see tea stains & dunno what liquid inside, which is like ehm...= =We asked the old lady if she could change another teapot for us & she just open the cap & emptied the teapot & returned to us...We had to wash the teapot ourselves, using the tea from them...Horrible...Lastly, about the dessert, just 1 tiny scoop of icecream, no, not the scoop that you have when you go Gelato, more like the size of a Ping-Pong ball or smaller actually...Me & my friend finished in about 10 seconds...After all, the worst thing need to highlight being the old lady always have that kind of ""hey you all owe me money you know"" look on her face throughout our dining time which made us feel really bad...Not recommended..."

Big mistake! The place is pretty small and is filled with customers who purchased the same vouchers from Deal.Com. It took a while before anyone notice us. We were given a round table and in a typical loud Taiwanese tone, we were told that they are very packed and fully booked for the day, hence we only have 1.5 hour for our lunch before we clear the table for the next round. Fair enough. We proceeded with the ordering. Not knowing the portion, we tentatively ordered a few items just to try out. On the menu, some side dishes are listed under the header of ""Self Service"" and since there is a counter by the side with the stated side dishes, we assumed that we are supposed to go get those items ourselves. However, when we were trying to help ourselves, a male staff told us impatiently that we just need to place the order and the items will be served to us. Quite contradicting. After first round of ordering, we waited for around 15 minutes before the dishes started arriving. Most of the dishes (Bean Paste Noodle, Tian Bu Lah, Fried Salted Chicken, Ma Pu Duo Fo, etc)  are so so in taste and not fantastic in appearance. Though, I have to say that items like the Double Sausage Rolls is pretty ok. We waited some more for the rest of our dishes to arrive... but it never happens. Hence we decided to proceed with the second round of ordering. After waving our hands wildly to get the attention of the serving crews, and waiting for yet some more, finally the same male staff attended to us. We placed our order and then proceeded to wait. After waiting for close to 20 minutes, still nothing is served. That is when we tried our best to get the attention of the serving crews. However, all 3 of them seemed so busy and never see our hands all waving into the air to get their attention. Left with no choice, we have to wait again. We waited for another estimated 10 minutes before we also raise the white flag and left without being served the outstanding items from the first order and any items from the second order. Conclusion: While I understand the need to restrict the customers' lunch duration to 1.5 hours in view of the crowd generated from the sales of vouchers from Deal.Com,  it is not acceptable if out of the 1.5 hours duration, at least an hour is spent waiting. I estimated our actual eating time to be less than 20 minutes. There are probably about 4 to 5  tables inside the eating place and another 3 to 4 tables outside. And all the customers are using vouchers, meaning, they have to call up for reservation first. It is ridiculous that the serving crews are unable to manage such a low capacity, especially when the workload can be predicted from the reservations received. And if weekday lunch vouchers are purchased, the customers likely will have limited lunch time and would have to get back to work pretty soon. I cannot help but think that they are playing delaying tactics so that customers like myself and my colleagues who need to go back to work have no choice but to leave even though we have barely consume anything. In addition, some of the items that we ordered do not even need much preparation. Like the Stew Minced Meat Rice, there is a rice cooker at the side counter filled with rice and a slow cooker beside it filled with the stew minced meat. How difficult is it to just scoop some rice on a bowl and pour some stew minced meat over it to serve? Will definitely not return back to this place again even if it is FOC and will not recommend to anyone."

For the adventurous, there's ice cream flavours such as Wasabi and Nacho Cheese! Both of which, really tasted like the name of the ice cream!Aglio Seafood and Vongole $16.9First up, their signature dish, made with fresh Tiger prawns, squid, vongole, seafood broth, cooked in a classic Aglio Olio style. Clarence explained that the type of seafood used in this dish varies, as per fresh seafood supplies.Some weeks, he can get fresh Tiger prawns from the straits of Melaka, sometimes, if it's a Malaysian holiday, the fishermen take the days off and he is unable to get that some seafood. However, you are still guaranteed fresh seafood in your dish, as the owners of Grazie will still source for other seafood to substitute. Clarence also shared that he likes big squid rings in his dishes, and hence the sizeable chunk of yummy squid are evident in the dish.2. Chicken Ballotine $15.90Chicken thigh wrapped with minced pork and spinach, served with cranbeery sauce, purple cabbage and home made potato mash. The mash was rather addictive, though served cold, made the dish rather flavourful. This was my first time having a ballotine and I did like the sweet cranberry sauce, it reminded me of a certain swedish furniture brand's meatball sauce. The meat however tasted a bit bland for my liking.3. Mushroom soup $6.90Check out the pastry baked upon the soup. Light brown and crisp in texture, covering the mushroom soup. The mushroom soup is also made from scratch using white button mushrooms and shitake mushrooms. The soup was more of a mushroom puree than a mushroom soup, lots of chunks of mushrooms could be seen in dish. I really liked the heart-warming taste to this soup and would definintely be back to try their Pumpkin soup $6.90 too!~4.  Speculoos Latte Iced $6.50Served with whipped cream and oreo crumbs, this was a nice drink to cool off the hot weather, despite only having walked less than a hundred metres from the car park. Pictured here is cold Yuzu brewed tea $6, a very interesting concoction I must say. A refreshing drink if you're feeling heaty.5. Yin Yang Waffles with ice creamIf you can't decide what waffles to get, buttermilk or charcoal, how about getting both? Served with Grazie's in-house made chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Both ice creams had different textures. The chocolate was abit more coarse and sweeter, whereas the vanilla was milkier and not as sweet, together they went really well with the crispy waffles. For crispy waffle lovers, take note the waffles here are totally your thing!They also have other ice cream flavours like Cranberry,  Thai Iced Tea and Caramel.Overall : Grazie has moved up from their humble hawker location to a nice location in Whampoa West. Their menu has significantly grown in variety to offer desserts, drinks and more. The owners are very passionate about food and they take pride in serving the freshest ingredients in every dish. Definitely try their pastas and waffles!There's a opening promotion of 10% discount till end of September 2017"

So you place your order and the queue number is written at the top. Go to the pick up area and wait for your number to be flashed on the board. If there is more than 10 or 15 digit gap, go outside and walk around. The chicken is nice but I think the one at the original hawker stall in Chinatown food center is better. The white meat is not as tender here. Same for the char siew and sio bak. I like the noodle and the sauce though. For just under $5 a plate, this is better quality food and value than those served at generic food courts or coffee shops. I will still come here as it is near home and parking is easy.

Boy was I shocked at the huge quantity of noodles and wondered if I were able to finish it. After the first bite.. the chewiness, the sauce, the chilli paste, the green chillies I added... oh so many emotions. I may be exaggerating slightly, but it ain't totally.The noodles were chewy, and not disappointing. It soaks up and pairs with the soya sauce pretty well. The sauce is a little sweet and very flavourful. Noodles paired well also with the refreshingly cold green chillies. Next surprise: the chillies they gave. It's not spicy as I thought it would; in fact it was very mild, but there is a ever-so-slight prawn paste taste to it. I love it! Soya sauce chicken was tasty and the chicken is not like fantabulous so keep your expectations around there. Although its one michelin star, its hawker food for the masses after all. Chicken's soft enough for me and I quite enjoyed it. I just wish there were lesser bones. Some people said that the one in Smith Street is better; I hope to try that out someday. For now, this brings soya sauce chicken to a consistently good level.  Seriously impressed!"

Keep in mind you still have to order first and then find a table. Best tip is to divide and conquer especially if you have a big group. One person wait in line while others find and reserve a seat because that is how it works. Order the chicken and pork and you won't regret it. Use the tray they give you NO matter what you think you can handle. The sauce can spill easily so don't risk it. They do accept credit card and enjoy your meal.

Encountering a line outside the restaurant, we only waited 10 to 15 more minutes until we were ushered inside to order. You can use the self ordering kiosk or order at the counter.Then you try to get a table. It is communal dining. You wait for your order number to appear so you can get your food.A limited menu basically featuring chicken and pork cooked in a soy sauce sauce. You can get it with either rice or noodles.We ordered one of each. Both were very good, moist and tendered.And the cost was unreal. The 2 dishes and a Tiger beer. were $ 15 Singapore dollars and around $ 9 US Dollars."

My husband and I decided to pay this a visit.Located in 18 tai seng, this place really gets crowded during the lunch hour. Avoid at all cost. Wait times could be 30mins, at least we waited that long for our order to be ready.So, we got our order, everything looks glistening. First note, it was oily. A lot of oil swirling around my noodle and our bean sprouts. My soy sauce chicken hor fun was good, but I didn't think it was better than others of the same. The chicken was smooth and tender, so are some that I've tasted elsewhere. The bean sprouts were crunchy but it was not any different from other stalls who also serve this. We also ordered a side of char siew & siew yok, I felt the siew yok was so tender that it had not texture. Could've been better if there was some bite.Overall, I don't think it was any better than other soy sauce chicken dish. I hold my praises for this."
