Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really bad about this place, but it's not quite value for money as the set brunches are rather costly at around S$26 for coffee, juice and eggs benedict. The portions were on the small side and while the eggs were done right, the sauce was pretty much average. The coffee also really wasn't up to scratch. Final price for 2 people with tax was around $60.The interior was done to evoke the interior of a french cottage. Maybe it's just me, but the french folk music and accordion were getting on my nerves before the one hour mark. It was just too touristy and cliched. My idea of french music is two guys wearing LED helmets before getting on stage and hitting the decks...It's okay, but there are other better places to get your brunch fix."

I find every reason a good reason to go brunching....and I think Choupinette is awesome!Reasons for giving it four stars:- Their eggs benedict are consistently good. The poached eggs is one of the better I has in Singapore so far.- Despite what previous reviews said, I like the service and good service is rare in Singapore: they are always super friendly and chatty. I must admit they sometimes forget things but they are always apologetic which I find more important.- They are located walking distance from my home (ok, I realize that this is probably not applicable for most other people so not a real argument but it counts for me, ok?)Reasons for not giving it five stars:- It is not cheap, but I don't think it is overpriced either. You pay 25++ for eggs benedict, a coffee of your choice and a juice. Other places in Singapore charge similar prices though.- The juices are not fresh, they are long life juices but I like that they offer a big selection.- They do not serve cocktails and I think a brunch is not complete without a bloody mary or a mimosa but I guess that is aligned with their French concept, however eggs benedict is not really a French dish either.This is one of the cases where I wish there was the possibility to give a half star, I would definitely give Choupinette four and a half stars!Would I go back? Yes, already have been several times! Recommended!"

Based on the reviews, they probably are consistent with this. I can't say much until my next visit (if I do go back).One reason that will make me think twice before going back is the price. It is a little bit too steep compared to other places that serve similar items.  My husband couldn't get over the fact that we need to order the 'set meal' that comes with a juice (not freshly squeezed) and tea/coffee. The set costs about $26- and if i remember correctly, it's before GST and service. The wait staff also forgot to bring us the juice so we ended up gulping some down before we left the place.

I thus ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benny while my eating mate got the regular eggs Benny. Hers were slightly better; while mine were average as far as eggs Benny go. I had a few issues with this place though; for one, the dishes are massively over-priced. In terms of value for money, you are better off going virtually anywhere else for this meal. We paid $56 for the two brunch sets. They come with a juice and either coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. I got lime and my friend got orange. Her's tasted suspiciously of the minute maid variety while my juice was terribly bitter.They also brought out our hot chocolate at the exact time as our juice so it got cold. The eggs Benny are regular sized portions, but for $26 I expect the whole nine yards. We had to ask for more hollandaise sauce, and I was unimpressed by the amount of meat they served to my friend. The seating is rather cramped, but the setting is still quaint. I liked the atmosphere but it certainly did not make up for the feeling of paying an arm and leg for only slightly above average fare.

The interior of the place is furnished in a homely, cozy fashion; a nice alternative to the unanimity of modern 'minimalist' cafes. The menu is not extensive, but the food all taste pretty good. Having tried almost everything, my favorite still has to be the Eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine. Unless you catch them on a super busy/off day (hardly), you should be able to expect nicely poached eggs, well seasoned salmon and wonderfully light, silky, buttery hollandaise sauce. If you wish to opt for something light, they also serve the fluffiest, flaky and flavorful croissants that go extremely well with tea or coffee.But as with most things in the area, the food is pricey.

After taking a quick trip to the ATM around the corner (cash only), we ordered xiao long bao, pan-fried buns, chicken mushroom noodles, sauteed pea shoots, and pan-fried dumplings. Everything was phenomenal! Our favorites were definitely the xiao long bao and buns. The flavor of the meat is just right and absolutely mouth-watering, and the soup is a perfectly spiced complement. The buns were fluffy with a perfectly crisped, not-greasy bottom and completed by the juicy and savory filling. At home, we eat at Din Tai Fung pretty regularly, and this was way better!

It's heaven on earth! I can't believe that I haven't tried this place until today. The restaurant is managed by a husband and wife team. The wife sources the ingredients and personally flies to China to get the best things there. She's very passionate and believes that people should only have healthy and good food. She also doesn't take any short cut. There are some ingredient that you can get easily from the factories, but she refuses to do that. I think I can go on and on about their cooking philosophy. Let's just say, you need to try the food yourself. Xiao Long Bao- very powerful soup. No need extra sauce or ginger. Hand made noodle- the texture is amazing. The best I have tried. Pork buns- she flies to China to source for the best salted veggie used in this item. The sauce, bun, and pork can send you to heaven. The veggie- I was initially skeptical about this dish. How can a super green simple dish be so good. I'm so used to having veggies cooked with garlic or chillis. But, this simple dish blew me away. It was delicious.

However if you think you can fill up your tummy, then you'll have to order lots of dishes. This is because all dishes are small. The steam dumplings are only 5 to a basket. So for 2 persons, you'll need to get 2 baskets. We also ordered the fried buns which are very delicious, together with Shanghai wanton soup, braised pork noodles. The prices are reasonable but the stir-fried dou Miao is rather pricey at $12 for a small plate. Both of us paid $44 for 4 dishes and tea. A rather reasonable deal."

The place is small, so call ahead to reserve if you've a big group of diners. And if you have a big group, order everything on the menu in multiples because the portions are small too. The cooking here is quite refined although the menu is small and prices are reasonable. I'd recommend the xiaolongbao, the shen jian bao and the shanghai spring rolls. The xiaolongbao has a lovely sweet soup and the skin is delicate enough to not result in a doughy knot at the top but strong enough to withstand a chopstick grip from basket to plate. The shen jian bao has a tasty meat filling but it is the crunchy bottom, covered in a layer of nutty seeds, that makes this a win. The Shanghai spring rolls are deep fried a la minute, and comes to the table atomically crispy, with skins that shatter satisfyingly with each bite. The filling is shredded cabbage instead of the local turnip version. The drunken chicken is very fragrant with the wine and silky in texture. Also good is the braised pork belly with sweet mei cai, unctuous and melt in your mouth. As for the vegetable options, the french beans are crisp and surprisingly spicy. But for me, it is a photo finish between the wild rice stems and the chives in egg. This is the only place where I've ever seen wild rice stems - they taste like a more delicate version of lily buds. The chives are cooked in a creamy scrambled egg and superb. There are two dessert options but I'd advise a miss. Expend your calories on the main dishes as they are the star of the show and really worthwhile. The only quibbles I have with this place is that it can get really noisy as it is small and full of hard surfaces that bounce sound around. And the chef-owner can sometimes be a tad temperamental. Do not make the mistake of asking for vinegar and ginger with your xiaolongbao because he will lecture you on how that is the crutch of restaurants who do not know how to make a flavourful xiaolongbao. I've seen him do that to other hapless diners before. So be warned!"

Of course the si ji dou and zui ji (drunken chicken) are other authentic shanghainese dishes that are not to be missed.Cos the restaurant is a very small set up, walk-ins may find it hard to get a table during peak dinner time so it's always better to just call and make a reservation.

Perhaps a little pricey at $7 but worth the occasional treat. It's a light and flaky pastry with a rich, sweet, and savory salted egg filling that is so unctuous. It's yummy. Note: they do sell out of these so come early. I've also had the Dirty Norwegian croissant which is great for a brunch entree. It's the same flaky croissant with smoked salmon, poached eggs, with the same salted egg yolk sauce plus buttered cereal. It's everything great about the salted egg yolk croissant and then leveled up for brunch. Also served with a side salad that I appreciated and chicken sausages that I thought was extraneous and distracting. Great casual spot for brunch."

I must say being newish to Singapore Yelp has helped me a lot so I wanna give back to the community with a little gem I discovered myself. I am Aussie Vietnamese working in Singapore. I am a bit of a Vietnamese food snob as I grew up with an abundance of good Vietnamese food and have been to Vietnam recently.Considering the number of Vietnamese migrants in Singapore the Vietnamese food can be hit and miss. I generally stay away from the franchises. My favourite is Mrs Pho (Bugis) and everyone on Yelp keeps saying good things about Orchard Towers place (yet to experience). Anyway I have been to Hong Trang Nguyen twice now. First was a test lunch with pho bo (beef noodle soup) and goi xoai (green mango salad). Simple flavours yet clean and fresh. Perfect. (I won't explain the specifics of these dishes because this review is really for people who are familiar with Vietnamese food. If not just go try the meal is only $4!)So I decided to take my uncle and aunty (my land lords from Singapore) to try the Hu Tieu tonight. Again, broth was simple yet fresh and a familiar taste to home (in Australia) and Vietnam. We also ordered the goi cuon which is nice but they are using a Chinese style pre packed pork I suspect. We also got the cha gio (deep fried spring rolls). This was quite disappointing and poorly wrapped, which made them very oily (a well wrapped spring roll is not that oily). Aunty also got the rau muong xao toi (stir fried morning glory and garlic). Nothing too special. Quite oily and usually a dish served as a side with rice. Again I ordered the goi xoai which was consistently good (better than the one I had in Joo Chiat). My General Vietnamese food tips:-if the aunty speaks Vietnamese it's probably good- stay away from franchises: expensive and their quality control is operated by a corporation so always disappointing- if the beef noodle soup is good I'll come back-stay away from the banh mi bread in Singapore , you will be disappointed. No one here makes good banh mi here. I won't even try the one at Hong Trang Nguyen cos I can tell it's not legitMy tips for Hong Trang Nguyen-Aunty says they have only been opened for one month, so I suspect they can only get better.-when it's busy be prepared to wait they haven't quite perfected their prep chain yet-go for the pho bo beef noodle soup or any other noodle soup. This is their specialty. I haven't tried their special combo yet as I'm a pho tai purist. -goi xoai mango salad is a nice side dish-anyone on the NE SMRT purple line it is probably worth checking out only a few mins from the station but is a bit tricky to find as it is around the corner from Hougang central (block 805 under the car park)-they don't have the banh xeo crepe yet so watch this space-they prob use MSG but so does everyone else in Singapore (I have come to accept that)-overall I am happy there is a nice little Viet place that I can access in my area, Singapore needs more Vietnamese people who are producing good honest Vietnamese food. It may be a small shop in a hawker centre run by 2 aunties but isn't that where all the best food in Singapore is anyway? ;)"

This place happened to become one. On a Tuesday night, our Singapore team wanted to take us here. I had no idea what was in store but was excited to hangout w/ them after work. Everyone but the boss looks different w/o their uniform. A big round table was reserved. A total of 10 of us was there that night. I sat next to Sheng Teck and the boss. We talked about work and random things but the real action came once the food arrived. The boss ordered a whole roasted mini pig, clams, Peking duck, chili crab, butter crab, a chicken nest dish, chow mein, and a plate of rolls (came w/ the chili crab). Everything was great. + roasted pork was succulent + chicken / nest thing was good (but a little strange for me)+ chili crab was delicious (the sauce is bomb!)+ the rolls were buttery soft + the clams (I tried one) was ok+ rice was fluffy + a rare place that serves iced water if requested + service was fast I have a few weird things about me when it comes to food. For one, I can eat shellfish but it needs to be out of its shell first. I am petrified of touching them. I said that at the dinner table, planned to swerve the crab and go for the roasted pork and Peking duck but Sheng Teck took it upon himself to de-shell the crab for me. It was so sweet of him.. I had a shy smile on my face as my fellow colleagues from San Jose gave me a teased look; they know he and I are pretty fond of each other. And they think I bully him but that is untrue! I gave him more than half of my rice and picked food from other plates and gave it to him. I think I know why his colleagues teased him in their foreign language, haha.The culture is different than how it is back home. The team seems to be close, unlike back home. I felt that they all cared for one another genuinely.

The stall sells various types of meat (chicken, beef, lamb) as well as seafood and pasta on hotplates. Each of the main dishes (priced between $8 and $15) comes with two side dishes. I once had a grilled lamb chop for $9: the meat was cooked pretty well, and more importantly, the texture of the lamb was sinewy rather than crumbly - a good sign that the stall doesn't use processed meat. The sauce for the lamb chop is nothing outstanding, though decent.I also once paid for a grilled dory with spaghetti bolognaise on a hotplate for about $9, and the fish was not only tender but fresh. The spaghetti and the tomato sauce were average, but I felt that I had value for money for that meal. As for the sides, you won't go wrong with french fries and mashed potatoes. The coleslaw and rice are forgettable.The stall also sells calamari rings amongst a slew of hot and cold sides. The variety of dishes offered at this small outlet is surprisingly wide. Overall, I would recommend you give it a try. For me, the fact that you get relatively good quality meat for under $10, in a hawker centre with a laid-back atmosphere, is good enough for me to choose this over Aston's. Opening hours: 11am - 10pm"

We only started doing that last year and I was delighted to find so many old school hawkers manning their stalls. The only drawback of being here in the morning is that not all the stalls are open. There are 3 stalls which serve really good breakfast dishes and you could tell they have been operating for years, honing their skills to perfection. 1. Yong Xiang Carrot Cake (#01-35)This is THE place to get fried png kueh (Teochew rice cake). I have never had this before until this place and it sure hits the spot. I have heard of people frying png kueh but to fry it like frying carrot cake is new to me. Imagine a well fried carrot cake with the wok hei smell, sweet black sauce and egg and probably lard, but replace it with png kueh (the auntie will break it into smaller pieces with the spatula). Simply scrumptious but oh so sinful. The fried soon kueh done in this version is equally good too. 2. Singapore Bao (#01-61)My sister thoroughly ""heart"" this place just for the lo mai kai and siew mai. After a few miss attempts (I kept buying from the wrong stalls :p), I finally found the correct stall to buy the lo mai kai (glutinous rice with chicken mushroom). This is so traditional. The lo mai kai is encased in a metal bowl and the steamed the huge bamboo tray. If you order it to go, it will be popped out from the metal bowl and into a plastic sheet. No styrofoam boxes here. The lo mai kai is moreish and the ratio of rice to chicken pieces and mushroom is just right. I will prefer to have this without chili I find the chili sauce (like the usual Maggi brand) kind of overpower the taste. But the chili sauce does go well with the siew mai. 3. (#01-56) no English name, only in Chinese characters (Chee Cheong Fun) Follow the line. There is always a long queue for this stall and most people order the chee cheong fun (rice rolls). Besides the chee cheong fun, they also sell yam cake, congee (2 versions: peanut and century egg) and fried bee hoon. The chee cheong fun is thin and quite translucent, making it quite tender and not hard. I like the sauces, especially when liberally sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. The yam cake is not the soft wobbly kind and is a bit thicker and harder to me. I think I prefer it with a higher water content so that it is similar to carrot cake texture. The congee is smooth, like those found in Hong Kong style tea houses. Nice. What I really like is the fried bee hoon. Very tasty on its own and the chili (different from the chee cheong fun) has bits of fried crushed dried hae bee (shrimps) giving it a bit of smoky flavor. Now if only the fried egg I had was of the runny yolk kind, then it would be a perfect local breakfast."

Oh, and skip going to the toilets here. They're not that clean, and cost 10-cents.

We overheard the staff saying that the waiting time was about half an hour. Fortunately, we'd made a reservation, so we practically sailed right past the waiting line. I like the atmosphere of the cafe. It was open, inviting and bustling with activity. Perfect place for people-watching. We were seated on the balcony facing the stables. My initial concern was about the smell, but it was unnoticeable. We had the corned beef croquettes, Riders Burger, and homemade sausages with creme fraiche scrambled eggs. The croquettes were good - the crispy, golden brown breadcrumbs gave way to creamy potatoes with the occasional chewy beef bits. The corned beef offered a pleasant pop of flavour that accented the mild potato taste. They were truly enjoyable to eat. The portion was generous too. I expected maybe two pieces of croquettes but there were four - more than enough for a starter. The Riders Burger was all about the beef. The other ingredients were reminciscent of Burger King's Western Whopper, but they were all overwhelmed by the beef. This burger would be perfect for meat lovers.I chose the homemade sausages and creme fraiche scrambled eggs because they came with a leek and potato rosti. Unfortunately they looked better than they tasted. The hollandaise sauce was the best part of the dish. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy, but for the most part tasteless, but that was ok as we had salt and pepper at our table. The rosti was, strangely, creamy. It was essentially fried mashed potato and leek. There was a mild taste of leek on the fried surface, but that was overpowered by the flavourless mush that was underneath. Next to the mild flavours of the eggs and mush, the sausage tasted too strong, which shocks the taste buds. I dipped most of what I could in the hollandaise to get some flavour, but there was barely a spoonful of it to begin with. The food may have been slightly disappointing, but the service was excellent. The crew was attentive and proactive, and we could really tell that they were properly trained to provide high-level service. For that, kudos to the staff AND the owner/management of Riders Cafe for caring. Service really contributes half, if not more, to customer experience and satisfaction. For this, I would definitely go back to Riders (and order other things on the menu instead)."

It is not so bad as you get to gaze at the lush greenery, clear blue sky (if it is not raining) and listen to the neighing and clopping of horses every time they are led back into the stables. Quite enjoyable as it is not a common sight in this concrete jungle.Being my 2nd visit in a span of a few years, I am glad the food is still as good. We shared the pacific benedict and brioche french toast with bananas. They were excellent. Quite a generous serving of swimmer crab meat with nicely poached eggs and spinach and shrimp hollandaise (couldn't taste the shrimp) sauce. Something different from the usual egg benedict or eggs royale. The soft brioche made a perfect french toast. Loved the grilled banana caramelized with a thin layer of sugar, crispy bacon and maple syrup. The cafe mocha was also decent. Being a full house, service was a bit slow but not as bad as some places.

Fortunately and coincidentally, there was a table cancellation when I called on the previous day of visit and so we did not have much problems securing seats. The usual brunch suspects were delicious and certainly lived up to the predominantly positive comments that were aplenty in the media or online community. Brioche French Toast with Fresh Berries and Vanilla Mascarpone $14 are great for those who like to start the day on a sweet note. The alternative french toast option comes with maple butter, smoked bacon and burnt bananas. Unlike ""The Usual"" ($16), Black stone Benedict ($15) comes with the extra hollandaise sauce on poached eggs and crispy bacon instead of bangers and mushrooms.To me, hollandaise sauce is the supporting cast that makes the leading cast (soft poached eggs with bursting egg yolk) shine. I had been tempted all along to challenge the Death by Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice cream $12 but I was disillusioned eventually. This won by quantity and not quality. The chocolate ganache was not velvety and stood unmoving like a rubbery coating. There was not much contrast in the taste because everything from the cake to the ice cream was cloyingly sweet. Instead, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake with Crumbled Honeycomb $8 would attract one to take a second bite or even more. The cheesecake itself tasted as natural as it could get, without too much sugar added. Would be ideal if there is more of the salted caramel frosting. Special items of the day are written on the black board. Even though many other brunch spots and cafe have sprouted incessantly in Singapore, Riders Cafe is a good option for brunch or even dinner with the accompaniment of horses.

Fortunately and coincidentally, there was a table cancellation when I called on the previous day of visit and so we did not have much problems securing seats. The usual brunch suspects were delicious and certainly lived up to the predominantly positive comments that were aplenty in the media or online community. Brioche French Toast with Fresh Berries and Vanilla Mascarpone $14 are great for those who like to start the day on a sweet note. The alternative french toast option comes with maple butter, smoked bacon and burnt bananas. Unlike ""The Usual"" ($16), Black stone Benedict ($15) comes with the extra hollandaise sauce on poached eggs and crispy bacon instead of bangers and mushrooms.To me, hollandaise sauce is the supporting cast that makes the leading cast (soft poached eggs with bursting egg yolk) shine. I had been tempted all along to challenge the Death by Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice cream $12 but I was disillusioned eventually. This won by quantity and not quality. The chocolate ganache was not velvety and stood unmoving like a rubbery coating. There was not much contrast in the taste because everything from the cake to the ice cream was cloyingly sweet. Instead, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake with Crumbled Honeycomb $8 would attract one to take a second bite or even more. The cheesecake itself tasted as natural as it could get, without too much sugar added. Would be ideal if there is more of the salted caramel frosting. Special items of the day are written on the black board. Even though many other brunch spots and cafe have sprouted incessantly in Singapore, Riders Cafe is a good option for brunch or even dinner with the accompaniment of horses. But the location is only convenient if you can find your way there in a car or by a taxi."

It's a great way to get away from the skyscrapers and clogged roads that characterises much of Singapore these days. Smell a bit of green grass, smell a bit of horses.. it's very therapeutic. If you've eaten too much of it's good food, you can always loiter around afterwards and explore a bit. A very nice way to spend a morning. The only gripe I have is that it's extremely inaccessible. Even if you are up for a bit of a trek. It's quite impossible to walk in from Dunearn Road, or I haven't found a way yet!

Quite enjoyable as it is not a common sight in this concrete jungle.Being my 2nd visit in a span of a few years, I am glad the food is still as good. We shared the pacific benedict and brioche french toast with bananas. They were excellent. Quite a generous serving of swimmer crab meat with nicely poached eggs and spinach and shrimp hollandaise (couldn't taste the shrimp) sauce. Something different from the usual egg benedict or eggs royale. The soft brioche made a perfect french toast. Loved the grilled banana caramelized with a thin layer of sugar, crispy bacon and maple syrup. The cafe mocha was also decent. Being a full house, service was a bit slow but not as bad as some places.

Fluffy, buttery, creamy goodness with fresh blueberries and cream. Their poached eggs and salmon comes a close second. Plus enjoying it in a cosy setting against the greenery with horses grazing in the background doesn't hurt!You can take a walk outside and maybe have your kids go on a pony ride (only $10!) after brunch, its not just a nice romantic brunch place but good for families too.Final verdict: One of the most quaint brunch places in Singapore in one of the last countryside corners of this urban jungle."

The butter cream was not too sweet.Chocolate banana cake - $8+At $8+, it wasn't too bad, but it was very solid and jerlat too. The chocolate was very dense and I could sense ""heaty-ness"" in my throat, since I wasn't willing to run the extra km on the treadmill I shoved it to my guy friend to finish it up. Fish and Chips- $12+The truffle chips was the best part about this dish, you could smell the flavourful truffle oil, the second they placed the dish on the table. The fish itself was quite oily to be honest, the wasabi mayo was a nice change from the normal mayo. All in all, a decent cafe in the serangoon gardens area, but I wouldn't travel all the way there, if I wasn't in the area. But if you have pets, you might want to try and take them here, they sell pet cafe food too :D"

I ordered their set which allowed me one soup, a main and a drink. So I had corn soup (good), fettuccine carbonara (very good) and a cup of cold coffee (my friend said their hot coffees are not too bad, my cold coffee had a hint of sourness in it which I'm not that big of a fan of). If you are not a big fan of dogs (shame on you...), you can always go next door - same cafe but doggies are not allowed there. For the dogs, there is a menu for them too! Be prepared for wait abit, and the food does come a wee bit hot for the doggies. Though I must say that the two little four legged ones that I went with didn't seem to have too much of a problem with that. They are bowl available for the doggies for them to drink water, and mops are available in case of ""accidents"" :)"

Plus, my family recently adopted a dog, Pika, so I thought it would be great to socialize him with some of his furry friends. Sun Ray is one of the few pet friendly cafes in Singapore. They allow you take the leash off your pooch on the premise provided you clean up after it. Pooch are allowed on chairs and they even have a special dog menu :) So Pika and I headed there on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Initially, I was just going to order a cup of coffee and read on my kindle while Pika did his social rounds but I never got around to it. Instead I spent my time chatting with other dog lovers and joined them in the ritual of fawning and fussing over our pets. Pika picked out a BFF among 4 or 5 other dogs. She was a beautiful white poodle-maltese named Yumi and they played non-stop for 2 hours straight chasing each all over the restaurant. 0.0 In the end, I decided to have dinner there too since I could not bear to tear him away from his new found best friend. I decided to order a eggs benny. The eggs benny was served with a delicious cone instead of bread. It was the best part of the dish. A lesser known fact is that Sun Ray makes really really really good coffee. Think Nylon coffee good. Their barista Charmaine was kind enough to chat with me on different types of coffee and show me the equipment they used to make it. This is what I recalled from our conversation, 1. The French pressed method - gives a sweeter taste to the brew. 2. The Siphon method - gives the coffee a clearer appearance.3. The Pour over method - gives it a stronger and richer taste.*varies accordingly with the beans used, of course :) I ordered a flat white with soya milk. They used the brand Pacific. My first time trying it but it was as good as ""boysoy"" (not sure the exact spelling of this brand even though I had it multiple times). Overall, their coffee blew me away. I was not expecting such a high standard of coffee for a pet cafe? It totally beats The Coffee Daily (just next door). Sun Ray takes their coffee seriously and I'll definitely be back for more! I know Pika cannot wait to go back too :) PS: Charmaine cordially invites our coffee expert & beloved CM to try her brews!!! She's always excited to meet a fellow barista!"

Coffee appreciation courses are conducted here now and you can enjoy various coffee brewed using different techniques such as syphon, cold-brew, French press, and own specialty drip coffee. The folks even have their  own custom-roasted blend, called the Brighton blend. Needless to say, i got really high after sampling the various coffees. I quite enjoyed the latte and the iced mocha wasn't too shady as well. The cold brew will send your brain and heart into overdrive. Try it at your own risk! Now if only they serve better desserts to go with my coffee. After all, a good cafe has to have the entire package and that includes good sweets to accompany the coffee. The homemade scones ($3), which were promised to be crusty and buttery, fell terribly short of my expectation. This is not a scone. It's a cross between a bun and a really soft tart. I finished half the chocolate scone because i wanted to eat the chocolate chips. The blueberry and strawberry (or was it raspberry) ones reminded me of the Arnott's tartlets in terms of flavor. The crust was not even as crisp as Artnott's. Meh. I shall not even discuss the cupcakes ($3). Go figure. The Tiramisu ($6.50) weren't that bad after they defrosted. I believe SRC is working on adding more coffee to that recipe after our feedback. The Oven-Baked Escargots ($8.90 half-dozen | $15.90 one dozen) were well flavored with the garlic and parsley butter. They are typically served in the escargot pot but this was for our tasting purposes. The Wild Mushroom Soup ($7.90) was made fresh and came served with the perfumed truffle oil. I love the thick, creamy and smooth texture and intense flavor of this one. My favorite dish was the Carbonara ($12.90). This is the dish that i'll come back to SRC for (since it's in da hood). I'm glad that this pasta isn't swimming in sauce. This was pretty salty but i love that each mouthful had the smoky meat flavor of the bacon and each strand was nicely coated with sticky cream, raw egg yolk and cheese. Too good... J enjoyed the Cumin Crusted Lamb Rack ($23.90) which was served with ratatouille and rosemary sauce. The meat was tender and didn't have that gamey taste. The Grilled Strip Loin ($23.90) served with potato gratin and the Yorkshire Pork Rack ($23.90) with apple cider sauce both paled in comparison. Both meats were overdone and dry and we simply gave up after 2 bites (you can't say that we didn't give them a second chance). Hits and misses at Sun Ray Cafe. I would say go for their coffee and tiramisu. The carbonara and lamb rack are worth dropping by for as well. The atmosphere is pretty AJ after their reno though. i wonder why.. Anyway, special treat for my readers on my blog."

That was last year.I returned to this stall frequently and now the business is rolling. only recently I realized that it was related to the famous fatty cheong of Bukit Merah.The char siew here is the best meat around. There was no extra fake red colouring. It is roasted to natural colours of the condiments. The meat was chop to thick slices with a generous amount covering the plate of freshly cooked fluffy white rice. The meat had some fat on it and unfortunately that was the best part! the fat and the caramelized roasting sauce combined into the most delicious concoction.The rice and char siew is covered with a nice thick roast sauce giving much flavour to the rice.unfortunately they were no greens.... cucumber etc on it.

This is my favorite prawn noodle place and for it to be near my place is even better. The only drawback is getting there if you drive. There is very limited parking available and you may be better off parking in the residential area nearby. Or take the bus, the bus stop is right in front of the restaurant. I will only drive here in the non-peak afternoon period. Otherwise it is the bus for me even though it is only a couple of stops away. The heat of Singapore makes one wilt, so no walking under the hot sun. The soup has been consistently umami with a rich prawny taste. However I thought the soup lacked the customary flavor on my last visit. I hope it is a one-off thing as I would hate to think the standard has drop. The small portion is quite tiny with just 4 prawn halves for $4. Maybe it is time to get the bigger portion now. I like the ngoh hiang. The prawn fritter was so crispy and fresh. The dipping sauce was excellent too. I wished there was more of it though I think they would refill it if you ask. This place has been around for many years now and it has a friendly family feel to it. On my last visit, a domestic help came back with her takeaway order and told the staff her employer wanted just prawn noodles, not prawn with pork noodles. The staff was very kind and did not berate the help about the miscommunication in ordering (different languages after all) and instead told the help how to order it in future. And they cheerfully changed the order for her. I thought that was very kind of the restaurant people."

The best of both worlds, as they say. And the best of both worlds indeed, as both the noodles and the soup were equally satisfying.I ordered the version with both prawns and pork ribs. The prawns were very fresh, but the ribs were no slouch either; the meat was very tender and slid off the bone very easily. The component that really helps the prawn noodles here hit the home run is no doubt the fried chili. When you mix it with the noodles (with just the right quantity), the combination is really lethal.

So far, I've tried their original banh mi and although it could use more meat and cilantro, I appreciate how it's not all bread. Their toaster oven takes a while to heat up, but results in a sandwich toasted to perfection. The well balanced sauce and spices make it a win!Miguel usually orders their pho, and a taste test confirms that it's a-ok. Next time, I'm interested in trying their dry noodle bowls; the meat and egg roll combo does look tasty. The prices are fair (less than $8 per sandwich) and even though their next door neighbor is Subway, I don't see them as direct competitors. Great place to get that banh mi fix!"
