But they were nice and said goodbye when we left. Pastries: almond croissant was over-baked making it a little dry. But I appreciated that it wasn't ridiculously sweet like many cafes do now and the amount of almonds too! So that's a plus. Seating can be limited friends that people take a table for studying, laptops, etc. But there's an okay amount of seating. Selection of pastries, pretty good. Everything is supposed to be housemade which is nice as well. People seemed to be ordering the Swiss rolls of different flavors. Earl grey was out but matcha looked yummy. I did not order it but maybe another time if I come check it out. Tip: there's wifi! Tip2: you can order swissrolls in advance for pick up :)"

It was the first time I encountered so much difficulties tearing off the meat from the bones. When cold lettuces and cold pig liver/kidney slices are thrown into a broth that is not hot enough, the final outcome of the Pig Liver & Kidney Soup ($5) was a mishap that stink of blood. Besides Bak Kut Teh, this place also sells some zi char dishes like the miserable plate of Sambal Potato Leaves ($7) full of withered greens.

Together with the sides dishes - braided peanuts, Mui chai and fried youtiao. Their peppery soup was rather tasteless and tho you can taste the pepper, that's pretty much about it. The sliced pork was a little too fatty for my liking as half the slice will be the fats! The intestines was a little porky in the taste but I guess some folks like that. The side dishes were the decent ones that I have no complains about.

The amount of saltiness is just nice and all in all, I personally believe that it is no exaggeration that this is one of the tastiest bak kut teh soup that I have ever drunk. However, I feel that the meat here is not really up to standard; they were a little tougher compared to the best bak kut teh stalls that I have eaten at, and I believe this diminishes the meal somewhat. I always like my meat to be tender and to have the right amount of bite, but the meat here probably doesn't cut it. Still, the whole thing is nice.I also had the pig trotters and the intestines, which were nice but not too fantastic.

No frills, just like how they used to make'em in the old days.  Nothing superbly spectacular about it as a whole but you can tell that it's something special.It's a slightly above average plate of chicken rice that gets you there for sure. But there's something about that taste that brings you back to olden days Singapore food. The star however does not lie in the rice or noodles or chilli, the chicken is definitely one of the softest and most moist I've ever eaten!The sauce is uber thick but a tad starchy. It had a slight herbal flavour to it which made it fragrant. This is definitely a very unique alternative to your everyday normal plate of chicken rice.

What A ThaiI've heard of Yaowarat Seafood for a while now, constantly seeing more and more friends liking their facebook page. The gf and I had always wanted to head down but considering it's always just the 2 of us, we felt it wasn't worth it because we can't try much. Happens that it was my parents' anniversary so it gave us the perfect opportunity considering there were 8 of us for dinner! Although it's possible to walk in, seeing how the crowd streams in around 7pm, even on a Wednesday, it's highly recommended that you make a reservation. A glance at the menu show cases the variety of seafood available, from crabs to squid, to sea conch. We decided to go for some classic thai appetizers, and a few seafood dishes to give us a variety of food. Home Made Thai Seafood Cake. These were so so good! It was juicy, sweet, crispy and a real treat. The seafood cakes were beautifully fried and the sweet Chilli it comes with was perfect for the dish. Pity they only had 1 serving left, which was disappointing as we really wanted one or two servings more. A bit strange considering we were the second tables there yet they had already ran out of the seafood cakes. Thai Mango Salad and Thai Papaya Salad. A staple for any Thai restaurant. The salads were very fresh, offering enough punch with its sourness and saltiness. A great appetizer to help build up an appetite! A lot of places tend to hold back the flavors but not here. The flavours were bold and bringing you to Thailand with every bite. Stuffed Chicken Wings  A lot smaller than the picture suggest but still very good. The wings were beautifully fried and the stuffing was tasty. Home Made Prawn Spring Rolls Another great appetizer! The spring roles were thin and crispy, the stuffing, sweet and juicy. The perfect spring role! Crab Bee Hoon Soup. I know I know... Very un-Thai but this is one of our favourite crab dishes and we had to try it and we have noooooooo regrets. The soup was beautifully sweet, not oily and the key to this dish was the very sweet very fresh crab! How often have we eaten crabs that have disappointed but this one absolutely perfect. It was so fresh that I even managed to remove the meat from the claw perfectly. Definitely one of the best crab bee Hoon we've ever had. Steamed Marble Goby, HK style. This was the dish that made everyone's eyes pop. The sauce was not over powering and the fish was very very fresh and perfectly cooked. The meat was still juicy and firm and very flavorful with no trace of any fishiness. Every one of us thought it was very very good and raving about it after dinner. Steamed Seafood Platter. A seafood lovers paradise! With a whole crab, Venus clams and Fresh prawns (and boy were they fresh), all steamed in a sauce, this was definitely the highlight of our dinner. Considering how every protein has a different cook time, this dish was perfect. Gf felt the sauce was a little sweet while I though it was perfect. Overall still a very very good dish. BBQ Lobster with GarlicWith a current offer of a Boston lobster at $5 for every $150 spent, how could we say no! And this isn't some frozen lobster they need to clear either. These are fresh and beautifully cooked lobsters. The garlic compliments it well, not killing the natural sweetness of the lobster. Beautifully cooked.Pineapple fried rice. Definitely recommended! No artificial pineapple taste, rice was fluffy, pineapples added the perfect sour/ sweetness to the dish. Very very  good. Overall, the quality of food here is very very good. We felt that the staff were a little stretched and flustered, forgetting our drinks as it got busier. However, in terms of the quality! Excellent! Freshness is a key and they're certainly not shy to showcase that. We'll definitely be back to try their bamboo clams, crab with vermicelli and their Tom yum soup (I know, how could we not have ordered Tom yum soup right?!). I'd rate the food 4.5*. However, because of some of the starters and desserts not being available, and the slight waiting time to get the staff's attention, I'll need to drop it down to a 4* rating.But, if you're looking for a restaurant that only believes in serving the freshest available seafood, and not overpowering it with sauces than this is definitely the place to visit! All I can say it....... Aroi Mak Mak!"

Golden Roast - this roast chicken is not bad. Claypot Pork Belly with Salted Eggs - this is really a Claypot of goodness!

There are 3 choices of fish:For medium size (recommended for 3 to 4 persons)- Badang - Quite common in many fish soup places $40- Garoupa - This is good and meaty but has some bones when filleted. Bigger chunks that flake $50- Pomfret - Sweet and even texture $60We took the Garoupa. The dish was a good portion and can also be shared with 5 persons. It comes with quite a lot of vegetables inside and some pieces of yam. The soup was really thick and flavourful and the steamboat kept everything piping hot even after the fire had gone out. It's a complete meal with some rice. It was served with their garlic chilli sauce which is quite spicy but really tasty.We ordered some other dishes and really liked the hae cho (prawn rolls). The Indonesian style claypot $13 was quite unctuous but seemed quite fatty as well with lots of skin. Simple stir fried veg was a generous portion for medium $11.

Don't get me wrong. But the whole experience just felt underwhelming. By the way, for those not in the know, it isn't actually a ""steamboat"" you expect in hotpot restaurant where you cook raw food. The dish comes boiling and the ingredients are already cooked when it's presented at the table. I've had this dish at their rival over at Serangoon Road twice before. I remember the soup over there being tastier. But we also ordered other dishes here like hei cho, sambal kang kong and prawn paste chicken wings. All were good but not outstanding. The chicken was particularly tasty. The whole meal for two ended up totaling $80. Felt like a rip off when I saw that we were charged for things like rice (it must be a cultural thing as I've not encountered additional payment for unlimited rice refills in any other country), soup refills (clearly a hidden cost because there's no way anybody would not ask for a refill since the first serving is a pathetic amount based on the shallowness of the pot), chrysanthemum leaves which you add into the soup and paper napkins. The waitress didn't have the initiative to inform that the leaves were an additional cost when she asked if I wanted them (the hotpot already comes with cabbage). Which I guess is typical ""service"" in Singapore. The ""soup refill"" and chrysanthemum leaves (a small plate of tatty looking vegetables) was $6."

Always choose  the amount of fish +1 more than the number of people you have because portion is rather small or I am a big eater. The soup is souperlicious! I really like the milky salty taste of it.

Not fantastic, but not bad either. Your typical crystal jade standard, if you get what I mean. The char siew and siew yok combination is decent. The char siew was a little too lean though, and probably could have been better if it was slightly more fatty. The stir fried fillet with ginger and scallion was pretty yummy. Love that the fish was fresh :) Sautéed string beans with minced pork is a great fish to go with rice. I love how it has a slightly savory taste which is perfect with rice. A tad oily though! We wanted to order the San bei ji (3 Cup chicken) but unfortunately they removed it from their menu :( we ordered some other stir fried chicken in bean sauce which was way too salty :( not recommended!"

You can find the usual fare here, such as hot plate tofu, yam ring, and sambal kang kong. The food won't make you go ""wow!"", but it's not terrible either.

The cafe interior is great, air-conditioned, wide spaces, high ceilings, a range of sofas and seats for the solo people-watcher to diners. Food-wise, nothing to shout about. I would say over-priced too for the type of foods that they serve, but arguably the prices are quite typical of any cafes you'd visit. (The iced espresso ball was $9, and it was really just a little cup of iced latte. Guess you're paying extra for the fun of melting the espresso with milk)It's self-service at this place -- order at the cashier and get a buzzer, pick up your food from the counter once the buzzer rings. They don't charge GST and Service Charge here. They only have 4 parking spaces in front of their outlet (where the signature blue gates are). Free parking available on weekends at the industrial building next to it. Alternatively, limited street parking is also available (60c per half hour, even on Sundays). They are on Burpple Beyond, but there are T&Cs behind the Beyond deals -- a max of 4 redemptions per table, and any Beyond payments need to be made via cash or nets only.

I'm not talking just a dozen people, but a hundred, maybe more! There's two areas to sit. Behind the glass doors, you might be lucky to score a seat on the big communal table where you can read magazines and relax in AC comfort. Outside there's more seating and also the view of the bicycle workshop where you can buy a funky bike or bring yours to be serviced. I spied some cute kids helmets sporting animal faces, and only wished they came in big-kid sizes!We stopped in for drinks only - there's coffee and tea, interesting soft drinks and also a small selection of beers.

No wonder any kind of place devoted to cyclists will always catch my attention.Wheeler's Yard is on a quiet area in the border between Whampoa and Toa Payoh. The restaurant is inside a spacious industrial warehouse, sharing the massive space with a bicycle shop and self-labeled atelier. In a time of crammed cafes and confined restaurants dubbed as ""intimate"", the high ceilings and massive tables of the restaurant are a delight. The whole place is a vintage paradise, highly appealing to architectural restoration enthusiasts. They basically kept as much as they could from the original warehouse and made the restaurant and atelier fit in there, creating a vast place with a warm atmosphere, ideal for groups and sharing.The menu is varied, with some Japanese inspiration and local ingredients. I had a nicely done pan-seared snapper served in a small pool of fragrant mushroom stock. It was not spectacular, but the flavours were wisely balanced. My wife had a sous vide chicken, which was juicy and fairly tasty. We also had the truffle fries, which we liked a lot. They have a small, careful selection of local craft beers at reasonable prices. Another plus is they don't impose service charge, since the place actually works on a self service basis. The food prices are not those of a self-service place, though.All in all, Wheeler's Yard works as a retreat from the race of the chase. It feels ideal for a quiet afternoon in Whampoa (which is quiet enough itself). I can imagine myself arriving there after a long and tiring urban cycle ride. Yeah, that's going on my list."

We were there too early for dinner, so we ordered a bowl of truffle fries to share ($14.90, i think).The truffle fries were AMAZING. The moment the bowl was set on the table in front of me, I was hit by the aroma of truffles. That was when I knew this was going to be an experience to remember. The fries were hot and crispy and the chef was definitely liberal with the truffle oil and grated cheese. The portion was just right for 2 people, and we polished it off in no time.

My burger was slightly undercooked and VERY greasy and the fries (which I had heard good things about) were dry and overcooked. The breakfast items were rather bland as well.

Literally, the place can turned into anything the owner desires.  In terms of the food, the Fried Calamari dipped in black sweet sauce is a MUST try. I know I sound like a broken record that this and that is the Best in Singapore. But, why not, I'll say it again, the Best Calamari dish in Singapore. The Calamari portions are huge, even for Singapore and the Sauce was well... the bomb diggitty. The Prawn Aglio Olio, which I seem to try at every restaurant, was good, but doesn't compare to Starker down the road. I didn't try the bbq ribs, but I might as well have had it since my fellow communal seating partner was gorging himself right next to me.

Boy! Was I glad I decided to take the path less travelled! The Ribeye steak was delicious (I had it medium done)! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about their burgers! My friend asked the cashier, ""what's good here?""She replied, ""up to you lor""Unsatisfied with the answer I chimed in, ""but what would you recommend?""She asked, ""the burger"" He decided to go with her recommendation but we weren't impressed. The meat was subpar. It tasted kinda chewy and over marinated... kinda like cheap sausage meat grounded into a patty? Either she has poor taste or she gave him really bad information. Coffee-wise, I really didn't think that they were as good as Nylon etc. Passable but it wasn't impressive.Service was also rather slow that day. My steak came out on time but my friends' food didn't. Ambiance-wise, Wheeler is unbeatable! A beautiful hipster cafe! I love the concept and the deco. Not so much the location and the parking. There's barely enough lots to fit 5% of the customers. They only have 4 lots out front. All 4 were taken when we arrived. Plus, the remote location (an industrial like area) didn't really help because it wasn't very accessible via public transportation so I wished they had more parking space!"

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries to go, and I was not disappointed.  The one weakness has to be the bun again.  Seems like the obsession for a soft bun in Singapore, while great for cold sandwiches and on its own, is quite difficult for a juicy burger. The liquid totally overwhelms the buns and the bun crumbles.  But let's also talk about what Burger bar does right.  The patty was solid and so were the fries.  The price point is very good - $8-10 for a burger, $3.50 ad more for fries.  Definitely a place that you can come to weekly without breaking the bank, for a decent burger and fries."

The quality of the cooking is in the league of Valentino's although they do not have as much traditional cooked items (and I am not complaining as long as what is on the menu is done well). In terms of ambience, I am glad they have shifted to Greenwood Avenue from Jln Pemimpin. The restaurant offers modern, chic, casual dining and is much larger with both indoor and outdoor seating vs its previous location. Its staff strength has also swelled to cater to the larger seating capacity.  Marcus and his team always makes me feel welcome whenever I drop by. If you drive (and parking is a bitch here), there's a valet service. I love the squid ink pasta and squid ink risotto which you don't need to pre-order, unlike Valentino's. You can taste the freshness and tenderness of the seafood, plus the pasta and risotto are done al dente (and I am pretty fussy that this basic stuff ought to be done right) as it should.  They are prepared using authentic squid ink sauce and not squid ink pasta.  The pizza is good too (thin crust) with just the right amount of balance between cheese and ingredients and their seafood is one of the freshest you can get. I was told the seafood is hand-picked at the fish market every morning.  I have no complaints about the steak, nicely grilled on the outside and juicy and tender (not chewy) on the inside, cooked as well as can be expected. In summary, the quality and consistency of the food here is amazing considering the copious amount of food being prepared for its ravenous crowd.And the chocolate verdant dessert is to die for, crispy on the outside and soft molten chocolate lava flowing from the inside.  We tend to over-eat and often end up with no room for dessert. When we are here, we make sure we exercise restrain so that we don't miss out on the dessert. The wine menu has also been much improved and now comes with a much larger variety of Italian wine.  It's a great place to dine with a large group of friends or with the family. And having said that, I should organize a group dinner here soon. I am glad to see that it is crowded and the restaurant is doing well so that more people in Singapore will continue to enjoy quality Italian fare.Bon appetit!!"

Cuttlefish given was generous and was soft and chewable while the Sambal was not too spicy together with the cut pieces of Fried Kang Kong.Large chunks of fish meat with slices of ginger and vegetables together with thick bee hoon are the usual sights that we expect from Cze Char's stall Fish Meat Noodle Soup. I was rather disappointed with the soup as it was rather bland without much taste but on a good note, usage of MSG is minimal.The exterior texture of the roll was indeed very thin and crispy, unlike what I had in most Cze Char Stall. As for its fillings, its rather ordinary, pairing up with the sweet sauce provided.The pork ribs are indeed very flavourful with sweetness and sour taste. It was intense and the amount of meat given was generous. It's recommended just as what they state on their menu.""Wok Hei"" taste from the ""San Lao"" Hor Fun was present. This individual serving of Hor Fun had a significant use of fish slices as well as bean sprouts.It was a tasty and recommended dish on its menu but, to be honest, it's good but not to die for as there are better ones out there.Though the cereal prawn was packed with fragrance and hints of milk powder, we still find that the taste of prawns was kind of lacking and bland. The taste from the ""star"" of the dish was not up to our expectation but instead the cereal that is complimenting the prawns taste better as a whole. Well, I would have skipped this dish.With some hits and misses, if I'm going for popular dishes like San Lao Hor Fun, Fish Meat Noodle Soup and Crispy Prawn Roll, I will most likely go to the usual Holland Village XO Fish Head Bee Hun. However, their menu was rather standard and not with a variety like Hong Kong Street. In addition, with so many dishes ordered, we felt that the price was reasonable & pocket friendly for a popular Cze Char place like this. It is definitely a good place for a family meal during the weekends and do note that reservations can be made in advance for big groups only."

The pork was very tasty and tender, however the pork could be abit more crispy. Nonetheless, a great place for a great family meal, with a very small bill.Do make a reservation if plan to eat here from 7pm onwards, they get very busy and sometimes the kitchen falls behind on the orders, which is expected for these cofffee shop zi char stalls."

Her chicken rice is fragrant, fluffy and cooked with just the right amount of gasp... chicken fat and 1 bowl of rice is never quite sufficient. The other thing that I come here for, is, the free flow of soup. Yes the soup might be a little too salty, & yes... its also, maybe a little too peppery... BUT it is unbelievably addictive. I have seen people do takeaways with their own carriers (mind you, they are large carriers) for the soup. and oh yes, of course, the chicken is tender, juicy and faultless to say the least.Hands down... this is the best chicken rice in Singapore, in my opinion.

It was the most fragrant and fluffy rice cooked in chicken fat that i've tasted. I immediately proclaimed it to be the best chicken rice in Singapore in between gobbles. According to S, it was a random buy but i thought we hit chicken rice jackpot. It was only when i took a closer look at the stall that i realize this is no ordinary chicken rice stall. They have won some award back in 2009 for their traditional Hainanese dishes.I like the broken and slightly soft rice grains. This shows that they have been simmered in a rich stock of fried ginger, garlic, chicken stock (and some fats) and salted for additional flavor. Some people have complained that this is too healthy. Seriously?? I don't care as long as it tastes good. The fragrance of stock has penetrated and locked itself within each grain of rice and you can simply eat this on its own. No need for chili or dark soy sauce (i thought the dark soy overpowers the flavor of the rice). I actually contemplated having a second bowl of rice! Amazeballs!The chicken is nicely flavored as well. They served us breast meat for the individual plates though. I should have said i want the thigh meat for that additional succulence and tenderness. The breast meat wasn't dry though and was juicy enough.The chili was a killer. It really stings. There is a nice sourness and spiciness to the blend of ginger, garlic and chili. Go easy on it if you can't take chili."

I'm not sure if I can add anything else. Yes, Bourdain was here. As usual, he is right. This quintessential Singaporean dish of chicken and rice is so perfectly done that you can't find fault in it. Incredibly soft chicken, fragrant rice and the sauce is deliciously spiced with ginger puree. I ordered a large portion (S$8.80 for a large though?!) so I could get more chicken and got the soy egg for extra protein. There wasn't a wait when I came in at 11am. The crowds came at lunch time when the surrounding office workers were out.

I did the chicken rice challenge between Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and Liao Fan Hawker Chan. The ever-so-popular Michelin Guide praised one with a single star, and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain (RIP).In comparison, both prices were similar, and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours. The most significant difference between these two stands was their style. One was soy sauce based, while the other was a stock-based. If I had a vote between the two, purely based on my opinion, I would give my vote to this restaurant. I loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken. Served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity. Along with the meal, they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce, which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain. I loved this place for the price. Although it did not fill me up, it was enough for me to have the right amount of energy to start my day."

A lot of stalls weren't open yet so we just got a drink and waited. Line started forming close to 10AM and the line got long reallly quick. The first orders took awhile and we were prob 3rd or 4th in line. Order the large chicken rice to share with 2 for 7.80. Chicken was very juicy, soft and tender! Rice was good and goes well.

But what is Hainanese chicken rice? In short -- it's seasoned poached chicken with rice, served with chilli sauce and garnished with cucumber. It was created by immigrants from Hainan province in southern China as a cheap and easy meal.We hit up the Maxwell Food Center as part of a tour with Sneak Peek Singapore. This stall wasn't part of our tour (that sampled foods from other stalls with no wait). So I recommend tag teaming with someone. The line moves quickly, but anticipate a wait of 20-30 minutes. We BARELY got our chicken in time before our tour nearly left us behind. The stall sells other dishes like vegetables with oyster sauce and cuttlefish. But you basically come here for one dish only -- the famed Hainanese chicken rice. I recommend ordering the most popular option -- a medium-sized chicken rice priced at $5 Singaporean dollars (or about $3.60 USD).What's the verdict? Was the wait worth it? I think so. The rice was perfectly cooked. Though, the chicken tasted pretty similar to other places we tried.  If you have the time to wait (and patience), add it to your foodie check list. Or if you hate waiting like me, tag team with another person to wait in line."

The portion sizes here are on the smaller size, so my ""large"" order was much smaller than I expected. The roasted chicken was nicely cooked, but the rice was what stole the show for me. The rice had a very strong chicken aroma and flavor that made it quite delicious. The red chili sauce that came on the side added a rather strong spicy kick to each bite (it was spicier than I expected).I enjoyed the chicken rice that I got here.

Having eaten over a hundred Hainanese Chicken Rice dishes I was about to eat the world's best. Located in a hawker like setting, be prepared to sweat bullets. We decided to go at night. Once inside this area, with stall after stall of open kitchen, you will feel the heat. It's hotter than outside. The line is long but it moves fast. Not going to lie, I am not used to these conditions. As my son and I grab a table with strangers, we wait with the large fans above blowing at us with no relief. As the dishes are placed in front of me, I can tell how juicy and succulent the dark meat looks. What I didn't quite expect was the strange gelatinous coating all over the chicken. I'm not sure what that is but I dig in. It is beyond tender and the skin on the chicken was very silky. Again, I was a bit bothered by that gelatinous coating. As I take each bite, it was hard to eat as the large fans kept blowing my hair and getting stuck against my sweaty face. I had to make sure I wasn't eating my hair and the chicken at the same time. Unfortunately, I've had more fragrant chicken rice than this before. It's still good but nothing special. All in all we did enjoyed the meal. The method where they quickly poach their chicken works. Had I have eaten it in a much cooler environment, I might have enjoyed my meal better. There are no napkins as Singapore has a go-green policy. You can wash your hands at a sink as you exit out."

What's special is the rice which was very flavorful as they have adjusted their recipe multiple times per what I've read online. Wait and line 1/5The wait is 30+ minutes at 12pm on Saturday. The wait at Ah tai is much shorter and the taste is very similar as it was opened by someone who used to work at tian tian. Ah tai has a better yelp rating and a better price to value ratio.Price 4/5Generally hawker center is cheap. Compared to other hainan chicken places there tian tian is considered slightly more expensive. At ah tai you pay $5 for a set (chicken, rice, soup and veggie) which is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure Comparison to Ah tai: Tian tian's rice tastes better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening. However the price is slightly more expensive with $9 if you want the veggies and chicken. The portions are slightly smaller and you wait faaar longer. Overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken. If you do have time and what to taste the best one. Take a shot and wait in line"

For my first visit, I can't decide between the poached or the roasted chicken, so when in doubt, the rule of thumb is to get both! :P. The chicken was tender and juicy while the rice was flavorful with a mouthwatering aroma! Altogether there was a good harmony between the chicken, rice, chili sauce and soy sauce. I honestly love both versions, but the later added a nice smoky flavor that I like.The pricing was dead cheap with each plate costing around $4-8 SGD (depending on the portions) and food was served canteen style.

Botanical garden, orchid garden, garden by the bay's skywalk, Chinatown was next. So I arrived and it was hot - so I was very lost and was happy to be lost. Lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot. All I really wanted was Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. Truth be told, it's changed in the last decade, or maybe I've changed. The first time I had it was in 2010. I thought it was disgusting. I did not have any acquired taste for Asian food then. I barely saw any Asians in my life. Now I must admit, I've got a more refined taste for everything Asian. Tian tian has a line. On a Sunday afternoon at 3:55 PM. All tourists, I gathered. Anthony Bourdain was here. The lady in front of me was from London, Asian British lady. On her honeymoon. We chatted about this spot, and we each ordered a small plate. Holy cow, $3 USD basically. We ate happily with chili on the side (we made friends while standing in line). The location is called Maxwell Center or something with Maxwell in it. You need to walk away from Chinatown, passing by some super cool buildings that house Chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area. Excellent atmosphere. Exceptional chicken dish. I would definitely take friends and families there. Not that I have anyone who would visit me in Singapore. Not that I go to Singapore that often. But this chicken is growing on me. And this stall."

The chili lime sauce that comes as a dip, taste delicious too, but beware it can be a bit spicy. It gives the chicken a bit of kick and a twist. It almost taste like a Thai lime sauce. The boiled bak choy comes with a fried shallot sauce, which just makes everything taste better. The squid with bean sprouts came with a Thai sauce and chili but it was not spicy at all.

It continues to be a solid choice, delivering a solid consistently good, wholesome, flavorful, and traditionally authentic product.  So take away everything that's been written or said about Tian Tian in recent history and it'll stand on its own as a solid choice for chicken rice if you're in the neighborhood.  Is there a better chicken rice out there? Almost certainly, but that misses the entire point of a chicken rice stall in a food centre in Singapore.  At the end of the day, it's all about accessibility.  That these hawker centres were purpose-built to make affordable nutrition accessible.  That hawkers, over the years,  have devoted time and passion into making their offerings actually good is a wondrous unintended consequence of this most Singaporean of experiments.  So yes, Tian Tian is still good, pandemic or no, and hopefully will continue to be a solid go to option when wandering around Maxwell.  Do I think it's the best chicken rice in Singapore...for that answer you'll have to get to know me much better first."

We decided to go for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant, simply because of the many positive Yelp reviews and also the fact that the place was featured by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant opens at 10am and already there is a very long lineup.  Other places serves similar menu and gets only customers who have no patience for waiting in line.   Service was very fast, but do not expect too much, except having a chance to taste this famous dish as this a food court and tables are not necessarily spotlessly clean. I ordered 2 Hainanese Chicken Rice.   The cashier pointed to 2 vegetable dishes displayed as pictures on the board, cuttlefish sprout and bokchoy vegetables.  I ordered one of each, thinking that these came complementary as part of the menu I ordered. Had I known, I would have skipped the vegetables.   15 minutes later, I was walking away with my order. Bill comes to $18, being $5 for Hainanese Chicken and $4 for the vegetables. The chicken is very tender, so tender that it just melts in your mouth.  There are no bones and practically no fat.  But, frankly, I am more used to have chicken which has a bit of a bite.   There is a sauce that you get on the side that would spice the food up, but I find the meat to be quite bland without.  Very affordable, and worth a try."

It's boiled chicken; honestly I think it's a cooking style that won't suit a lot of Westerners. It's more about textures rather than flavors. I ordered a large and it came with its own plate of rice. The chicken was lean with a bit of fat and the meat overall was soft and juicy. The skin was very silky and went well with the rice.

If that wasn't reason enough, a helpful hint I always go by is that you always eat where the locals flock to. There's a good reason for that line you're about to stand in.

It didn't even make it to the top 10 best Hainan Chicken Rice I've had. First off, the chicken was ice cold. I understand that some place don't serve their chicken hot but having chicken that basically just came out of the fridge is quite unappetizing.

Also, I noticed that a lot of other competing chicken rice stalls have a similar look to Tian Tian, so do check the names before waiting in line if you're looking for the ""famous"" chicken rice place (aka Tian Tian).

They also don't offer the typical chicken broth or ginger sauce but those aren't really necessary. The rice itself was fragrant and full of flavor, and the garlic chili sauce was just perfect with the right amount of heat. The vegetable with oyster sauce is just your typical baby bok choy blanched in water so nothing to rave about, but we always order some veggies with every meal.Definitely stop by here to try Singapore's national dish and eat like a local."

I jumped into the line when I noticed it was just a couple of folks on a weekday at around 3pm. That's when I noticed they had receipts with them. I obviously missed something. It did indeed turn out to be too good to be true. Tian Tian's recent notoriety has enabled them to take over the stall next door solely for taking orders and handling payment so customers move assembly-line style down to the next stall to receive their order. It's efficient but not very friendly. The rice is the star - fragrant and flavorful. The chicken is really moist and works well with the chili sauce. Thick soy sauce is available too but you have to request it which you should. All in all, pretty stellar chicken rice."

The chicken and rice dish definitely hit the spot. The skin was full of oil that was naturally coming out from the chicken and melts right in your mouth. As well, the chicken meat was super tender and juicy. It is always a pleasure eating chicken in Asia as it is much more naturally flavourful than the ones in America.

As the dishes are put before me, I can tell how delicious and succulent the dim meat looks. What I didn't exactly expect was the bizarre thick covering everywhere throughout the chicken. I don't know what that is but rather I delve in. It is past delicate and the skin on the chicken was extremely sleek. Once more, I was somewhat pestered by that thick covering. As I take each chomp, it was difficult to eat as the huge fans continued blowing my hair and stalling out against my sweat-soaked face. I needed to ensure I wasn't eating my hair and the chicken simultaneously. Shockingly, I've had more fragrant chicken rice than this previously. It's still great however nothing unique.

While the rice is definitely soft and fragrant, the chicken was flavorless... and cold. I've never received chicken and rice in Singapore with cold chicken so assumed this was the specialty of Tian Tian, but aside from just being tender, there was nothing about the way this dish was served that marked it as something I'd come out of the way for. The second time I came here was out of my boyfriend's interest to try and had the exact same experience.

Disappointed, yes. Upset, maybe but never angry.While I know that food review sites and awards are always subjected to the reviewer's tastebuds, I never really thought that I would get so angry over a stall that doesn't deserve its award..... until today. For years I've been wanting to give Tian Tian Chicken Rice a try but could never bring myself to join the crazy queue. Than came Singapore's edition of the Michelin Guide and with a Bib Gourmand recommendation, the queues became even longer and after tasting it for the first time today....I can't help but think WHY? Tian Tian chicken rice lacks just about everything I would consider as a good chicken rice. The Rice.While the texture of the rice was fine, it was neither fragrant or tasty. It lacked the depth that a lot of better chicken rice places have. It didn't have that pungent garlic or ginger taste, or the umami-ness of the chicken stock used to cook the rice. While the colour looked on point, the flavours were severely lacking. The ChickenSeeing that it was our first time trying, we ordered a portion of white (boiled) chicken and a portion of the roasted. Portions were generous but the meat was overcooked and stringy. The white chicken didn't have the smooth, moist , juicy texture that help make chicken rice so famous. Instead, it was overcooked and stringy.The roast chicken didn't fair any better. Overcooked, stringy and the skin didn't offer any flavours to the protein. The only plus point was the sauce that was drizzled over the chicken, which was fragrant and tasty but even that could not offer any redemption to the overall disappointment to the dish. To the tourists that have tried it because of the Bib Gourmand, my sincerest apologies for not offering you the best chicken rice experience in Singapore and for those you are thinking about trying, please don't, there are better options out there. Michelin recommended? Better to rip that page out of the book."

Tian Tian was recommended to me by a Singaporean-Malaysian-Chinese friend from the states who had visited before. This was also my first time trying Hainanese Chicken rice. I was impressed to say the least. Lemme just say, this place is hyped up but it's for a reason. This is a ~no-frills, order at the counter, sit down in the Singapore humidity~ and eat type of establishment. When we approached the stall, there was already a small line formed. First, you pay for your order then you wait as it's assembled.  I waited for about 10 minutes before receiving my food. I ordered a medium sized chicken rice, with the soy sauce and the spicy sauce. It.Was.INCREDIBLE. The chicken was perfect. I'm a big fan of big flavor, and I was a little surprised that boiled chicken would be so good. I mixed with the thickened soya sauce and it was heaven. The rice was fluffy and in the words of Anthony Bourdain ""absolutely fragrant."" and the cucumbers added perfect, refreshing crunch. I was STARVING on this day, and I just had to go back for seconds. I ordered myself a small size chicken rice this time, the cooks at the counter chuckled and said ""back for more?""

That's why even though it was closed the first day I went (on a Thursday evening!?) I decided to go again the next day.Well, first things first, the price was unbeatable. Only $4 for a chicken rice plate?! Although the portion wasn't that big, it was pretty filling and I felt kind of full with just one plate. It was probably the rice - which had a fantastic smell of chicken oil+coconut. The chicken however was just okay. It wasn't very tender and a bit on the dry side. But again the experience of eating the rice itself was so enjoyable that it added points to the chicken as well.I give 4 stars mostly because of the price and the rice. Quality of the chicken and the long line doesn't really justify it to be a 5-star restaurant. If I could go to Singapore again, this wouldn't be on my list of ""must-go"" restaurants but I wouldn't mind dropping by and grabbing a plate."

The ever-so-popular Michelin Guide praised one with a single star, and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain (RIP).In comparison, both prices were similar, and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours. The most significant difference between these two stands was their style. One was soy sauce based, while the other was a stock-based. If I had a vote between the two, purely based on my opinion, I would give my vote to this restaurant. I loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken. Served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity. Along with the meal, they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce, which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain. I loved this place for the price.

Compared to the Bay area, where it takes 10 mins to just find you a table, this was a breeze. The plates & bowls on which they actually served the chicken & soup, while not perfectly clean, was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers. Hey, that's how it goes, right?Now, the actual food. The rice, was something you can eat just by itself. It was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world. And it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken. The soup just tied it all together.I was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones?! I was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience. But overall, for that price and quality, a must go. But don't wait in line too long though.

The online reported wait times turned out to be quite exaggerated based on our experience. It took us about 15 minutes to get served, and that is only because they were running behind and hadn't opened on time, meanwhile a crowd was building. If we had arrived at 10:45am, the wait would've been at most 5 minutes.With the volume of business that Tian Tian does, they've perfected the service. You decide what size you want and pay at the first section, then walk over to the second section and pick up your plate of food. Finally, find any seat at the hawker centre and enjoy your meal. It's very simple and efficient.I have to say that I enjoyed the chicken very much. However, is it better than other chicken rice in Singapore? I think not."

But what is Hainanese chicken rice? In short -- it's seasoned poached chicken with rice, served with chilli sauce and garnished with cucumber. It was created by immigrants from Hainan province in southern China as a cheap and easy meal.We hit up the Maxwell Food Center as part of a tour with Sneak Peek Singapore. This stall wasn't part of our tour (that sampled foods from other stalls with no wait). So I recommend tag teaming with someone. The line moves quickly, but anticipate a wait of 20-30 minutes. We BARELY got our chicken in time before our tour nearly left us behind. The stall sells other dishes like vegetables with oyster sauce and cuttlefish. But you basically come here for one dish only -- the famed Hainanese chicken rice. I recommend ordering the most popular option -- a medium-sized chicken rice priced at $5 Singaporean dollars (or about $3.60 USD).What's the verdict? Was the wait worth it? I think so. The rice was perfectly cooked. Though, the chicken tasted pretty similar to other places we tried.  If you have the time to wait (and patience), add it to your foodie check list.

Once inside this area, with stall after stall of open kitchen, you will feel the heat. It's hotter than outside. The line is long but it moves fast. Not going to lie, I am not used to these conditions. As my son and I grab a table with strangers, we wait with the large fans above blowing at us with no relief. As the dishes are placed in front of me, I can tell how juicy and succulent the dark meat looks. What I didn't quite expect was the strange gelatinous coating all over the chicken. I'm not sure what that is but I dig in. It is beyond tender and the skin on the chicken was very silky. Again, I was a bit bothered by that gelatinous coating. As I take each bite, it was hard to eat as the large fans kept blowing my hair and getting stuck against my sweaty face. I had to make sure I wasn't eating my hair and the chicken at the same time. Unfortunately, I've had more fragrant chicken rice than this before. It's still good but nothing special. All in all we did enjoyed the meal. The method where they quickly poach their chicken works.

The chicken was top notch. Flavorful and super juicy and soft. The pepper was great...I asked for 2. Lol! I went back before we left and they were closing and only had breast left. They discounted to $5 each. I took 2. Even the breast was super moist. I wish I could eat this every day!

This place is extremely hyped through media and is being recommended on all travel guides and hotels. Flavor 3.5/5The chicken is very standard. What's special is the rice which was very flavorful as they have adjusted their recipe multiple times per what I've read online. Wait and line 1/5The wait is 30+ minutes at 12pm on Saturday. The wait at Ah tai is much shorter and the taste is very similar as it was opened by someone who used to work at tian tian. Ah tai has a better yelp rating and a better price to value ratio.Price 4/5Generally hawker center is cheap. Compared to other hainan chicken places there tian tian is considered slightly more expensive. At ah tai you pay $5 for a set (chicken, rice, soup and veggie) which is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure Comparison to Ah tai: Tian tian's rice tastes better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening. However the price is slightly more expensive with $9 if you want the veggies and chicken. The portions are slightly smaller and you wait faaar longer. Overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken. If you do have time and what to taste the best one. Take a shot and wait in line"

Nestled in Chinatown's iconic Maxwell Hawker Center, this particular stall is easy to spot thanks to the long lines as well as a big poster of Anthony Bordain next to it. Their menu is pretty straightforward and all the usual suspects are available - steamed/roasted chicken and vegetables in oyster sauce. For my first visit, I can't decide between the poached or the roasted chicken, so when in doubt, the rule of thumb is to get both! :P. The chicken was tender and juicy while the rice was flavorful with a mouthwatering aroma! Altogether there was a good harmony between the chicken, rice, chili sauce and soy sauce. I honestly love both versions, but the later added a nice smoky flavor that I like.The pricing was dead cheap with each plate costing around $4-8 SGD (depending on the portions) and food was served canteen style. Simple, affordable and utterly delicious.... Can't help but to fall in love with Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice!"

Still have not made to this place until recently. I had one day that I was in Singapore before the work week started and I had made a determination to check off the lists on my guidebook. Botanical garden, orchid garden, garden by the bay's skywalk, Chinatown was next. So I arrived and it was hot - so I was very lost and was happy to be lost. Lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot. All I really wanted was Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. Truth be told, it's changed in the last decade, or maybe I've changed. The first time I had it was in 2010. I thought it was disgusting. I did not have any acquired taste for Asian food then. I barely saw any Asians in my life. Now I must admit, I've got a more refined taste for everything Asian. Tian tian has a line. On a Sunday afternoon at 3:55 PM. All tourists, I gathered. Anthony Bourdain was here. The lady in front of me was from London, Asian British lady. On her honeymoon. We chatted about this spot, and we each ordered a small plate. Holy cow, $3 USD basically. We ate happily with chili on the side (we made friends while standing in line). The location is called Maxwell Center or something with Maxwell in it. You need to walk away from Chinatown, passing by some super cool buildings that house Chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area. Excellent atmosphere. Exceptional chicken dish. I would definitely take friends and families there. Not that I have anyone who would visit me in Singapore. Not that I go to Singapore that often. But this chicken is growing on me. And this stall."

We enjoyed this place so much that we came back for a second meal the same day and totally don't regret doing it. The chili lime sauce that comes as a dip, taste delicious too, but beware it can be a bit spicy. It gives the chicken a bit of kick and a twist. It almost taste like a Thai lime sauce. The boiled bak choy comes with a fried shallot sauce, which just makes everything taste better. The squid with bean sprouts came with a Thai sauce and chili but it was not spicy at all. I suggest adding a bit of the chicken dip sauce if you would like a kick."

It continues to be a solid choice, delivering a solid consistently good, wholesome, flavorful, and traditionally authentic product.  So take away everything that's been written or said about Tian Tian in recent history and it'll stand on its own as a solid choice for chicken rice if you're in the neighborhood.  Is there a better chicken rice out there? Almost certainly, but that misses the entire point of a chicken rice stall in a food centre in Singapore.  At the end of the day, it's all about accessibility.  That these hawker centres were purpose-built to make affordable nutrition accessible.  That hawkers, over the years,  have devoted time and passion into making their offerings actually good is a wondrous unintended consequence of this most Singaporean of experiments.  So yes, Tian Tian is still good, pandemic or no, and hopefully will continue to be a solid go to option when wandering around Maxwell.  Do I think it's the best chicken rice in Singapore...for that answer you'll have to get to know me much better first."

We decided to go for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant, simply because of the many positive Yelp reviews and also the fact that the place was featured by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant opens at 10am and already there is a very long lineup.  Other places serves similar menu and gets only customers who have no patience for waiting in line.   Service was very fast, but do not expect too much, except having a chance to taste this famous dish as this a food court and tables are not necessarily spotlessly clean. I ordered 2 Hainanese Chicken Rice.   The cashier pointed to 2 vegetable dishes displayed as pictures on the board, cuttlefish sprout and bokchoy vegetables.  I ordered one of each, thinking that these came complementary as part of the menu I ordered. Had I known, I would have skipped the vegetables.   15 minutes later, I was walking away with my order. Bill comes to $18, being $5 for Hainanese Chicken and $4 for the vegetables. The chicken is very tender, so tender that it just melts in your mouth.  There are no bones and practically no fat.  But, frankly, I am more used to have chicken which has a bit of a bite.   There is a sauce that you get on the side that would spice the food up, but I find the meat to be quite bland without.  Very affordable, and worth a try."

I know other places I went to it was the same price but it was included with soup and veggies as well. This place just serves chicken rice and cucumbers. Nice and simple but I would have liked some soup on the side for a complete meal. Definitely worth the wait and the hype! Give it a try if you are ever in Singapore"

The chicken itself had decent flavor, though was a bit oily. The rice was fragrant and tasty by itself, and these tasted even better with some of the chili. I did feel that the portion was a bit small, so for many it maybe worth going for the large size. Although for $5 I really can't complain.Beware that the Hawker Center this place is in can get very crowded. I came on Saturday for lunch and all of the large round tables were completely full, so had to sit on a small table at the edge of the Hawker Center.

It's boiled chicken; honestly I think it's a cooking style that won't suit a lot of Westerners. It's more about textures rather than flavors. I ordered a large and it came with its own plate of rice. The chicken was lean with a bit of fat and the meat overall was soft and juicy. The skin was very silky and went well with the rice. Under was a layer of cucumbers, which to me was pointless.The highlight was the rice!

It didn't even make it to the top 10 best Hainan Chicken Rice I've had. First off, the chicken was ice cold. I understand that some place don't serve their chicken hot but having chicken that basically just came out of the fridge is quite unappetizing.

The drawback is the dish was just too oily for my taste and the chicken has a bit too much red meat (I personally prefer white meat chicken for chicken rice). The accompanying chili sauce helps give a bit of contrast to the oiliness but nonetheless not the best chicken rice in SG for me. We also tried the stall next to it (which is a spin-off from the original restaurant) - while the taste overall is similar, I do find Tian Tian's rice a little bit more fragrant.

Unlike other places that just serves their chicken plain, at Tian Tian they dress up their chicken with an awesome sauce that makes it taste velvety smooth. They also don't offer the typical chicken broth or ginger sauce but those aren't really necessary. The rice itself was fragrant and full of flavor, and the garlic chili sauce was just perfect with the right amount of heat.

It did indeed turn out to be too good to be true. Tian Tian's recent notoriety has enabled them to take over the stall next door solely for taking orders and handling payment so customers move assembly-line style down to the next stall to receive their order. It's efficient but not very friendly. The rice is the star - fragrant and flavorful. The chicken is really moist and works well with the chili sauce. Thick soy sauce is available too but you have to request it which you should. All in all, pretty stellar chicken rice."

As well, the chicken meat was super tender and juicy. It is always a pleasure eating chicken in Asia as it is much more naturally flavourful than the ones in America.

I don't know what that is but rather I delve in. It is past delicate and the skin on the chicken was extremely sleek. Once more, I was somewhat pestered by that thick covering.

While the rice is definitely soft and fragrant, the chicken was flavorless... and cold. I've never received chicken and rice in Singapore with cold chicken so assumed this was the specialty of Tian Tian, but aside from just being tender, there was nothing about the way this dish was served that marked it as something I'd come out of the way for. The second time I came here was out of my boyfriend's interest to try and had the exact same experience. Personally, definitely not worth the wait in the queue (although give it a try if you're lucky enough to not have to wait). I'd say you can very easily have a much better meal at another stall at Maxwell."

Disappointed, yes. Upset, maybe but never angry.While I know that food review sites and awards are always subjected to the reviewer's tastebuds, I never really thought that I would get so angry over a stall that doesn't deserve its award..... until today. For years I've been wanting to give Tian Tian Chicken Rice a try but could never bring myself to join the crazy queue. Than came Singapore's edition of the Michelin Guide and with a Bib Gourmand recommendation, the queues became even longer and after tasting it for the first time today....I can't help but think WHY? Tian Tian chicken rice lacks just about everything I would consider as a good chicken rice. The Rice.While the texture of the rice was fine, it was neither fragrant or tasty. It lacked the depth that a lot of better chicken rice places have. It didn't have that pungent garlic or ginger taste, or the umami-ness of the chicken stock used to cook the rice. While the colour looked on point, the flavours were severely lacking. The ChickenSeeing that it was our first time trying, we ordered a portion of white (boiled) chicken and a portion of the roasted. Portions were generous but the meat was overcooked and stringy. The white chicken didn't have the smooth, moist , juicy texture that help make chicken rice so famous. Instead, it was overcooked and stringy.The roast chicken didn't fair any better. Overcooked, stringy and the skin didn't offer any flavours to the protein. The only plus point was the sauce that was drizzled over the chicken, which was fragrant and tasty but even that could not offer any redemption to the overall disappointment to the dish. To the tourists that have tried it because of the Bib Gourmand, my sincerest apologies for not offering you the best chicken rice experience in Singapore and for those you are thinking about trying, please don't, there are better options out there. Michelin recommended? Better to rip that page out of the book."

I was impressed to say the least. Lemme just say, this place is hyped up but it's for a reason. This is a ~no-frills, order at the counter, sit down in the Singapore humidity~ and eat type of establishment. When we approached the stall, there was already a small line formed. First, you pay for your order then you wait as it's assembled.  I waited for about 10 minutes before receiving my food. I ordered a medium sized chicken rice, with the soy sauce and the spicy sauce. It.Was.INCREDIBLE. The chicken was perfect. I'm a big fan of big flavor, and I was a little surprised that boiled chicken would be so good. I mixed with the thickened soya sauce and it was heaven. The rice was fluffy and in the words of Anthony Bourdain ""absolutely fragrant."" and the cucumbers added perfect, refreshing crunch. I was STARVING on this day, and I just had to go back for seconds. I ordered myself a small size chicken rice this time, the cooks at the counter chuckled and said ""back for more?"" I said ""Its so good, can't stay away."" They had a hoot and I left absolutely satisfied.** As a tip; the small and medium sized are pretty much exactly the same. So save yourself a couple of SGD and order a small! You'll get the same amount. ** This place is delicious. An absolute can't miss in Singapore. Boy, wish we had this back in the States."

Only $4 for a chicken rice plate?! Although the portion wasn't that big, it was pretty filling and I felt kind of full with just one plate. It was probably the rice - which had a fantastic smell of chicken oil+coconut. The chicken however was just okay. It wasn't very tender and a bit on the dry side. But again the experience of eating the rice itself was so enjoyable that it added points to the chicken as well.I give 4 stars mostly because of the price and the rice. Quality of the chicken and the long line doesn't really justify it to be a 5-star restaurant. If I could go to Singapore again, this wouldn't be on my list of ""must-go"" restaurants but I wouldn't mind dropping by and grabbing a plate."

That said, the line itself, while looking a bit daunting, moves along relatively quickly - after all, how long can it take to serve a bunch of chicken rice? We ended up getting to the front of the line in about 20 minutes' time - not too bad - and we were served shortly thereafter. Unless you are really full already, I would go with a large, which, in all honesty, is not that large to begin with. Once we found ourselves a table, we chowed into the famous chicken rice - and in all honesty, it is pretty good, but it was not quite as 'amazing' as waiting in line might make you expect. The chicken is flavored well, although the sauce is a bit on the light side. I really do enjoy the cilantro here, but the quantity of leaves is pretty small. Speaking of quantity - the amount of chicken is also a bit less than I would expect, and with the pieces served with bones in them, you do have to work your way around it to get the meat off - no small feat when you have no napkins and no knives to help with. The rice is really well-flavored on its own - I could probably just eat that as a standalone - and the combination of the marinated chicken with the rice makes it easy to understand why it's so popular.So why the average rating? As I mentioned, the quantity of food was a bit low. For S$7.80, it's not a bad deal...but consider when we decided to give Tong Fong Fatt (a few stalls down a whirl)...it's no contest - their chicken is better, you get more of it (as well as soup), it is cheaper to boot, and perhaps best - there's no line. So despite the accolades that Anthony Bourdain and all the other testimonials say, the food here is certainly good - but it's not even the best version that is available amongst the rest of the hawker stalls."

I wondered how much the tourists in front of me paid for the similar looking plate of chicken rice. The cashier obviously know what she was doing.

I wish I could find a place this good in So Cal. But for the time being, I'll be drooling over this picture till then."

It alone has a line/queue. Apparantely Tian Tian has people waiting for its food virtually all the time. I visited during what I thought would be a between-meal lull in foot traffic, around 4PM, and sure enough there were still about 10 people waiting ahead of me. No other stall in the Center had a queue.The reason is obvious after you taste their Chicken Rice. How they infuse so much flavor into the chicken meat from a boiling/steaming cooking process is remarkable. The bowl of clear broth that comes with it has a similar flavor and is quite nice. The ""Vegetable with Oyster Sauce"" dish that I also ordered was surprising delicious: baby bok choy infused with thse same wonderful flavors found in the chicken. And all of it came to a little over S$6.00 (US$5.00) for food quality that many much more expensive Asian restuarants can't match.[A hint for fellow tourists: hawker stalls like this don't provide napkins, and to use the wash rooms to clean up will cost you ten cents (exact change helps). Also Tian Tian doesn't sell beverages. For something with an Asian flair that's easily accessible to everyone's palate I recommend the sugar cane juice from the stall directly across from Tian Tian]."

Singaporeans know their food and will never need your picture or ""approval"" to seal in the awesomeness of a particular stall.For example, I just look for a freaking line that is longer than your achievements and know that the food will be GREAT. Just like on the day that I binged on two orders of chicken rice to try both the roast and the standard steamed version...I tried the porridge with a line that took nearly 40 minutes before I got to order...that DIDN'T have your face on their stall.For the record, do us all non-fans of yours a favor before we bash you even more and tell the truth to your fans (such as my fair lady) that your ""approval"" of this stall is worthless because your opinion on Asian food (or all other local food) just doesn't count. Not to mention, if the crowd didn't boo you, I'm 100% sure you wouldn't have tried chicken rice.You fail.Tian Tian just WINS enough to grace you with their attention so you can make a buck by featuring it.Get a real chef job.Sincerely,ChickenRice-FanYelp 100: 24/100"

Worth the queue. 11/10 one of the best chicken rice vendors in Singapore, and perhaps the world.The rice is fragrant and fluffy. Not overcooked; you can taste and feel the individual grains as you shove each spoonful into your mouth - no kidding. The steamed chicken is flavourful, tender, and melts in your mouth. The chilli sauce (with ginger) complements both chicken and rice perfectly, adding a tantalising kick to every bite. And you have the option to order some steamed oyster-sauce veggies as a side, if you feel the need to be healthy amidst the amazing hawker fare in Singapore.All-round satisfying dish. Pair your chicken rice with 'sugar cane juice with lemon' (from any stall in Maxwell market) to make this the quintessential Singaporean meal.Side note: Drooling as I type this review. Need to planning my next visit to Tian Tian!"

This place is heaven. NO JOKE.I came to Singapore to eat. I wanted to try all the Hainan Chicken Rice out there. Before coming to Tian Tian, I had about 7-8 different Hainan Chicken Rice from places all over Singapore. Honestly, they were good, but NOT amazing. I got to the stall at around 11am. There were only a few people in front of me. For two people, we shared half a chicken and rice. THE CHICKEN WAS SO TENDER AND FLAVORFUL. AND THE RICE OMG. You can literally just eat the rice by itself. It was so fragrant. All the other chicken rice we ate, we ad leftover rice, but this place, we cleaned the plate in less than 5 minutes. ALSO, the SPICY SAUCE, is sooooo amazing. I love spicy food and it had the perfect kick. It was so good that we took two more orders to go with us to Sentosa to eat on the beach. Don't judge me! My only complaint is that the chicken had a lot of bones. Other places made it with chicken breast and no bones so it was a lot easier to eat and less fatty. If I ever come back to Singapore, it would be for Tian Tian, nothing else. I MISS IT ALREADY."

Hainanese chicken and rice is also very popular here and it's the place where I tried it for the first time. It's very delicious and very cheap in Thailand (it costs less than 2 US dollars).With that being said, I was really looking forward to trying it in Singapore, the home of this iconic dish.When I arrived, I was happy and sad to see a line. Happy because it means the food is great and sad because it means I'll have to wait.I eventually got it and I have to say, it's very good!!! But, I'll be honest, the Hainanese chicken and rice I've had in Bangkok tastes better. But the Hainanese chicken and rice in this restaurant is still great and it's definitely worth a visit when you're in Singapore"

Chicken was moist and flavorful as people say. Rice had good flavor as well. The sauce provided was good but I like the chicken rice meal on its own. $3.50 for a small. If you're with a group, order a whole or half and share. I'd say that other places are just as good without the hype. Also, then you don't have a wait even though this line at Tian Tian moves give or take quickly.

Tian Tian definitely lives up to all the hype. The chicken plate for $4 is amazing. I've never had chicken so juicy and tender and flavorful. Just from looking at it, you can see the plumpness of the chicken meat! You can actually taste the flavor of chicken. I didn't even use the sauces as the chicken itself is the star. I didn't want any sauce to takeaway from the star of the show. I really wish LA could get their hainan chicken act together, even something half as good as tian tian would be nice to have. And the rice is just heavenly. Rice itself is perfectly cooked: light and fluffy. The flavors of chicken have immersed itself into each grain of rice. Eaten together with the chicken, its like a party in your mouth. I went on a weekday around 2pm, so the line definitely died down. Waited about 10 minutes before I ordered, and another couple minutes to grab the plate of food. After you get your chicken, you can grab a drink at one of the juice stalls in the area (there's one directly across from tian tian). I'm salivating just writing this review.

You can probably request to not have the sauce.Also the soup was not provided till asked. Soup is very bland. The stall owner also requested for us to hold the plates in our hands instead of using the trays to hold the plates. (I went with a friend and we had bought 2 plates).

Having first tried the chicken rice in Chinatown, I had an ""okay"" benchmark of what it could be compared to. This little hawker stall (or rather two hawker stalls) lived up to the hype. The rice was flavorful, fragrant and indeed was eaten by itself for a few moments before realizing there was a half chicken waiting to be consumed also. Paired with the soy and chili sauce, the chicken and the rice worked together wonderfully, and left me to wonder if this was better than 53rd and 6th's own Chicken and Rice. My conclusion: it holds its weight. A must-try if visiting Singapore. Not just because a celebrity chef said so, but because food should be considered a way to get to know a new culture intimately.

The rice is cooked in chicken stock, it was infused, altogether cast over with lovely chicken flavour, so eating it alone brought a great pleasure. The meat was tender, was breaking apart by slightly being stirred about. Tender and juicy. Also, the ginger garlic and spice dipping sauce goes well with it.

We asked for a whole chicken thinking it would be small portions but the lady asked how many people will be eating. When we said two she said half chicken is more than enough. The rice is super flavorful! We ordered to go and the one complaint I had is they did not pack any ginger sauce. When I think of Hainan Chicken rice I think ginger sauce and yummy rice. For me the star of the dish is the rice. Need to add the ginger sauce. The chicken was juicy and tender. We ordered bean sprouts ans that was delicious!! It tasted very much like home cooked meal.

But nearly all of this type of chicken is just ok because it's all about the rice and sauce. The meat is smooth, evenly cooked, relatively clean (devoid of fatty sinews and bone spurs) for this type of chicken. The rice is very good, but not bursting with flavor as the pro chef's review suggests. Still, its soft, juicy, and fragrant. This stall's orange colored sauce is legitimately hot. Not as hot as something like, say, a Halal Guys red sauce in Manhattan, but still quite heated.  FYI: The Singaporeans do not seem to rock the ginger, green onion sauces that them Cantonese folks like.

Was shocked to see a long line to the counter and from what I heard from my cousin, that was quite typical of Singapore, especially the good ones.We waited in line and really hoped that the chicken rice would be worth the long wait. I saw a number of people walking with their chicken rice plates and quite honestly they didn't look appetizing at all.Finally got the counter and ordered their much famed chicken rice. They drop a bowl of rice on the plate, some sauce in it and chicken breast slices on the top, and a few slices on cucumber on the side.Would never imagine that something that looks so simple cab taste so good. Wow wow wow, I can't stop raving about this dish. It is so flavorful. Worth it, the long wait was totally worth it!!!"

The queue was pretty intimidating around lunch time but it moved quickly enough. The ordering process itself was bit of a nightmare. The woman at the till was very brusque and seemed more intent with moving me along. Understandable but in her haste, she ended up getting my order wrong and pointing me to the wrong collection queue (and then scolding me later for not being at the right one).All the logistics aside, the chicken rice was good but not amazing. My chicken was tender but there were way too many bones. The rice was fragrant but again, not unexpected with a chicken rice dish at most other stalls. You also have to order your vegetables separately ($4 for a plate that can be shared between 2) which was slightly annoying since most places do everything together for a cheaper price. Most of the people queuing up were also tourists which can sometimes be a telling sign as to whether a restaurant is more hype than substance. In this case, I am afraid it is."

Seems like they dictate the terms where you guys can or cannot taste their chicken rice!Seems over-rated to me after all. I came down on a weekday evening and was pleasantly surprised that they were still open at around 8. Proceeded to order a plate... and it didn't come with soup. The chicken is a little tough as compared to those I've eaten at other places. The chili however, is absolutely delicious. Not to hot and sweet enough for my liking. I went back to take another helping of it. Oh I didn't see them providing dark soy sauce too.The rice is absolutely normal. There were some cucumber hidden beneath the chicken.The experience was underwhelming and I'm sure the other stalls around like Ah Tai are already biting at their heels in contending for Chicken Rice hegemony."

I guess they can afford to as they are so popular.The food is chicken rice and I will admit that I do fail to see the greatness of this dish, although I have had a few decent ones.

I didn't really need to look up online to find out where to eat at the Maxwell Food center, I just needed to find the stalls that had a line and this one definitely had a line. I enjoyed the Hainan Chicken Rice here. Ended up ordering half a chicken and boy was it large in size. Usually when you order half a chicken, you'd be lucky that it would ever come in this size. This is probably a Chicken that was fed hormones/anti-biotics or something because it was huge. Usually organic/non anti-biotics chickens don't get this big so that's just my speculation. The sauce that was drenched all over the chicken might have been a bit much, would have preferred no drenching of the chicken, it didn't add much to the flavor and it just make more wet than it needs to be. The chicken was very tender and juicy both the dark meat and the white meat. Rice was very well done full of flavor. I would definitely come here again if I'm in Singapore again for my Hainan chicken rice cravings but sadly I don't think it's the best Hainan chicken rice I've ever had. I think places in Hong Kong did a better job. But regardless if I'm in the area, I'd still come back! and yes like all stalls at a Hawker center, it's cash only!"

The queue/line was long, even on a Sunday around 2:30, but moves relative quickly. And for $3.50 SGD, the chicken rice dish is probably one of the least expensive dish you can buy at this hawker center. And at that price, the serving portion (of chicken) is not particularly large... but you do get plenty of rice to fill your belly up. As for the famous chicken, the 6 or 7 slices are soft, moist and flavorful. Though I do wonder how much of that tasty flavor was from the broth they spoon on the dish before serving. I'm giving Tian Tian 4 stars... If this dish was served at another hawker stand, I would prob give it 3 stars. But eating out is never just about food alone, and factor in the whole experience of waiting in a long line along with everyone else ordering chicken rice...

I came down on a weekday evening and was pleasantly surprised that they were still open at around 8. Proceeded to order a plate... and it didn't come with soup. The chicken is a little tough as compared to those I've eaten at other places. The chili however, is absolutely delicious. Not to hot and sweet enough for my liking. I went back to take another helping of it. Oh I didn't see them providing dark soy sauce too.The rice is absolutely normal. There were some cucumber hidden beneath the chicken.The experience was underwhelming and I'm sure the other stalls around like Ah Tai are already biting at their heels in contending for Chicken Rice hegemony."

Not what I'd expect. Thumbs down on the rice for me... The chicken.... hmmm I found it to be course and dry in the breast area and the leg was nice and silky. I didn't mind it actually.

Before coming to Tian Tian, I had about 7-8 different Hainan Chicken Rice from places all over Singapore. Honestly, they were good, but NOT amazing. I got to the stall at around 11am. There were only a few people in front of me. For two people, we shared half a chicken and rice. THE CHICKEN WAS SO TENDER AND FLAVORFUL. AND THE RICE OMG. You can literally just eat the rice by itself. It was so fragrant. All the other chicken rice we ate, we ad leftover rice, but this place, we cleaned the plate in less than 5 minutes. ALSO, the SPICY SAUCE, is sooooo amazing. I love spicy food and it had the perfect kick. It was so good that we took two more orders to go with us to Sentosa to eat on the beach. Don't judge me! My only complaint is that the chicken had a lot of bones. Other places made it with chicken breast and no bones so it was a lot easier to eat and less fatty.

After 5-6 restaurants and stands at hawker markets and food courts, I was starting to think that my go-to Hainan chicken rice restaurant in Los Angeles is as good as it was going to get (other than the fact that the price in LA is higher than that in Singapore). Luckily, I marked up Tian Tian, which is highly regarded by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay, and made a point to come try this.WOW! The chicken was silky, clean-tasting yet flavorful. The rice smelled AMAZING and tasted even better. The red sauce added a special kick. My girlfriend and I devoured half of a chicken, and took 2 chicken rice plates to go!

It says that locals are still willing to brave the long tourist-enhanced wait for this chicken rice, despite being knowledgeable of the many alternatives. And indeed, this chicken rice is worth waiting for. There's not a whole lot of superlatives to add, except that you can definitely customize your order to include only leg meat, which I liked (I ordered 4 legs for my wife and I). Don't just order 'chicken rice' if you know anything about this dish and need to amortize your wait over more mouthfuls. They are also happy to give you as much chilli sauce as you might need. The meat is silky and well-seasoned on its own, but the provided chilli and dark soy sauce makes it superb! I am continually astounded by reviewers who don't seem to understand that in hawker food, the side sauces are essential additions, and not just for show, like salt and pepper on western tables. Combine with a mouthful of savory rice for a spectacular sensation. PS- there are lots of seats on the outer wings of the hawker centre, don't just look for them inside."

The chicken rice is alright, a bit greasy for my taste, and they tend to add some gravy-like dressing on it when served which I have to say definitely gives it a nice flavor boost. I have to say, though, that anything upwards of $5 is a bit steep for chicken rice which, yes, may have beat Gordon Ramsey, but what does he know about chicken rice?

So decide for yourself. I'm an expat in singapore and chicken rice tastes pretty much the same to me wherever I go, (its just steamed chicken and boiled rice in a broth sauce afterall lets not over glamourise it) so surely only real connoisseurs can probably tell the difference?

LORD OH MIGHTY - this is possibly one of the best Tapas meal I've ever had (NYC, London). Went on a Monday night and was expecting not very many people but the restaurant was almost at full capacity with mostly couples.   They had al fresco (or five foot way) dining and we chose that since it was a nice breezy evening.   Tremendous and excellent selection of Spanish wines - whites, reds, cavas, dulces, sherrys - I was dizzy with what to go with. If you are a real vino, this place is a real treat for you.  It also has an amazing selection of Spanish cheese (Manchego fans - this is your Spanish mecca in Singapore!)We started off with a Jamon (you must!) which literally melted in your mouth. You know it's well cured when all you taste is the sweetness of the cured meat (an amateur-cured Jamon will leave u with the slight smell of pork).   They have 4 Jamons on the menu - ask the server for recommendations.  I had a Chuletillas de Cordero (lamb chops) which is moist and soft. It was accompanied by Spinach and Chickpeas. Chickpeas were tender and creamy (how do you do that!) but  spinach was a bit skimpy so if you are looking forward to Spinach you may want to make a request to the kitchen for more. The Sardinas en Aceite de Oliva was also well done! Sardines didn't smell fishy at all (my friend was worried about that) and was succulent. And IF you like garlic, this is a wonderful dish as the masculinity of the garlic was brought forward very nicely by the sardines.Also had the Pulpo a la Gallega (octopus) - nicely laid out; once again, while its properly tender and soft (not chewy which is great), I had to work very hard at finding the natural flavour of the octopus. It's probably my least favourite dish.Will come back again. It's casually elegant and not pretentious at all. I also love the intimacy of the place. Pricey but absolutely worth the indulgence. Hands down my favorite tapas place in the world!"

The tapas, some authentic while some are a little modern, nevertheless they come across as very tasty. I had a Spanish friend with me (he's from Malaga, Spain) and he commented that the gambas here were among the best he has had in Singapore. To quote him: ""The food here is as good as I can get back home."" I guess this means it's legit.We ordered the gambas picante, which yes is very tasty. This was part of the seafood platter which included the octopus (which were super soft, tasty, and not rubbery), and the black mussels (which the gravy was such a heaven when paired with bread). We also ordered the lamb cutlets, which were very soft and delicious without any gamey taste.We also ordered the croquttes, which bursted of flavour when we sunk our teeth into it. I wasn't a big fan of the artichokes as I have a low tolerance of sour, but my friend loved it. We ended everything off with the mouth-watering flatbread with meat, which resembled some sort of pizza.After speaking to the waitress, she mentioned that this tapas bar is the sister restaurant to ""My Little Spanish Place."" No wonder the food seems authentic since they are known to have really good Spanish food as well.It's a pity that the overall dining experience was kinda dampened by the rowdy crowd outside where you'll find drunk expatriates looking for cheap drinks from their neighbors. I was told that this only happens on the late weekends, but if I come during dinnertime on the weekends, and also weekdays, it will be fine.One thing I'd love to try next time, will be the jamon. They have four different legs of Spanish ham, but as we were hungry we decided to go for the hot stuff. I hear they (and their sister outlet) are the connoisseurs of jamons in Singapore.Pros:- Very good food. My Spanish friend says it is!- Waitress is very helpful in advising our meal.- Sangria is amazing! Even though it doesn't have as many kind of fruits when compared to other restaurants, at least I can taste the wine in it!- Gin Tonic mixes are fresh and a great novelty.Cons:- Furniture not very comfortable. - Next door noisy neighbors (Drinks&Co) make dining there on a Friday less than classy.- Also thanks to the neighbors, drinks seem overpriced. But I guess when you compare it to other Spanish restaurants, it seems okay?"

I cannot resist octopus and the grilled leg was daintily presented and wonderfully smoky from the grill and tender to the bite. The croquettes were gorgeously creamy. Get the grilled sardines - lots of fiddly little bones but they were grilled so well that it made all the picking apart worth it. Smoky and rich, flaky goodness. A quick tip, order an extra basket of bread to sop up the sauces - you'll want to lick every single drop of sauce up! Between three of us, we had eight dishes plus a pitcher of sangria and it came up to a very reasonable $70 a head. In Singapore, that's not too much to pay for authentic Spanish tapas and alcohol. Will definitely be back again."

This must be my 4th if not my 5th time back at at The Coconut Club for lunch and I have not written a review for it. Maybe subconsciously I don't want to share this place with others. :-)Very popular place for lunch in An Siang Hill. The owner is meticulous about his source of coconut and that is clear when you taste the nasi lemak.  Menu is really simple. One main dish of nasi lemak with 2 pcs of chicken (breast or leg aka light or dark), peanuts, fried anchovies, fried egg sunny side up, crunchy cucumber slices and a spoonful of sambal chili.  Besides the main dish, there are lots of sides like otah and sotong(squid). The main dish is big and I hardly have space for the sides. A good plate of nasi lemak must be fragrant with coconut without tasting like you are eating coconut. Nasi lemak at TCC is very good. I love the chicken pieces. So tender and deliciously marinated with ginger and other spices. Every little side items are fine so well. The ikan bilis (fried anchovies) is crispy. The peanuts are just the right size. Only one thing I'm unhappy about. The side of the plate is too shallow. I kept pushing my food out onto the table. Maybe that's just me. Lots of drinks of local flavors to choose from. Homemade calamansi (lime), homemade barley, bandung (rose syrup with evaporated milk) etc. For dessert try the chendol. It is made with palm sugar and coconut milk. You can have it with it without red beans. Go for the red beans. Today they had a special coconut jelly dessert that is so beautifully done. Looks simple but tasted complex. The jelly is smooth not like agar agar. The coconut meat gave it a nice texture. Small dish big taste (of coconut of course)Definitely a place to visit but be here around 1130-1145. Past that it will fill up and if you have a party of 6, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes."

You can also ask for more rice as well!- Sambal sotong: This dish was basically chopped squid in the sambal sauce. Was a bit pricey and I wasn't a huge fan of the taste, so I would recommend just sticking with the Nasi lemak.Service:I showed up at 7pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty full, but it only took about 10min for us to get a table inside. The waitress was quite funny and also took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. The inside of the restaurant is quite nice and not too crowded, which made for a good dining experience overall.Price: $$Though more expensive that most nasi lemak places, still pretty reasonable at S$12.80 for the basic plate. I found this pretty filling, especially given that you can add more rice."

Of course, I still thought it was utterly overpriced, but for a nice restaurant in Club Street with a/c and yummy food? Aiight, I'll pay for it.I went on a Friday night and got a seat right away which is a nice change for Club Street that's always bustling and with people spilling onto the street. Service was fairly prompt, and it would have been nice to have the specials on the board instead of me having to ask if the menu was all there is to it and then the server then filling in the gaps on their specials of the day.I ordered the nasi lemak (of course) and the sayur lemak (which is apparently the less creamy version of sayur lodeh - it certainly tasted that way too) which was one of the specials. The nasi lemak came out looking delicious! The rice was coconut-y and fragrant, the egg was a nice oozy crisp, the ikan bilis was fried without being too hard, the chilli was a little too much on the spicy side (and just not as delicious as the one at Adam Road) and the chicken was glorious. The chicken was a full thigh and drumstick, was marinated in this delicious marinade (lots of local herbs - lemongrass and the like) and fried to juicy perfection. Yum. The sayur lemak had a really good broth - possibly ikan bilis? I made the unfortunate mistake of mixing all the chilli into it and ended up sniffling my way through my meal although it was really quite delicious. Although they also serve alcohol, my dining companion and I both got the lemongrass tea which was serviceable.This was all-in-all a very satisfying meal, and although I might still return to Adam Road for my nasi lemak fix (at a much lower price point too), I wouldn't say no to anyone asking me to get nasi lemak if I were ever in the Club Street area."
