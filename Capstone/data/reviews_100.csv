Just a heads up, it may be quite out of the way, but I think there are a few buses that go there. The space was really clean, big & bright; something I really appreciate in cafes mainly because I don't like  small spaces. We tried almost everything on the menu; would definitely recommend the soft shell crab burger (light and crispy!), crab roll (loveeeed the croissant; was super generous with the crab meat as well), and the pulled pork Benedict (my mum polished off her plate!)Their unicorn cake (coconut & mango) is a MUST have, and it's definitely one of my favorite cakes this year. It was really light and tangy. Would definitely come back !"

Had a nice brunch at this quaint place in the midst of an office campus. It was a good 10 minutes, unshaded walk from Tanglin Road into a mixed use campus. So on a hot day, that air con is gonna feel extra nice when you step into the cool dining room. There is also outdoor seating in the back but it looked like stuff was being stored there when I took a peek.The food was nicely presented but more importantly, it was very tasty and exceeded my expectations after having some disappointing brunches lately. The food quality was very fresh and appealing. Highlights were the fluffy scrambled eggs and the sweet cherry tomatoes served slightly grilled and still the vine. Service was good and prompt, but oddly the coffee ordered arrived halfway through the meal. The server did apologize for the delay and said it was ""due to the coffee being recalibrating"" ... I'm not sure what that meant, but it's quite possible I heard incorrectly. Nevertheless, great flat white. There's a little boutique shop in-house selling jewelry, clothing, and accessories that's worth a browse. Didn't get to try the selection of desserts, but the server did offer. It's going to have to be a rain check because there was just no more belly room."

Coffee was straightforward no complaints. Lychee tea was refreshing. Truffle fries served hot but not enough truffle. Some of the staff are young and inexperienced but quite eager to please which makes up for a lot.My 3rd time to this place. Friend's bday impromptu brunch. We were seated on the verandah out at the back and it was a warm day but we felt cool enough and it was nice to have the greenery. The odd ant but hey when in jungle, swing from tree.Bday girl Emma J and I got to the scene first. We ordered the truffled mushroom on house baked baguette and french toast to share. Mushrooms were great with creamy rich sauce, lots of truffle flavour and scent and the baguette looked homemade and was chewy, tasty with a darker brown crust than usual. This looked so good that our late-comer friends all picked from it.French toast - served with some kinda caramel sauce and chantilly cream. The cream held itself together well despite the hot day. The toast was a thick cut of brioche, I think about 5 inch square. The rest of us dipped the fries in the caramel sauce but Emma J was horrified. We all liked this.Truffle fries. Not much on the truffle flavour again but a generous portion served piping hot and crisp.Friend ordered the big breakfast - all commented that the croissant was much smaller than expected. It really was a mini croissant. But the brek came with 2 big juicy sausages. Perhaps they are going low carb...Personally prefer if this came with a good sized piece of toast. Eggs were nicely cooked, soft layered and seasoned just right.Breakfast mains mostly $19 to $21. We all commented that the food was tasty and seemed like quality ingredients. Pleasing and with some nice bits but I wouldn't travel far for it.We also ordered chicken wings to share - these came in a sauce that one friend described as zingy. Served hot, crispy - the sauce was bit spicy. Comfort food but yummier if you dip.Foam on my flatwhite was a little flat with some big bubbles so it didn't have that velvety smoothness that some of the serious boys and girls serve up. I think coffee for is me is a 3 or 3.5. But yes the free parking, breezy white look, bit off the beaten track and so near where I stay. If i need a quick cuppa, I would come..clearly I did.They serve a lemon meringue tart which I've had on my first visit but found it a tad sweet. Ok crust."

With Headchef Luca Beccali at the helm and a team of staff with great personalities, Basilico is a perfect place to enjoy delicious and fresh Italian buffet.When we think Italian, we will straight away think about the fresh produce that available in the country. Starting from seafood, meat, delicious cheese, salad, tomatoes and also olives. Basilico definitely tried to provide all those for their customers, including the remarkable list of Italian wine. Some the wines are also available by the glass.We were impressed with the food presentation especially when we saw the big island set up in the middle of the room. I walked around to see different types of cheese from soft burrata, to freshly aged asiago. Each cheese on display has the name, place of origin and information on which animal it came from. It was impressive, and I wish I weren't bound by time so I could try each cheese on display.Of course when we think cheese we will also consider the cold meat that we need. I stopped counting the amount of prosciutto and salami that I took. I wrapped some prosciutto on olives, mixed it with burrata and Roma tomatoes, as well as sweet cantaloupe. Moving on to seafood, even though there wasn't any Mediterranean water nearby, the quality of seafood at Basilico was really fresh. They have plenty of salad that can be mixed together with slices of tuna, salmon, and even lobster. I included some house-made bread and dips to complete the mini feast.Basilico also offers main dishes to complement your buffet. That night we tried the famous cheesy truffle foccacia, called 'Foccacina con Tartufo Nero e Robiola' in the menu. The well-flavoured foccacia was made in-house and served with generous amount of black truffle. I crushed the black truffle and spread it all over the surface of foccacia.Another dish that we enjoyed in the group is the Pentolone di Carne. It was served in a big pot and smoked with pizza dough on top. Underneath, there were tender lamb chop, pork sausages, grilled beef tenderloin, and some vegetables. This was only available until the 25th of September as part of Basilissimo Flavour of Autumn, so we were lucky that we were there to try it.Basilico also has its own dessert counter with gelati and beautiful house-made cakes. I was thankful that each cake was in a perfect bite size. I tried the Pistachio Cherry Mascarpone Mousse cake, Chocolate Mille Feuille with cute layers, Maple Hazelnut Financier and a small jar of Tiramisu (yas!).Basilico was chosen as one of the top restaurants in Singapore's Top Tables. We really loved the hospitality of each staff, the presentation of their buffet spread and the quality of each ingredient."

They are doing their best to provide this diversity, but if it's only a fraction of what it used to be. Quality of ingredients also seems to have gone down a little. Most importantly, the experience is less satisfying, mainly because the (otherwise excellent) staff are overworked with all the serving they now have to do. Requests are sometimes forgotten. There also seems to be an intended delay to serve the free flow wine in a cost-control effort? It remains very good quality, and decent value, however. During the week, many à la carte offerings are outstanding, like for instance an amazing carbonara."

I love Italian food, and they offer an antipasti and dessert buffet. The entrée portion of your meal is a la carte, and you can choose from pasta and meat dishes. I've been eating a lot of cheese and olives lately, but unfortunately these ang mo foods are very pricey in Singapore. You can only imagine how I felt when I saw an elaborate display of all of my favourite things (and more!) when I walked in. What surprised me the most were all the condiments they offered. Things like chilli honey, truffle honey, different types of salts, bottles of olive oils and balsamic vinegars... heavenly!Truthfully, I was disappointed in my main. I ordered the beef tenderloin, and I didn't like it much. I should've gotten Miguel's order of the risotto; it was also served with some fatty bone marrow, and it tasted so much better.For $88 per person, I found the dinner buffet value for money. I was only miffed that they charged us for tea at the end (without telling us it would be extra) and each pot cost $9! Additionally, we noticed that there were some chianti bottles open with some wine glasses on the table near by the open kitchen, which leads me to believe we could've gotten some wine as well without paying extra.

We were not prepared for a buffet. By which I mean I had had a hearty breakfast mere hours earlier. But refusing to be cowed, we soldiered on to tackle their spread.The spread was not vast but definitely more than sufficient. Their antipasti and cheese spread was particularly impressive with more than 10 types of cheese available with a variety of bread pairings. Predictably, as an Italian buffet, their main courses were dominated by pasta, pizza and red meat. The lamb crackling was a stand out for me as well as the gnocchi. We were also brought a special cheese stuffed pizza with hints of balsamic vinegar which was delicious eaten hot. The dessert selection was also good given the overall size of the buffet. None of the desserts were particular knockouts (not even the tiramisu!) but was sufficient to wrap up the meal nicely. Singaporeans who are used to the buffet scene here might be disappointed that some of the popular buffet elements have been opted out of here - no seafood or sushi for starters and no towering chocolate fountain. I particularly liked that they stuck to Italian cuisine and executed it with aplomb. Service was fairly good although towards the end it became a struggle to get our water glasses filled or get the bill for payment. Overall, a very good experience with RW."

Tucked away from the bustle of Orchard Road, on the 2nd level of Regent Hotel, Basilico offers a warm, soothing respite from everyday life. The entrance of Basilico belies the fact that it is actually a pretty big place which can accommodate about 200 persons. It is also not very noisy as the tables are placed in different sections, affording some semblance of privacy and cutting down the noise. There is also a private room near the wine cellar if you have a big group. I have found the staff to be very accommodating, thoughtful and helpful. We had the ""royal"" treatment on my first visit because of a friend's incident at the restaurant previously. The service recovery included the private room, glasses of limoncello for everyone, special food (e.g. grilled lamb chops, foie gras and a truffle bread thing) and a birthday cake as my friend decided to have her birthday celebration at Basilico despite the incident as she loved the food. But subsequent visits on my own with other friends have found the service to be consistently good. So it is not a one-off thing. Likewise for the quality of the food. Sunday buffet has a larger spread as it includes the foie gras, lamb chops and other stuff. Saturday buffet spread is also good enough with grilled meat station, pasta station, pizza, the awesome antipasti bar, dessert spread and a smaller selection of Asian food for those who just need to have Asian cuisine. What I like is the dinner where you get a choice of main to go with the antipasti bar and dessert buffet. The selection is not overwhelming but what they have is all of good quality. Quality over quantity. I love the duck rilette, selection of cheeses, truffle honey, chili honey, balsamic honey, truffle cream, truffle salt to go with the cold meat and seafood. Seared tuna was very nicely done, the Angus semi-rare beef slice was fabulous with the truffle cream. Parma ham with melon slice, pimento, olive dip, grilled vegetables and different types of bread were just so good.I could basically dine happily on just the antipasti and dessert. The panna cotta was creamy and excellent. Likewise for the bread and butter pudding. So far I love everything I have tried at Basilico. The mains were equally good, not overcooked or dried out. I will definitely be back when I am in the mood for good Italian food."

With six 5-star reviews, I had this bookmarked and knew I had to check it out. So tonight, as I went through my bookmarks again and re-read the reviews for this place, my mouth started watering up and before I knew it, I was dialing their number asking for a table for 3. When I got there, I'd realised I'd actually been there on two other occasions years back but hasn't recognized it on yelp nor did I remember the name (now thinking about it, it was probably because the food was forgettable) but even having had tried it, I was still excited as I didn't remember much from my past experiences. We went for the 3 course dinner set (which includes an anti pasti buffet spread, a main course you can order off the menu and a dessert spread)Like most of the other reviewers mentioned, the spread is not huge. And so I was prepared for that. But did quality make up for quantity? I didn't think so. Sure, they had ""expensive, high quality"" foods such as truffle oil, olive oils, seared tuna, aged cheeses, prosciutto, cold cuts, scallops, octopus salads for the anti pasti spread - but were they ACTUALLY high quality or just expensive-type foods? I believe it was more the latter. To be honest, there wasn't one thing here I thought was amazing. I mean, it wasn't bad, no. But I can't say it was that great either. The breads dipped in truffle oil / truffle salt was probably my favorite. However, everything else was ok. The seafood salads were bland, the prawn was not succulent enough, the prosciutto didn't seem fresh (seemed like it was bought at cold storage) and even the main course (I picked the Sea Bass with Mussels and Artichoke) was average. The saving grace for the night, the desserts. Almost all the desserts I had were good from the tarts to the cakes (loved the peach tart and lemon meringue tart in particular) and especially their gelatos!! Rich, smooth and super creamy, might have been one of the best gelatos I've had in Singapore.But all in all, for about $78++ per person, it was definitely not worth it. The ambience and service was good, yes, but if I'm rating it based on food, I definitely will not be back."

This is hands down one of the best buffets in Singapore, and one of the best Italian dining experiences.Being a buffet, it's really hard to breakdown what's good dish by dish. Let me put it this way however, there's free flow cured meats, free flow cheese (at least ten different types), a whole selection of olive oil and vinegars.I swear, there're few things that make me as happy as an endless supply of Parma ham. Salami. Of tasty cured meats and grilled vegetables. And while some people talk about how amazing the Bravissimo menu (where you pick you main and have the dessert and anti-pasti buffet) is, I'm more than happy to just take the anti-pasti buffet for dinner. Because everything you need to be all filled up is on that buffet... and who needs an actual main.Weekday lunches feature local foods, including surprisingly good roast pork, and there're expanded selections on weekends (Saturday offers free-flow Prosecco, Sunday, Champagne) in line with the Champagne brunches many other buffet restaurants offer. To really enjoy a meal at Basilico though, I'd highly recommend preparing your stomach from lunch. Eat a light lunch, maybe a salad, and just light snacks, and make sure when you sit down in Basilico, you're ravenous. :)"

I went there with my dad around 1pm on a rainy Saturday afternoon after making reservations. It was fun and the food was pretty good! We tried almost everything, since we are typical Singaporeans at a buffet haha. We split our order into 3-4 separate times, and the servers were quick and friendly. Sometimes I feel awkward for ordering a lot at a la carte buffet places, but definitely not here. Each dish is small with maybe 4-5 pieces. My favorites were *the gazpacho (very refreshing and tomatoey and each portion is in a little jug to be downed in 1-2 mouthfuls- I ordered maybe 5 of them)*the oven-baked eggplant in a casserole (this is literally an entire eggplant cut into half. delicious and chewy!!)*garlic fried shrimp (I LOVE the garlic taste, it had those fried bits too that were so delicious. Each order had maybe 8+ small shrimp)*asparagus rolled in bacon (what's not to like about asparagus and bacon!). The crab, scallop and avocado dip was also solid - I loved how it wasn't overly creamy or strong, and I could taste the little crab & scallop pieces. Strangely enough my dad was a huge fan of the scrambled eggs and ordered another portion. They seemed to resemble chinese-style scrambled eggs but were dry and fluffy. The chicken wings, meatballs, shrimp, etc were okay. Nothing wrong but nothing super impressive either. For desert, we tried both the orange cheesecake and the bread and butter: my dad loved the subtle citrus flavor of the orange cheesecake. I was pretty full by that time and they just tasted okay. 4 stars because I've had better tapas: the dishes were good but not mouthwateringly delicious. It's a great way to sample many dishes though, since tapas can get pretty expensive if you order individually. The Dempsey Hill area is really nice, albeit a little confusing - we drove around for a bit before finding Don Quijote, nestled further inside with a carpark right in front. The restaurant itself was a little dark, and there were around 2-3 other tables filled then. It had a very chill vibe - we, and the other tables, stayed for a few hours just eating and chatting. I'd love to come back to try their paella sometime, especially after reading the other Yelp reviews!"

Their half-a-decade tenure in the brutal F&B scene, where Spanish restaurants are a dime and dozen these days, is evident of their staying power, and their loyal following. Tbh, Don Quijote isn't the most outstanding or exciting of Spanish restaurants, but like that trusty beat-up Toyota Corolla, the fare here is hearty, rustic, and solid.  Still, Don Quijote is excellent in their treatment of seafood, so best to focus your orders on their seafood-based tapas.We had:1) Gambas Al Ajillo ($18): get the live prawns, as opposed to the regular prawns. Purportedly sweeter, these were lipsmackingly good.Highly recommended.2) Grilled Squid ($16): absolutely fantastic. Brilliantly cooked, with a smoky accent, this was a must-try.3) Chipiron ($15): perfectly tender baby squid cooked in its own ink, wonderfully nuanced.4) Tacos de Lomo al Queso Azul ($21) - tenderloin beef cubes with blue cheese dressing: The beef was cooked very well, and sauce refined, but even that couldn't mask the gamey taste of the beef.5) Paella Especial ($53 for small): commendable, but a tad forgettable. That said, the seafood was very nicely treated, and swimmingly fresh.6) Churros ($16): Delicious, these were crunchy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside"

Yes, it is at Dempsey Hill, which is an expat playground and despised by some because of that and the slightly higher price point of most places but after being in Singapore for some months, there are some days that I miss my home and this seems to hit all the right spots during one of those days.To clarify, I am not Spanish but I've spend many months as a young professional in Spain where I was involved in a project and whilst I disliked this project I found some comfort in the food and the warm culture and Don Quijote offers the same type of comfort. When browsing the menu, we asked the super friendly waiter (local, not Spanish and none of the staff speak Spanish) what paella size he would recommend for 2 and he told us that a small would do. So we settled for a small Paella Valenciana, a bottle of San Pelligrino (which is actually Italian but I consider that a detail) and two glasses of Sangria. I also appreciated that they ask you how you want the rice of your paella cooked.The paella is definitely a recommendation, it was fragrant and the rice was done perfectly (we asked for al dente). The typical crusty bits stuck to the pan made it a pleasure to scrape out every grain of rice. I was not super hungry so the small was enough to feed two people but I did find the portion on the smaller side and would recommend to add some tapas to make it a complete meal for two.Another big feature of Don Quijote is their outside seating, as it is located in Dempsey, it feels like you have escaped Singapore. After sunset, it has a cozy vibe, I really enjoyed sitting out there sipping the Sangria which by the way is not too special, average at best, but is a decent size glass so the atmosphere and amount of alcohol resulted me being in a forgiving mood.Would I return? Yes, I enjoyed the paella, liked the atmosphere outside and thought it was reasonably priced for Dempsey."

Really some of the best service I have had dining out on Singapore! 3rd star* The quality of food, the quantity of food, and the presentation were all top notch. The seafood was good but it was the meat dishes that were outstanding. Well, Except for the meatballs. They were moist enough but really, really bland. One miss out of twenty five dishes, that's pretty good!4th star* The never ending Sangrias here were so good. I have been to Spain, sat on the Ramblas, pounding down pitchers of Sangrias.

Wine selection was adequate and the cocktails good enough. The service--and we had two three-year-olds at the table--was understanding and on top of things. It's not five-star because it isn't fine dining, but it's great for a fun casual evening out. Bring the family and order some sangria!"

Their half-a-decade tenure in the brutal F&B scene, where Spanish restaurants are a dime and dozen these days, is evident of their staying power, and their loyal following. Tbh, Don Quijote isn't the most outstanding or exciting of Spanish restaurants, but like that trusty beat-up Toyota Corolla, the fare here is hearty, rustic, and solid.  Still, Don Quijote is excellent in their treatment of seafood, so best to focus your orders on their seafood-based tapas.We had:1) Gambas Al Ajillo ($18): get the live prawns, as opposed to the regular prawns. Purportedly sweeter, these were lipsmackingly good.Highly recommended.2) Grilled Squid ($16): absolutely fantastic. Brilliantly cooked, with a smoky accent, this was a must-try.3) Chipiron ($15): perfectly tender baby squid cooked in its own ink, wonderfully nuanced.4) Tacos de Lomo al Queso Azul ($21) - tenderloin beef cubes with blue cheese dressing: The beef was cooked very well, and sauce refined, but even that couldn't mask the gamey taste of the beef.5) Paella Especial ($53 for small): commendable, but a tad forgettable. That said, the seafood was very nicely treated, and swimmingly fresh.6) Churros ($16): Delicious, these were crunchy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside"

I've tried quite a couple of dishes from their mains and tapas menu. The calamari is a must order for me. The nicely batter fresh squid comes with a special orange tar tar sauce. I can't remember what's that really. Maybe it's a garlic aioli. The garlic gambas (prawns) are also very fresh and succulent. I love their paella which is done on the spot. Order this once you get there and start with other tapas while your rice is being prepared. Thumbs up for the squid ink paella. If you don't like your rice al dente, you can request for it to be cooked a little longer. Their al dente is a little on the cooked side.There are the red and white sangria available here. 1 glass to give you the giggles and 2 to remove your inhibitions. Enjoy!"

We ordered a load of tapas to share, and I thought the most unusual pick was the crab and scallop dip with toasties. Then again, you shouldn't miss out on the regulars as well, such as garlic shrimp, fried battered calamari, paella and the standard patatas bravas. If you can splurge, go for the Jamon Iberico - it's unbelievable how flavorful a few slivers of cured Spanish ham can get; a veritable samba on your palate. A jug or two of sangria wouldn't be too out of place here, but save some space for desserts as there are rather interesting items on the menu - notably the fried milk! It comes crispy on the outside and silky smooth on the inside; a weird kind of yum. Everything adds up quite steeply, and I remember my credit card smoking a little post dinner."

The chorizo, garlic shrimp,  and other standard tapas were as expected, so its a good place to go if you're just looking for the basics.The Paella though was awful, overcooked and tasted as though it had been sitting out for hours before it was reheated.What was worse was the service. The waiters hardly understood what we were saying, were incredibly slow in bringing out our order and had the hardest time splitting the check between two credit cards. They even came back after 30 minutes of failed attempts and said they didn't know how to do it and asked us to just use one.Overall the meal was just average, so I don't recommend coming here unless you're truly out of options or if everything else is closed."

Here is what we ordered:- Crab & Pork XLB- Vegetable & Pork Dumplings- Stir Fried Garlic Pea Shoots- Fried Rice with Egg & PorkTo start, I ordered their watermelon juice. It was a huge disappointment. Wasn't very sweet and I felt forced to finish it just because I paid for it. All the contents of the Vegetable & Pork dumplings were packed in pretty dense and it was DRY!!! Not juicy at all. The pea shoots and fried rice were delish, no complaints. I almost fell asleep waiting for the crab and pork XLB. The restaurant wasn't even crowded. Upon first bite into one of these dumplings, it was not the same as I remembered.

If you're really hungry, order from the ""snacks"" list which comes out quickly."

Waitresses and staff are all business - almost like non human robots. Very efficiently run chain restaurant. Diners mark selections on a clipboard either while waiting for a table or immediately when seated.  We go about once a month, all the locations are pretty consistent and we often tend to order the same things on each visit.  Sliced Cucumbers with Garlic, Xiao Long Bao,  Shrimp and Pork Dumplings, Shrimp and Pork Shumai, Pork Buns, Fried Rice with Fried Pork Chop, Wontons with Vinegar and Chili Oil are all extremely good.Today, we ate at the Resorts World Sentosa location.  It's a large restaurant and geared for the large groups and tourists.  Today, we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  The number display was broken so the hostess had to shout out the numbers in a shrieking voice that was as annoying as the sound of a very loud dial up modem (I'm telling you - they're all robots!)   I believe the prices here are a little higher for the tourists.  They also do not serve complimentary green tea after you are seated.  The food today was a little better than normal DTF quality - meaning it was excellent.There is often a wait for a table so the trick is to arrive early before the peak rush. They open an hour earlier at 10am on weekends.  Din Tai Fung is a great place to bring out of town visitors for dim sum.  Even the most constipated westerner will find this food appealing."

Far better idea to enjoy the delights at Malaysian Food Street next door, especially if is a warm or balmy day since the air-conditioning is just right. Or try something in the food stretch - Bali Thai and Ruyi sound good. Else maybe just go back into town to DTF at city hall, paragon (my favorite decor) or Wisma. If you do decide to stay, wait patiently and try get a seat in the much more pleasant dining area that is further inside and has more windows and open space.

Hands-down, most luscious pork slices ever. Despite the modern ambience, the curries aren't watered down, and they pack quite the punch.2) Deep Fried Pork in Garlic & Pepper ($30): robust, fragranced with copious lashings of black pepper and golden nubbins of fried garlic.3) Massaman Beef Curry ($34): redolent of nutty elements, and loaded with roasted potatoes and fork-tender beef hunks.4) Vegetarian Tom Yum Soup ($22): fiery despite its clear countenance, chunked up with an assortment of enoki, oyster, shimeiji, and straw mushrooms.5) Phad Chee Aiw ($16) - thick flat rice noodles with dark soy, interspersed with pork, eggs,  kailan, and carrots: superb"

The salted caramel sauce interestingly gave it a distinct salty taste. No wonder it was the most popular item on the menu. Another fact about the brownie was that it was so dark in colour that it looked almost black. Totally different from the usual brown coloured brownie which I was expecting. The owner shared that it was made with extra dark cocoa that was similar in colour to oreo cookies, which was why the colour was like black in colour.

Not because it is Vegetarian, just because the stall is small. Actually the people at this stall are also less friendly than the Andhra Curry. Comtech has a large indian working population and they form around 30% of the diners at the foodcourt. Since there are only 2 stalls and Indians do like to eat Indian food, you can guess the queues are pretty long. The line of Indian Vegetarian seem to move faster though.

I'm not sure why people would classify the restaurant as pricey when given the quality of the food, portions, decor and service, it really is the farthest thing from pricey. If one refers to the absolute price of the food, I think its a foregone conclusion when eating fine dining anything. Unless you catch your own abalone and other treasures yourself I guess... Anyway if that prevailing view works in my favor i.e. less people fighting for good seats in the house, I'm all ears :PWe had one of the set menu's (can't remember if it was peony or jade or something) and extended it to 8 people and swapped one of the dishes. It worked out to about $110 per person and we got:- suckling pig AND roast duck for starters- a brimming bowl of treasures each (diced abalone, ham etc soup with a very generous chunk of bird's nest on top)- broccoli with plump and juicy scallops kissed by XO and dried scallops- the best salted egg yolk prawns with asparagus - crunchy and rich without being overwhelming- a very fresh and large steam soon hock- light, but flavorful glutinous rice...annnnd nian gao + one of those light herbal jelly/aloe vera type desserts to finish the feast. That's quite hard to beat. Barring some annoying tables nearby that were a tad loud, we had a very enjoyable meal and service was unobtrusive."

I have nothing bad to say about the food. The seafood was fresh, veal meat was tender and the birdnest just melted in my mouth! Love every bite of everything. Portion was just nice for us, if not a bit too much. They also have dim sum in the afternoon, for those who want some Chinese afternoon tea.Service was excellent. While it is a Chinese restaurant, they assigned an English speaking staff to us without prompting - most likely because we made our reservations in English and they took note.

This is it! The name may not give you a clue that this is an Italian restaurant, but what they do here really impressed me. I'm not expecting amazing pasta when I'm thousand of miles away from Italy, but watching these guys hand make the pasta every single morning made me wonder: why the heck did i not come in any sooner?!!Our pappardelle pasta was well made with Italian sausage and mushrooms. It's seriously the most simple thing but that BUTTER SAUCE is everything! We had a simple salad of romaine lettuce, corn and olives beforehand so we don't feel too guilty eating a rich entree. And no Italian meal would be complete without a luscious Panna cotta. It passed the wiggle test so it was legit as can be. My Negroni cocktail (S$14 with Tanqueray) was nice and strong, just how I like it. And that pricing is at par with SF than the usual astronomical prices they charge for alcohol here. I'm a happy camper. If they improve their service, I'd happily be a repeat customer."

I'm not a culinary expert and I was quite excited to try this after a few recommendations. For the price and good reviews, it really was a disappointment. Pros: ambiance/decor, location (for a nice area out), nice staff (albeit they were not flexible given they put in the wrong order/details twice and charged us fully for it anyway). We ordered standard items thinking it would be a good place to start: chicken enchilada (but we received the crab enchiladas and kept it to avoid more delay), sink burrito (no chorizo but was given chorizo anyway), and vegetarian nachos.- crab enchiladas: filling was barely cooked together with fairly raw onions and almonds. The sauce was asian tasting, not deep tomato-y and chili based. The tortilla was terrible. It was a blue corn tortilla that was so paper thin it served almost no purpose. The side of black beans tasted just like black beans no other flavor. It should include onion, garlic, salt and cumin notes. - the everything burrito chicken tasted boiled and tough with no seasoning. They wrapped it open ended maybe for a different plating but the filling then spills out and isn't densely packed abd integrated. Honestly the best part was the picked jalapeno & the shredded beef was ok. Usually you get carne asada for such a burrito.- nachos we're just so-so. I had hoped for thicker style chips, a punchier queso sauce & quality toppings but everything was mediocre especially the guac which didn't have cumin, garlic, cilantro coming through. = 104 SGD. I'd be fine if it were actually good given Mexican food is rare here. It was a steep price for quality. Go for the area/atmosphere and probably the margs, but keep your food orders minimal. Sad. :("

Then, right after they bring us the bill--unasked for, and even before the dessert (which we had already ordered). And at 10:29pm they ask us to leave, all other tables had left already. Not just ask us to finish drinking, as the current rules require. At 10:30pm, while we are leaving, a group of safety inspectors walks into the restaurant.

We had nachos with melted cheese, with a hint of chili. It was warm, tasty and a good portion  for 3-4 people. The chicken taco salad was OK,  but the Christmas special menu item crab au gratin was delicious. It came with tortilla and a sauce that tasted like olives.

Throughout our meal, the staff was friendly but rushed.  For this, I have deducted one star from their overall review.The ambiance is great. I actually really liked the room.  It has very high ceilings. The earthen tones make for a warm inviting environment.  There are lots of paintings on the wall.  It would be a great space for a party.tinyurl.com/bayzxalWe each ordered a cocktail.  I had a frozen lime margarita.  She had a frozen strawberry daiquiri.  My margarita was a tad on the bitter side.  Outside of that, it reminded me of a margarita made with basic margarita mix.tinyurl.com/bx6ezg6tinyurl.com/as8a663The food was average to relatively good.Chicken Fajitas -  I could almost cut and paste my review of the steak fajitas from La Salsa.  They were very generous with the chicken.  It did come on a sizzling platter.  The seasoning seemed like something straight out of pre-made spice mix.  They were not nearly as generous with the condiments.  Plus, these also appeared to be straight out of cans, jars, or bottles.  The guacamole had no texture to it.  The salsa was no better that Tostito's.  They did not provide beans or rice.  If you are going to charge $30+ for chicken fajitas, they should darn well come with beans and rice.  The tortillas were well heated.In the end, these were decent fajitas.  If the salsa and guacamole had been better, it could have made a big difference. tinyurl.com/a6h7mohCondiments:tinyurl.com/balvrr8Margarita Chicken - My dinner date ordered their Margarita Chicken.  I did not try it.  The dish look pretty appetizing.  She enjoyed it.tinyurl.com/aqqova8Receipt (Dinner for 2 - $110.64):tinyurl.com/b5us2cfOverall - Rushed service led to a rushed dining experience.  Nice spacious room.  Large US chain-level quality Tex-Mex food.  If you really have a hankerin' for some Tex-Mex or pseudo Mexican food, they will do.  So you do not get rushed out the door, I suggest going well before 10 pm."

Parking was alright as there were still empty spots when I arrived. It will be more crowded around 7pm on weekdays and no doubt on weekends.It is my first time eating at a Mexican Restaurant in Singapore so I can't really compare yet (more reviews for the ones in California).When My aunt and I stepped indoor, there were reserved signs on most table. The servers did not really hear us out on wanting the indoor seat and had to repeat ourselves for three times before they gave us a corner table for two.Looking at the menu, there were a range of choices. I looked into the burrito section and spotted beef chimichanga. My aunt ordered something else.For drinks, I had a strawberry jarritos. Missed this soda ever since I stepped in Singapore. The food came 15 minutes later and came in a big portion. I was amazed at the portion and expected a smaller portion for a huge price ($18). The tortilla outside was crispy. The black bean with cheese was delicious but there are too much chunks of shredded beef. On my plate there was a side of rice and a side of cabbage/lettuce. The portion is too big for the taste. I would prefer less meat to savor the sour cream and the avocado instead. (1/2 star deducted here).We called for checks and it came to a more shocking amount. 7% gst, 10% service charge. In the end two meals, two drinks added up around $70+. I think that they need to cut down the price. (This is why 1/2 star is deducted).Overall it is alright to go there once awhile. But since there was no other reviews i was not sure what's good here."

We had to send it back to be cooked more (I.e., we had wanted medium, had to go well as the meat wasn't good enough for well). Service was quite slow, with them not checking on our meal or refilling water. I ordered ice water, and water came without ice. Took over ten minutes for the check after we requested it. Ambience was nice. Will try again, curious about burritos and fajitas."

Sauce for both red and green enchiladas was in desperate need of chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder to add flavor. The red sauce was simply puréed tomatoes (seriously...it was that lacking). Luckily, the meat (both chicken and beef) was good...not great....but good and not dried out, so the meal was edible.  Side rice was not Mexican or Spanish or Latin in taste.  Sadly, the best part of my meal was the side of black beans. For a minimum of S$18++/a dish I would expect higher efforts.  If they hadn't put a couple slices of jalapenos on the top, the dish would be totally lacking in flavor.  If the restaurant would simply invest in a few spices (go on and add it to the guac too...it sure needs them), the meal could be WORLDS better.   I admit that it is hard to find authentic Tex-mex here in Singapore, but pretty much every other place I have tasted on the island is better.  I didn't opt to try the margaritas (wow...highway robbery).  I will make my own at home!"
