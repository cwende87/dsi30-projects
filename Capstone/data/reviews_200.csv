Once inside, the decor is good enough. The beer list is fairly long and they do offer ""sampler sets"" but they are large 6-8oz pours at S$14 per set. They definitely should make them smaller and perhaps offer a set of five. Just a better business model I've seen work some many other paces. The food was fine. They definitely specialize in beef and the proportions to price were less than appealing. While understanding Singapura is expensive, it seemed a bit overpriced for the ambiance (or lack there of), while watching patrons from a nearby gym club swim in the pool just on the other side of the windows. Definitely a step down from their previous location in/near Katong. While I wasn't aware of them there, it seems like it was a much better location for attracting customers. Oh well."

The toppings were great, it's good to see places take risks with a bit unconventional toppings.  The only thing lacking was the sourdough crust.. it was a tad undercooked. For a pizza oven, it probably meant spending just 30 seconds to a min longer in the oven. APart from that.. its a decent pizza place."

You can't go wrong with Brewerkz located in the middle of Sentosa Boardwalk.We chanced upon it while walking back to mainland after a day in USS. Despite my headache, I agreed to 'seize the moment' and stayed in to have a few beers and snacks. The drinks were the same as you would get in bars anywhere else and not exceptional (about 16 for a beer), though some of them are from their own microbrewery. The snacks were also unexceptional but definitely satisfactory. The onion rings were $9 for a fairly large basket, and desserts of brownie with ice cream and bread pudding with ice cream were $10 each with equally decent portions. The best part is the view, which is really what you're paying for. The sparkling lights on the floor to mimick the night sky above coupled with the serenity of the sea and the distant twinkling of the cable car lights was a simply divine combination. At 9pm, we were unexpectedly treated to some sort of light show in the distance of a floating platform in front of Sentosa. I'm guessing many already know about this but it looks like two birds fighting and ended off with loads of water, light and fireworks. From our location, it was perfect, not too loud or crowded, and with the soft backdrop of the bar music. We had actually just paid and were about to leave for the bus home but were mesmerised by the fireworks and abstract lights.This is a very romantic location to bring a date, or just a laid-back environment to chill with friends."

They use real charcoal so you get a much better flavor than with a gas grill. And they cook the meat for you! For six people, we ordered:1. Thin-sliced brisket (WooSamYeop) 28 SGD x 2. Would definitely order this again, and again and again. The brisket was subtly marinated and cooked to crisp perfection. 2. Yangnyum Galbi 45 SGD x 2. Would also order this again. It was a fantastic flavor. 3. Marinated pork belly (Mansinchang) 25 SGD. Also delicious4. Premium beef (Ggot Sal) 38 SGD. Again, very tasty. I found this and the Galbi to be pretty interchangeable?5. Jap Chae 23 SGD. Christian loved this dish. I think he finished it single-handedly. 6. Dolsot Bibimbap 15. Very reasonable price for dolsot bibimbap, but an uninspired interpretation. 7. Seafood Pancake (Haemul Pajeon) 22 SGD. Much eggier than the versions that I'm used to. I didn't really like this and wouldn't order it again. 8. Sundubu Jigae 18 SGD. We barely touched this and I definitely wouldn't order it again.There's not a wide variety of banchan, but you get a lot of veggies. Next time, I would weigh much more heavily towards meat."

I love beef but for most of my friends who can't eat beef for religious purpose, it's a bummer. It's been a while since I've been here but since I was in the vicinity and craving army stew for a long while, we decided to head over there.Verdict:- Army stew (contains beef broth and pork) - This is delicious except that I found the soup abit lacking in taste, to which I added some soyabean chili paste. Yum! The stag will thoughtfully put a pot of soup on your table in case you need to top up the soup, which gets thicker and spicier as it boils.  - Woo Samgyup - This is their trademark beef with marinated sauce. Guess the trademark comes from the secret sauce recipe. The beef is tender and juicy yet thin. It's like shabu beef on grill! - Pork belly grill - This is awesome as always; well marinated. But I found the fats pretty daunting so I stuck mostly to the beef! Total bill came up to $100 exact! How often is it you get a whole, round number? :) All in all, I was amazed that the staff grilled the meat for you which could be a Singapore thing. However, if you go to other korean restaurants at Tanjong Pagar, some of them let you grill the meat yourself. That's the fun part I feel!Tip: Go there early for dinner as the dinner crowd starts streaming in from 630pm. I was there at 530pm and got a nice seat quickly."

The meat was amazing and when I wrapped it in lettuce with a bit of shaved green onions and sauce it was even better. This was my first time having Woo Samgyup, and I have to say that I will definitely have it again. The only thing is that aside from cooking for you at your table, the servers don't really stop by to check up on you."

The waitress cooked the meat, so we dont have a chance to slow down our eating speed, and i wasnt allowed to put garlic on top of the grill. Sad! I love eating meat with grilled garlic.

When I saw the long queue outside and the abundance of tables inside when I enter, I was surprised and thought it must be an awesome marketing strategy! To make you feel like it's very popular!But I can't blame them, during our meals, the servers have been very dedicated to help us grill our meats that they are probably quite shorthanded.Service-wise, their servers literally stood beside my table and cooked the meat well for us, leaving us to fully enjoy our meal. Tea however was often not refilled, and I don't like that they use plastic containers for the tea. As for the food, the kimchi soup is nice and authentic, but a little too spicy for me. For each time we visit, always loved them serving the long row of vegetables that are so fresh, crunchy and so... green!Each time, I ordered only two sets of meat for two persons to share and couldn't finish it. Tried their five spices marinated meat, pork belly, the first page highly recommended beef and the premium beef set.

Located at the basement of Vivocity Mall, this branch of the ever popular Akashi chain of restaurants possibly has the best location out of all the Akashi restaurants. It is easily accessible because of the Harbour Front MRT station, and being located in a mall by the sea allows one to take slow leisurely walks to fend off the post dinner coma. The sashimi here is cut lusciously thick; the katsu is addictively crispy on the outside, and sits on a bed of fluffy white rice. Prices are pretty reasonable too, as with all Akashi restaurants. I recommend calling ahead though, because this branch can get quite crowded at dinner time."

He also enjoyed the Sweet potato fries that accompanied the burger! Honey Baby Back Ribs - my FIL enjoyed his the most he declared. I tried a bite and the meat was moist yet falls-off-bone tender. Seasoning also on point. Mad about Salmon - MIL said it's nice. Salmon meat was not dry and Rosti was great too. Beef Mac & Cheese - daughter didn't like the shell pasta but she still polished the whole tray of baked pasta! Haha... the sauce base is tomato with cheese over it. Think it's more lasagna than Mac & Cheese really. BBQ Cheeseburger - this should be good because my 8 year old ate the WHOLE burger unassisted!

Being established in 1977, they are located at Keppel Road, sitting on top of a grain silo, serving Beijing Cuisine as well as dim sum for lunch. Having visited 4-5 times here on Business Agenda, this place and her food had never failed to entice me.Locating the restaurant may be a little tricky as a miss in a turn will make you go a big round to locate it. Since its located within Prima's premises, parking lots are rather limited. However, valet services are provided for diner, thus one do not have to get stress out of parking lots.Once entering the lobby area, diners have to take the lift up followed by a flight of winding stairs to reach the 11th floor then escalator. Interior is in line with the old school traditional vibe with rosewood furnishing, fish tank, round tables with lazy Suzy and square tables. Atmosphere is like tuning into a time machine, going back in time into 1980s.The entire one round of revolution takes about an hour and of course the best seats are by the side of the windows offering a panoramic view to the surroundings to the PSA and Sentosa Island.On our visit, we had the Menu 5 for 6 persons instead of ala carte.Shredded Scallops with Fish & Egg White is one of Prima Tower's Signatures. The dish was served with ingredients segregated, thereafter the server will perform the mixture of egg, egg white, fish and scallops in front of us.Shredded Scallops with Fish & Egg White 赛螃蟹Despite of the dish name in Mandarin that mentioned crab, there was no sign of crab as an ingredient. The combination of ingredients blend well into one another which is sweet and delighting to our palates, very suitable to start off our meals like this. To enjoy this starting dish, add some black vinegar and pepper for taste.2nd dish on the menu was Fish Maw and Seafood in Thick Soup. Similar to the 1st Dish, we added vinegar and pepper for taste. The serving is prepared in personal potand the thick soup too, was fresh and refreshing.Fish Maw & Seafood in Thick Soup 鱼鳔海鲜羹The legendary Chinese Dish - the Peking Duck. Glistering Peking Duck will be parked by a side on a trolley waiting to be carved by the skillful waitress / waiter. If you are wondering where does the rest of the meat gone to after having its skin encased in the egg wrap. Well, the meat can be used as ingredients for other dishes such as fried rice.Authentic Barbecued Peking Duck 烤北京填鸭We have ordered egg wraps and staff will fill the wrap with the crispy duck skin, spring onion and bean sauce.Soon Hock Fish was served in Teochew style with light and tasty broth. The meat was tender and topped with garnishing like coriander and chilli stripes.Steamed Soon Hock in Teochew Style 潮式蒸顺壳Another dish that struck me by surprise will be their stewed pork ribs that was served separately with buns. In Dialect, Hokkien language, we called this ""Kong Bak"" where by this braised meat was sandwich in between the pieces of fluffy buns. In this case, its more of pull pork. The meat was fork tender and easily fell off with little force asserted.Stewed Pork Ribs (Served with Buns) 京烤骨皇 （代花卷）These pork meat was very flavorful in its generous serving of braised sauce with a few stalks of coriander to enhance its taste. Having said that, the pork was not greasy at all.The buns that come in a set with the Stewed Pork are fluffy and looked different from the usual ""flat pouches"" kind of bun we had from else where. Instead, these came in shapes and had some lines patterns on the surface.Soup was sweet and delighting with Chinese spinach, shredded scallops, wolf berries in superior broth.Chinese Spinach with Shredded Scallops, Wolfberry & Whole Garlic in Superior Broth上汤蒜子干贝杞子灼苋菜An ending surprise with souffle balls encased with red bean stuffing. Even though it was fried, exterior was not greasy and amazingly soft. Initially we thought desserts was fish balls but the skin was soft, taste of egg white and chewy.Souffle Balls with Red Bean Stuffing 高丽豆沙I love its texture, also given that the red bean stuffing was not too sweet.And just this month, we visited in smaller group and ordered Menu 4.Menu 4A popular delicacy in a Chinese restaurant whereby sharkfin was flavored in stock. Soup was great with ingredients like Fish Maw, crab meat, fish and chicken.Braised Shark Fin Soup with Seafood 海鲜鱼翅Enhance the taste of the delicacy by adding black vinegar and pepper."

There's a current Peking duck and seafood special that is a really great deal at just $288 nett for 10 persons. Really enjoyed the shredded scallop and fish in egg egg whites. It was just so delicate and light but you got the full flavor of the seafood. Same applies to the broccoli & crab dish. The fish maw & seafood soup, the Peking duck, and the  sea bass were pretty good too. I found the stewed pork to be on the fatty side and didn't really care for the jelly desert. Still all in all, it was a very delicious meal and since we added some dim sum to the menu, we were stuffed and satisfied. Service is efficient albeit a little curt. Still, you get lovely views of the city as you go through your meal and that compensates for a lot.

At 37 years old, Prima might be the oldest revolving restaurant in Singapore. It is also, according to them, the only revolving restaurant situated on top of grain silos in the world. It's a good thing I only read that after lunch because under the right conditions, flour can act like explosives. Erm. Right. On to the important stuff--does it revolve? Yes! So you get a nice view of Sentosa-Keppel-Mount Faber-Telok Blangah and back again. It moves slowly, say 30min for one full rotation, so unless you're very sensitive no one will lose their lunch. Today being a public holiday they were full house for lunch; I heard that this place usually serves the lunch crowd, but best to call ahead in any case. We had the set menu (which was on promotion) so it worked out to under $30/pax, including the nommy Peking duck. Many other families also thought it was good value and ordered that; however, Prima also has an extensive dim sum menu that other tables were ordering from. I am going to return to try that out! Food was tasty (Beijing cuisine, the menu said; old-time flavours, the aunties said. ), service was prompt (never had to prompt for tea, food came out at a comfortable pace, only had to wait for dessert but that was when they were at their fullest). So. Yes. Come for the novelty, and enjoy a good meal with it!"

It is pretty easy to get a reservation on Chope, or even as a simple walk-in on a busy Friday night in Sentosa.My first impression was thinking...this is definitely one of the least attractive spaces to label as a Michelin Star (that is, one that isn't a hawker). It looked like a normal cafe with an identity conflict being casual vs dressy. However, my mind changed pretty quickly when I encountered the impeccable service from the very beginning. The hostesses are amongst the kindest and most professional I've ever come across in ANY restaurant. I was quickly seated and provided the giant one page menu and their drink menu which was mostly French and Australian wines, with a lacking cocktail menu. The wine sommelier (quite a young sommelier for a Michelin Star restaurant) assisted me in selecting a bottle of Australian Shiraz which was actually also their house Shiraz and quite good. I ordered the following:1) Truffled Kalamata Olive Flatbread - They served this with a Pistachio butter that came in what looked like a toothpaste tube which was slightly unattractive. The flatbread was a nice starter.2) I unfortunately don't remember which steak I ordered but it was the recommended Australian steak. It definitely was not presented well but had a great flavor that I truly enjoyed. They give you two small beakers with a sesame sauce and some other sauce that you can play with along with three side garnishes to enjoy. The meat was extremely soft and flavorful.3) Hot Chocolate Soup for dessert - This was their recommended dessert but I can't understand why. You are literally served a cup of hot chocolate sauce (similar to the lava from a Chocolate Lava Cake) and a cup of vanilla ice cream. That's it. It's as if I was drinking a rich hot chocolate with a side of vanilla ice cream. Very unoriginal and I felt ripped off by this.Frankly, although this restaurant had good flavors and solid service, I scratch my head thinking how this was awarded a Michelin Star. CUT at Marina Bay Sands is lightyears ahead of OSIA (my opinion) with regards to flavor, drinks, wine, ambiance, everything and that is what you would actually be comparing in the same category. Michelin aside, it's good although not entirely memorable.However, if you are on a Michelin Star hunt, extremely hungry for steak and stuck in Sentosa, then I would definitely recommend OSIA."

It's a good starter for those with smaller appetites, because it leaves space for the heavier stuff.We also shared a seafood platter; grilled octopus, King prawns, scallops, a half lobster, and a small bowl of clams in white wine. They paired it with a side of hollandaise sauce & cocktail shrimp sauce, which were both really good!For desert we had the macadamia soufflé - the portion was huge, and it was really tasty!

Fresh, clean flavours abound, and cooking styles were deliberately kept delicate. Perhaps it's the lack of a dining crowd during lunchtimes, but Osia's set lunch menu, at only $45 for a 3-course set ($35 for 2-courses), is probably one of the most value-for-money ever. A competitively priced set lunch in order to draw in the customers, I supposeService was excellent at Osia. I'd gotten terribly lost in the labyrinth of a carpark and was an angry mess by the time I arrived at the restaurant, but the waiter was so empathetic, so cheery, downright nice, that it wasn't long before I cooled down. And despite a couple of serious cock-ups (the restaurant's power tripped which caused the credit card facilities to fail, so after 20 minutes of trying to swipe our cards, we were then told that only cash was accepted, and there was this faint stench of the sewage that reeked through the restaurant towards the end of the lunch dining hour), service recovery was fantastic. Apologies were profuse and sincere, and reparation efforts were made to provide us a better dining experience by way of a discounted return visit. We had:1) Mixed Flatbread ($11), a chewy confection burnished half with Truffled Kalamata Olives and the other half with Macadamia Pesto.2) A starting option on the set lunch menu, the Black Angus Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio, dusted with dukkah spice and topped with creamy egg mayonnaise: scrumptious.3) Cardamom Citrus-Cured Yellowtail Amberjack: another starter, crisp and refreshing, complemented by the mild sweetness of fennel and the fruity bite of a thick orange-ginger foam.4) Pan-Fried Foie Gras (supplement $12): a stellar mainstay in their rotating stable of appetizers. The melty richness of the liver was balanced with a whipped light-as-air banana mash, Jamaican rum and Madagascar vanilla.5) Onto the mains, the Chicken Leg Confit: set atop a velvety garlic potato mash, slathered in a luscious red wine sauce, and contrasted with the subtle bitterness of charred radicchio.6) Braised Compressed Oxtail: fork-tender, and laden with ratatouille and blanketed in a caramelized onion puree and robust red wine sauce.7) For a lighter entree, the flaky Grilled Perch, stewed with boiled potato and fennel in a tomato fish broth, was flavourful and exquisite. This was served in an earthernware and then ladled onto a bowl for consumption.8) For dessert, there was just the one option of a sublime Valrhona Hot Chocolate Soup with black pepper-spiked vanilla ice-cream and sesame crisp. Great textures and wonderfully balanced"

First there's the reintroduction of the weekend lunches at Joel Robuchon restaurants. Then this weekend, Celebrity Chef Andrew Turner of Hotel Café Royal in London is presenting his specially created dishes (13 to 16 May) alongside resident Chef Scott Webster.We started our set dinner with some Stone Hearth Flat Bread served with extra virgin olive oil, butter and dip. Truffled Kalamata Olive and Macadamia Pesto are the hot favorites here and i enjoyed the fluffy hot bread when it was first served. Osia's Char Grilled Fremantle Octopus with cucumber apple slaw and green chili jam failed to impress with its rubbery texture.  Osia won me back with their Pan fried Foie Gras by with textures of banana (in espuma and caramelized form), Madagascar vanilla and Jamaican rum. It's a first having bananas paired with foie gras and it was surprisingly a good match due to the savory and salty caramelized bananas. The signature Osia dish is the Perch with sesame ratte potato, pea tendril, soy milk curd and a shiromiso glaze. Light tasting dish with a little sweetness from the miso."

The expectations are met for a good restaurant, but does not have the makings of an excellent one, we did not walk away wow-ed by the food. Our experience was marred by the inability of the wait staff to execute their duties with pride. They were malaise, and at time downright condescending and rude in their communication with us. Unfortunately, this was the case for 3 of the 4 wait staff we encountered. Despite an empty restaurant (only 3 other tables were occupied) and four wait staff loitering the area, the front of house was at a total loss. No one filled our water. We mentioned that we wanted wine with our mains, but no one followed up or offered the wine menu. When we were seated, one wait staff said ""We can offer you our flatbread, please choose two toppings"". We were later charged for the flatbread, and duly paid. However, this left a poor impression as we did not feel that the wait staff was unaware of the implications of the words she chose.We spent approx $350 for the dinner. For this price, there are numerous other places one have visited for a memorable dinner with better food quality and service. We will not return, and recommend that if you choose to patronise this establishment, try it for a casual night instead of a special occasion."

As a result, he has become somewhat spoiled in the gastronomical department, with very jaded taste buds. So when he rang me up one day and gushed about a new restaurant, I sat up and took notice. In fact, he even went so far as to proclaim it the to-go place to take someone he'd want to impress.When faced with such a bold statement., I quickly grabbed the nearest friend and went down to Osia as soon as our schedules allowed.Food : The truffled  kalamanta olive flatbreads were pretty yummy and came with a tube of squeezable dip which was really fun! I loved loved loved the seafood ice experience. Maybe I'm partial to seafood, and maybe also because I'm partial to sorbet, but this was such a great combination. I always believed that if one served the best produce, one needs to do very little to actually enhance its flavour. And nowhere was this clearer than in this particular dish, where the natural sea freshness of the food was sharpened and crystallised by the different accompanying flavours of sorbet. The foie gras was pretty well done, as was the compression of truffled water melon with goat cheese. The beef was decent but the barramundi was so-so. Didn't think much of the chocolate Valrhona soup but then I'm not much of a chocolate fan.Ambience : Lovely, we were there on a Wednesday and it struck a nice balance between bustling and a ghost town.Service : Excellent.Overall a great experience.

One of the few Indonesian restaurants in Singapore to serve the famous Tahu Telor which is basically a deepfried tower of eggs and tofu topped with a sweet-spicy dark sauce. The texture is one that is both crispy and soft. Another crowd favorite at Tambuah Mas would be their signature Chendol with fresh green bean jelly and palm sugar, the perfect way to end your Indonesian meal experience!"
Swee Kee Wanton Noodles,"Blk 6, Jalan Bukit Merah #01-39, ABC Brickworks Food Centre Singapore 153028 Singapore ",153028,1.28703560089104,103.809955080725,[],Singapore G.,kh_vlcg_MLYzGO64xSiOxQ,"Singapore, Singapore",5,4/18/2018,"When I arrived at this popular stall on a weekday at 8.15am for the first time today, there was already a queue 6 deep! Deliciously firm noodles with lean char siu. I'm partial to HK style wontons, which is quite different from local wontons, so I would have given this 4.5 stars. However, the friendliness of the proprietress, her husband and sister really lights up the place and deserves an extra star. Hokkien, Cantonese or Mandarin spoken here."
Tuckshop,1 Maritime Square #03-19/20 Harbourfront Centre Singapore 099253 Singapore ,099253,1.26447844519217,103.820315193363,[],Roland S.,EB3xsU98loQHCm6Ub1bJIA,"Singapore, Singapore",4,9/11/2015,"Located in HarborFront on level 3, this place is good to catch up on some local delights as well as Thai food. Plus point - it's in an air-conditioned mall. The stall ranges from Vegetable Rice, Ban Mian, Roast Meat, Nasi Padang and Thai. I generally come here for the roast meat selection as well as the Ban Mian stall as they carry a Gan Lao Mian which I pretty much like. I will probably take a picture and write a little more about it the next time I am there. Maybe the only little dislike is that the seating is a little tighter and being my size, I naturally felt a bit too squeezy. Hmmmm.... Time to lose weight... But does that mean I need to stop coming here for my foodie??!!"
