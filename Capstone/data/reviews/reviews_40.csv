Not many people knew this place, just yet. However, the crowd for a Tuesday evening is not bad at all. We arrived at 7pm and there were already a few tables occupied. I must say that I quite like the place because it feels like Ubud, in Bali sans the paddy field. You can see the crane tower from Interlace! We ordered our favourite Duck Pizza & chicken wings that came with wine (Happy Hour).A new dish to us was seafood aglio olio ($18). It is not bad, but for the price we paid, I will go for another round of duck pizza ($20). Thank you.Another plus point is Shili & Adi perform on Tuesday night. Thus, we were there. Great company for the night. Yes, I will go back again."

We arrived on bikes and were made to feel very unwelcome, with lots of surly glares and demands that we leave our (expensive) bikes outside when they have a huge lawn with plenty of space inside. They cited the safety of children... yet they have huge blower fans presumably with spinning blades inside. Not a stop on your next cycling adventure. In the end we put our bikes where they asked - which obstructed entry for everyone else. Idiotic."

It was absolutely pathetic and this is me trying my best to be diplomatic. Duck slices were few in number, tough, badly seasoned and extemely gag-inducing. Hoisin sauce tasted more like teriyaki with too much sugar mixed in. Crust was soft and completely soggy in all areas apart from the sides. The most hilarious part of this experience happened after we left. Requested to doggy bag the remains of our pizza (which was simply too unappetizing to finish) and they came back with something resembling a foil ball. Okay. Upon opening it at home, we found the remaining slices squished into a dough ball whose center contained the soggy flaps of what once was ""crispy"" popiah skin. Only redeeming feature would be the bouncy castles. Go if you have hyperactive children and like talking to waiters that hate their lives."

Sprinkle it on anything and it is delicious. Well I fully agree! In fact, shortly after a trip to the nearby Two Chefs' Eating Place, I was introduced to another place near Anchorpoint at Stirling Road with.. Cereal Chicken. I actually don't really eat cereal prawns normally because the prawns are fried and you have to eat it with the shell, which I don't like. So cereal chicken is INGENIOUS!That also makes me, according to my boss, a serial cereal eater. Hur.It was really really good. Barring the fact that we were starving by the time we were there at 9pm after work, the dish stands by its own merits of being so delicious, I kept thinking about it the next day!The chicken is fried and the cereal thrown in to add that sweet savoury taste. It is not too oily - in fact it felt quite light. The chicken was juicy and the cereal complimented the crunchiness of the skin. I could go on and on about how awesome this is. Just go. Try it for yourself!We also ordered 4 other dishes that night. Surprisingly, ALL of them were very very good. I am not kidding. This place does good tze char. The fish (top left) was very fresh and smooth. The hotplate tofu was flavourful and had a lot of ingredients. The egg with ""chai po"" (some salted vegetable bits) was also full of unami. Lastly the sweet and sour pork was juicy yet not too sour/strong in the sauce which was done just nice.If you are looking for an all-rounded tze char place to go for a family dinner or gathering, try Stirling Seafood. I hope you liked it as much as I do because it is a great place! I am definitely going back to try their other dishes and reorder the Cereal Chicken."

Everything I've tried so far is good. Basil chicken and basil pork are spicy and tasty though they do not have a strong wok hei smell like some other places. Stuffed chicken wing comes hot and is crispy.Olive rice is good here. Likewise for their veggie dishes, simply stir fried with garlic or belachan. The papaya salad is also spicy and refreshing.Tom yum seafood soup (3 versions - clear, original orange and coconut) is tangy and spicy. I have tried both original orange and with coconut and they are equally good. The coconut version will have a bit of creamy taste to it.The green curry chicken is fantastic over plain rice. I have run out of words to describe what I had but so far nothing is awful. For drinks, I prefer the iced thai milk tea over the iced lemongrass. You could ask to doggy bag the leftovers even when the portion is really tiny. It is that good not to be thrown away. The service was efficient and the auntie serving us had typical auntie behavior - making sure our table was ok. It looked like it was going to rain and we were seated outside with no awning over us. She kept asking if we were ok and in the end told us it might be better to move the table in. So she moved it to the walkway outside another shop which was closed for the day. This is definitely not a fine dining place and is a laid back casual eatery with a homely feel to it. You come here for good Thai food in an unpretentious place."

I was expecting it to be very good but I thought the dish I had was just okay in terms of flavor. I also felt like it wasn't as good value as some of the other random shops I've been to.I got the chicken red curry (small) and it was like $7.50 or so. Still cheap by USD standards but I feel like other places would offer the same amount at like half the price or so? I thought the flavor was okay. They had some chicken pieces and some potatoes. Not much meat in a small portion though. I had to pay $1 SGD for okay rice.Also they didn't give me any napkins or water but I think that's pretty typical of most Singaporean eateries.

This thought had recently grew stronger when I saw our local Television Programme advertising its cuisine.One of the recommended dishes, Thai Fish Cake. Most of their ""finger food"" items were charged based on per piece which was quite different from other thai restaurants. Fish cake was abit oily, however the fish meat was rather fresh and one can feel the bounciness as we sank our teeth in. The salad and sweet sour chilli had complimented the dish well. Luminous yellow pineapple rice with rasins, cashew nuts, pork floss and prawns sum up the plate of  pineapple rice. Taste wise, I felt that it's pretty average, nothing to rave about.The stuff chicken wing was the main highlight among all dishes. Do not worry about eating them with your bare hands and removing the bones. In fact, only the bottom part of the chicken has bone, the rest was stuffed with  goodies.Let's check out their secret recipe in their stuffed chicken wings.The exterior of the wing was fried to crisp golden brown perfection with fillings made up of minced chicken meat mixed together with bits of chestnuts and sweet corn kernels. Uniquely Joe's Kitchen!After the stuff chicken, this is another specialty of Joe's Kitchen that one cannot left the place without. Given a choice of crispy tofu, hotplate and claypot toufu, the server highly recommended the first option. Well, we bought her words and it was great. Just like the stuffed chicken wings, the toufu was specially made, blended with seafood bits and fried over the hot oil. The exterior was very crispy, not too oily and to my liking.How can a Thai Cuisine be without their so called Fresh Thai Coconut and Lemon Grass drink? Ha! These were the beverages for the night.Minced Pork Omelette was nothing special, quite a standard dish.Prawns with cashew nuts was tad spicy as it was cooked with dried chilli and capsicums. Although the portion was medium, the number of prawns given wasn't that much.After the night's dinner, I find that what most interest me was their appetizer or finger food items. They were special and not many Thai Cuisine offers such items on their menu."

Over a year or two, one friend or the other would mention Joe's Thai and I would resolve to try it. Now regret it took so long to make there! The next visit will be soon! All in all, an experience that puts my older favorite basic Thai restaurants to shame. Among the local - easy parking, easy access from the street, and easy setting - Thai places, I would say I haven't seen better. Until now I would succumb to the continuing lure of E-Sarn from its Sixth Avenue days, even as its food and service continue to sink successively lower across its locations. Finally, no more inertia-driven journeys there. It will be Joe's Thai. The service is warm, friendly, and efficient. There is shared laughter among the wait staff, and an of late rare eagerness to please. I reserved a place for 3. For a very inexpensive restaurant, I was utterly surprised to find the spot properly reserved, with 3 places neatly set with plate, utensils, side bowl and spoon and chopsticks when we arrived! A second server came by to double check that we were the right party!!The portions were generous, and we ordered several small size dishes. And the prices are very reasonable, with small portions ranging from $7-11. The Tom Yum soup with prawn was the most delicious I have had in some time. There is something special to it, but I couldn't tell - and nor would the server who told me, ""it is our chef's secret"". The red curry was equally outstanding. So were the sweet potato leaf, pineapple rice and fish cake. The excellent basil minced chicken had a slightly darker, thicker sauce than one usual finds at other Thai places, laced with something sour to add to the soy sauce-based preparation. Finally the red ruby dessert and the tapioca were delicious too. If I had to quibble, I'd say the green curry could be spicier, and less thick - no complaints though, this loser dish among the order was very good too! And the red ruby could be slightly (very slightly) less milky. In short, you can't go wrong. Oh, well, yes, you can by gorging excessively! So rush down when you can to tickle your palate. Don't miss the Tom Yum. And skip a meal prior!"

There's never much glamour in taking away stuff from anywhere, least of all a place that looks as simple as Joe's Kitchen. But especially in the food business you can never judge a book by its cover, just as how you should never judge a dinner by the tablecloth.This was indeed very delicious Thai takeaway, quick, fuss free, and inexpensive. The Tom Yum Soup (the clear red sort), when served warm, will most definitely give you a run for your money, if not at least a run for some water. It's packed with spiciness in a very delectable way, such that even me with my low tolerance couldn't resist taking so many spoonfuls of this bad boy. The basil chicken was very fragrant with a very strong taste without being too overwhelming. I like the fact that it's minced, rather than in chunks, as this allows the meat to get coated with sauce. The stuffed chicken was a very interesting dish as well, even if the bits of corn in it turned me off a little, but the size of it was rather generous indeed, and I was happy enough with the one wing I had. We had the fish cake as well, which was a tad pricey, given that it was just rather average. Go for the green curry as well though - it had a good ratio of milk and spice, and the meat in it was very tender and I could just imagine having this accompanied with plain rice.That said, my favourite dish of all was the pineapple rice, which was very tasty, had the right level of sweet, and the right proportion of ingredients. So often they get it wrong with having either too huge chunks of pineapple, or not enough pineapple, or no raisins, or being too oily - but this has it spot on. Definite recommendation in my books."

Think I should stick to Indian / Peranakan / Malay /Chinese spicy food and skip Thai spicy and sour stuff. Prawn claypot vermicelli was OK, just annoyed had to keep picking out the bits of garlic.Service: Awful beyond awful. Grumpy old waitress ambled her way up to us and kept banging on about whether we could finish the food. So we asked her if there was a smaller helping. She said no and kept pushing the pad thai but said it was the same size as vermicelli (???). We insisted on trying the vermicelli and she kept pushing the pad thai.

The kitchen is helmed by Joe, who used to work at a Thai restaurant before starting his own little piece of heaven in Alexandra. Sure the restaurant looks like a coffee shop with air con, but damn the food tastes so good. My dining partner and I eat there at least once a fortnight and our favourite dish hand's down is the Honey Chicken. Its a plate of chicken strips fried really crispy with garlic slices then covered in a thick honey/buttery sauce that I can't quite decipher. It's very addictive and I haven't found this dish at any other Thai restaurant and will absolutely die if anything happens to Joe. His tom yam soup is also wonderfully piquant with a balance of coconut, chilli and spices and I like the seafood version best. The clay pot crab or prawn vermicelli here is also a knockout as Joe uses lard, so if you're concerned about your health eat rice or something. I also love the prawn cakes, which are made with fresh shrimp and very little filler. The dishes I don't really fancy are the sambal sweet potato leaves (too dry), pad thai (for some reason very flat compared to the Thai vermicelli of the same price) and red wine prawns (sauce is weird). To put it short, Joe's is the type of place you close your eyes and ignore all the non-food related factors and just eat to satiate your Thai cravings. Prices here are also incredibly competitive so I go frequently enough to make sure they don't go out of business ever (not that they need my business)!"

Uh-huh. Five stars. And I don't award these lightly. Apart from the simply phenomenal food, what made this such a fantastic experience was the friendly & humorous owners (husband & wife team) with a kind twinkle in their eyes. Sum Kee is a tze char restaurant tucked away in a nondescript building in Telok Blangah. Even our cab driver wasn't 100% sure of the location. But step into their quaint compound and you will be hit by its old skool charm. An old swing sits in their garden, & the interior is kitschy with orange walls. A sign says (paraphrased) ""we cook our food fresh. So please wait and eat"". You can tell they are quite fun here!On to the food. I'm gonna list the dishes I enjoyed. 1. Ultraman Chicken (咸蛋鸡). This is a salted egg chicken and OMG I die. It is so damn good. It is named after Ultraman because this beloved manga character's Chinese name is literally translated as Salted Egg Superman (咸蛋超人). The witty lady boss really has a wicked sense of wordplay and it bloody works because it is so memorable!!!!2. Beancurd in Pumpkin Gravy. Now, this is not a typical tze char dish in Singapore and you've gotta try it. I love pumpkin soup so this appealed to me greatly. Throw in the fragrant minced pork and hello!!! Winner!!!!3. Salted egg crab, Black Pepper Crab and Chilli Crab. Now, I liked all three. The black pepper crab is actually a little on the sweeter side, which surprisingly still works. My fave is the chili crab -- the gravy is not too sweet and actually is kinda zesty!!! (I usually worry about Chilli crab being too sweet). So I enjoyed the kick. Oooh lala!4. curry Fish head. Now, this curry is not too thick and not like the typical northern indian curry. It is like a Chinese curry - more ""lemak"" (coconutty). The Red Snapper was very tender and fresh and boy, was it delish!!!! Photo attached!!! Now, if only there is a Scratch & Sniff function in the photo so you can smell its fragrance!!!!5. Cuttlefish with Kang Kong. Their version is very tasty indeed. Oh boy. They throw in generous amounts of crushed peanuts and sesame on top, and it becomes crunchy and yummy and everything just becomes a party in your mouth. 6. Ngor Hiang. They add water chestnut into it and suddenly, it becomes a crunchy delight, and completely elevates this humble dish. 7. Fried Ice Cream. Hands up if you can find fried ice-cream these days. Where. WHERE?!?!? This is old school style which I love. Fried on the outside and lovely cold vanilla ice-cream on the inside. What a splendid way to end a meal. Loves. There are many more dishes I enjoyed (like their Wallet Chicken) but writing a long review on a mobile phone is tough work (and my poor eyes!!!!). So please go to Sum Kee and do try as many dishes as your belly permits. Honestly -- NO REGRETS. Calories gained are absolutely WORTH IT. Reservations are simply a must on weekends. And oh yah, if you need toilet paper, just ask them for it. My tip to you. NOW GO TO SUM KEE!!!!!"

And BurgerLabo emerged as the clear winner out of the 12 restaurants that were put to the test, which were Hans Im Glück, Omakase Burger, Shake Shack, Wolf Burger, McDonald's, Carl's Junior, Fat Burger, Black Tap at MBS, Burger Joint in Amoy Street, Burger+, and Fat Papas in Bali Lane. Needless to say, I was soooo tempted and intrigued to try it after reading that article. LolSo here I came today, to try the best burgers out of all the famous burgers in Singapore. A little disclaimer though, I'm not those that try every single burger that open up in town. I'm not that into burgers, since I'm health conscious... lol. I know I know, health conscious yet still greedy and all about food, how contradictary. But seriously, what got me intrigued here though, is that BurgerLabo uses a 170g beef patty for their Basic Burger ($23), that is made from a blend of grass-fed Black Angus beef neck, Aomori Gyu ribeye, Toriyama Umami Wagyu A4 tenderloin, and Sendai Wagyu A5 brisket, to get that 'perfect' balance of flavors. The patty is further topped with grilled organic tomato, locally-farmed Green Wave lettuce, 2 slices of American cheese, house-made bone marrow 'butter' and sauce. The bone-marrow butter is used to toast the bread and grill the meat patty. On the special sauce, Mr Tan Ken Loon, owner of the 3 month old BurgerLabo, said: ""I love to eat bone-marrow and I wanted to incorporate it into the burger patty. However, the oils will come out and the patty will start to shrink. So instead, I extracted the bone marrow, warmed it into a liquid state and, after it is chilled, it looks like a milky white blob of butter. We don't use oil, we use this.""This is the 12th version of Mr Tan's Basic Burger, from when he started on his burger journey in December 2015. BurgerLabo is the sister restaurant to The Naked Finn, which is also owned by Mr Tan. To this much precision and care taken to engineer a perfect beef patty, with the meticulous effort of using organic ingredients and grass-fed beef for the patty to appeal to the ever growing health conscious crowd like me, I'm totally sold and determined to come here to try the burger. So after the long ass background story, so yeah, the burger was AWESOMELY delicious!!! I cannot describe it all in words really, how delicious and melt in your mouth the whole burger was, you really have to just go try it for the experience. Perfectly well balanced and juicy, the patty's charred surface gave it a smoky flavor, without the patty being overcooked, due to it being cooked a la plancha. Cooking the meat on a plancha sears the meat better than any other cooking surface can. It creates a browned, slightly crispy exterior while sealing in all the juices. For those Ramly burger lovers, you can add a fried organic free-range egg with a runny orange yolk to the burger, for an extra $3. The Basic Burger with a single 170g patty is $23, a double patty of 150g each (if I'm not wrong) will costs you $36. Adding an egg to the double patty, the burger will set you back a whopping $39. I was expecting throngs of people rushing to go try this burger out after the article got published in our national papers, but surprisingly I could easily get a table without making a reservation. I guess the location is a little inaccessible if you don't drive and probably not everyone is willing to part with $39 for a burger, since a burger is afterall just a burger. Albeit it was a very well made one. If cost is a factor, just go for the Basic Burger, that is already a very delicious burger imo. But if you have decided to travel all the way JUST for this burger, and you don't live in Singapore, I'll say, go for the double patty with an egg thrown in to get the full experience of that goodness. Hahaa... I've ordered the mid-joint wings, it was good too, nicely marinated but it was kinda tiny and not worth the $12 for that 5 tiny pieces. I have eaten chunkier and juicier wings, price-performance ratio isn't good. I'll suggest you save your money and skip that. Service was fast and friendly. Not a good place for conversation though. So, was the burger worth it? Yes, I would think it was well worth bursting my calories today for it. I will definitely bring my foreign friends visiting Singapore who are craving burgers, to try this place out. So 5 stars for the burger, until I chanced upon another burger that impress me more than this one did. Hope my review will help you in some way to decide if to dump $40 for a burger. Hahaha... I've tried. :)"

As for the meal, it was just amazing. I could taste the umami in the A4/A5 wagyu patty with each bite, and the truffle fries were outstanding with a strong truffle flavor.

They tasted like it would cater to Western (or in my case American specifically) tastes, curiously enough.-black pepper beef: beef was very tender / chewy and sauce was strong. I think I would have liked this dish a tad bit crispier but there might be other beef dishes with different cooking styles-sweet and sour bean dough: fried bean dough yum! Sauce was sweet and a little tangy. Felt super unhealthy though but eat sparingly!-sautéed spinach with garlic: classic can't really go wrong with this if you wanted a leafy salty dish-cold cucumbers in spicy sauce: I usually don't like raw cucumbers but I really liked the spicy sauces.

Great flavor, right spiciness, right thickness. Potato is soft, rice is not clumpy and nicely cooked. The only downside is that the chicken is slightly overcooked. Curry is simply a unique dish that doesn't really rely on the ingredients as much as the sauce. So despite the slightly overcooked curry chicken, it's still the best curry chicken in Singapore.Prices start from $3 including rice or bread. The dollar amount you order would indicate the amount of chicken drumlets or wings given to you. $3 = 3 and $4 = 4 so on. Well, how good is it? Let's just say that it's so good I would even drink the spicy curry on it's own. The queue is perpetually long and you'd have to wait for a while to get seats. Service on the other hand is extremely fast. Within 5 minutes, all your orders would arrive. It simply is the best chicken curry in Singapore!"

The serving is very generous, and even with two pieces of bread( or more, or rice, depending on one's choice), it is quite impossible to finish the huge bowl of curry. The only drawback is that the place is so cramped and busy during meal times, it could be easier to eavesdrop on the loud customers next to you than hear what your companion might be saying.

It felt like we were dining in a private kitchen and as I understand, this stems from Chef Mok's experience in private dining.I really liked the plating, which was elegantly, modern and not too fussy. Simple and clean, with bright, vibrant colours which made the food pop and the ingredients shine.The sea scallop in the appetizer trio was perfectly cooked with a nice sear and I enjoyed the roasted pork belly too. Not too sure about the pickled mushrooms as a complement although I suppose this was meant to whet one's appetite. The iberico ham and foie gras were delicious too and I loved the pan seared ""crust"" of the foie gras which was crispy, and lovely against the soft liver. The fillet of hake was a simple and clean dish, which I typically favour for lunch. Would have appreciated more greens though (and perhaps smaller greens, as the salad leaves were a bit big and hard to eat). My dining partner had the oven roasted chicken leg. We were impressed with the crispy skin and the soft, fall-off-the-bone meat on the chicken. The skin was light and crispy and had a nice seasoning to it. I actually really liked the bed of chopped carrots that the chicken was on. They looked deceptively like simple boiled carrots but were so tasty! All in all, lunch was very pleasant and we could see the effort that Chef Mok put into each dish. Service was friendly, in a homely way. That was nice but a little out of sync with the style and feel of the restaurant. We were served some home made bread which to be honest, tasted just that, and not in a good way. Location is a bit odd and not as trendy as some of the new and hip restaurants that have opened up recently in Singapore. All in all, while the food is good I think that the restaurant may need just a little bit more ""oomph"" to bring in the crowds. For now, I think people like exciting and new dishes and for the entire experience to be about more than just the food. The dishes here, while good, and the ingredients definitely shine, are a bit lacking in imagination and I just wished that the dining experience here was a bit more exciting."

Called up my parents who immediately agreed to join. We were later debating how long it has been since we've been here. Certainly not since I've been married, as the wife and kids have never been here. We figured at least 30 years ago as we stopped coming here after we moved out from Pasir Panjang. But after all this time, this place did not disappoint, the food was as good as we remembered it. The sar pwor ngau lum (claypot beef brisket) was warming and tender at the same time. The j-hee pao kai  (paper wrapped chicken) was to die for. My 'ang mor kwan' kids ate up very every thing with no complaints. We had to order extra rice.

Wasn't expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised when I lofted the lid to reveal a generous amount of Uni on top of my egg. Rich, sweet and tasting like the sea, the robust flavour of the Uni matched the smooth, sweet egg perfectly. Gindara Mentai Bento ($22)Like any bento, you get the wonderfully little side dishes like salad, tofu, crispy fish skin but the star was definitely the Gindara. Not one but two generously thick pieces of Gindara, perfectly grilled. They were had the perfect amount of fat, making the fish soft, succulent and flaked apart easily while the mentaiko.... wow. The mentaiko was probably one of the best mentaikos we've ever had and it really help add the saltiness to the fish yet, at the same time, bringing out the sweetness of the Gindara. A very perfectly cooked dish. Chirashi Don ($18)My go to dish at any Japanese establishment.The chirashi came with Tamago yaki (1), Salmon (3), Salmon Belly (1), Maguro (2), Octopus (2), Hamachi (1), Mekajiki (1), Ebiko and Ikura. Sashimi slices were nice and thick and were very fresh. Not a hint of fishiness in any of the fish. The salmon belly was amazing, nearly melting in your mouth with each bite. I did feel that the rice had a tad bit too much vinegar and I'm not the biggest fan of that sweet, pink, powdery Sakura thing but overall it was still a very very good bowl of chirashi. We have to come back for their dinner as they seem to have triple the number of items as compared to lunch. So if you're looking to avoid a pretentiously expensive Japanese restaurant or steering away from those cheap knock-offs represented by a green frog than this place is a MUST visit!"

The pizza is made to order and comes in 2 main forms: New York (thin) style, and deep dish. Since deep dish seemed like their signature, my boyfriend and I split the Jonh's 4 way. The edges were crispy from all the cheese fried in the pan, and the dough was thick but fluffy, retaining a good chewy texture. Only wish was there there were more of the sauce and toppings! Just because the crust was so thick, it felt like it could use a little more sauce on top."

The second incarnation at Dempsey was the peak. Everything at this new location, next door to the last one, is in every way a step down,except for the price!! The place is more cramped and more downmarket. The food is haphazard. Some dishes remain excellent, others not so. For instance, the lamb chops, while flavourful, are quite tough. Service staff are friendly, but a bit blurred and overzealous, keen to clear up the plates although we haven't finished the expensive dishes. At S$140 per pax at lunch, we thought it was poor value. For Mediterranean food, Pistachio at Wheelock Place is better AND better value. For us, Blu has moved from green light to red"

This time we started with a wonderful bottle of Santorini white and wanted another wine to go with our final salad (light dinner night). The bottle we were recommended was absolutely delicious, but just not a good fit with our meal. We politely spoke to the manager about this and he was incredibly accommodating about recommending the perfect glass of white wine that was a superb pairing.

I asked for medium well lamb, it was well done.  My friend asked for well done meat, his was well done.   Personally I've had much much much better Greek food, at much more reasonable prices.  They did bring out a dessert with a candle, which was delicious.  Nice enough service, but I think I can find better."

It's a bit out of the way and a pain to get to if you don't drive, but drivers (and me) love this spot because you never have to worry about paying an arm and a leg just for your car.Sometimes parking is rather tight in the main lots, but if you don't mind walking a little, there is usually a parking spot in some of the less crowded clusters. The main Dempsey Road can also get a tad crowded so here's a hint: Minden Road leads you to the area just fine and is usually less used...There's also a great selection of dining places so if it gets crowded, it's easy to just walk to the next spot.

The feel of the area itself brings you back a few decades, with only a small market and a few shops serving this quiet community. First impression? Old Habit brings back even more nostalgia with their old outdoor seating area. Made up of vintage clam shell chairs, you would have expected a couple of old uncles in singlets to be asleep on the chairs, if not for the bright lights of the cafe.Opening the door, we were expecting to be hit by a wave of muskiness from the old items on display but was pleasantly surprised when the place smelt pretty.... Good! If you're looking for a fun antique items to buy than this is the place for you! Old telephones, photos, textbooks, comics, you name it, they have it. It's like being a 5 year old again. With their extensive collection of view finders / view masters, it was hours of  fun going through everything they had to offer and the best part? Almost everything's for sale!Now to the food. A simple menu made up of around 5-6 items per category (Appetizers, mains etc), ""Old Habit"" chooses to keep it simple and manageable, ensuring that by not over stretching themselves with an overly extensive menu, they will not sacrifice the quality of the food being served.Drinks: Lemon Lime Float & CoCo Melaka What better way to add to the nostalgia of the cafe than with a drink that reminds us of the past. Well thought through and re-created, the Lemon Lime Float tastes exactly like Solero, a lime and vanilla ice cream that I'm sure many of us LOVED while we were younger. A perfect drink for a really really hot day! The CoCo Melaka Soda was a nice twist. Coconut juice, with a hint of Gula Melaka topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The Gula Melaka adds a nice richness n sweetness to an otherwise ordinary drink and even helps in bringing out the sweetness and fragrance of the coconut juice. Spaghetti Carbonara. Will I ever learn my lesson? Ordering Carbonaras even though I see the words ""creamy"". I'm proud to finally say that, this carbonara is pretty darn good! Unlike most Carbonaras, we could actually taste the eggs in the sauce. The sauce was rich, eggy and so delicious! Pasta was al Dante and that sprinkle of chilli powder gave it an extra kick. Only thing is lacked was a good sprinkle of parmesan to give is that sharpness but overall, definitely one the nicest we've had under $15.00.Jessy's Spicy CasseroleNow this was an interesting twist! Unlike the normal Shepard's Pie, this was done with a chicken chunks marinated in a Nonya sauce. The initial scoop felt a little disappointing, with the lack of gravy and meat, but as we slowly dug in, revealing the juicy pieces of chicken, we soon realised that a gravy wasn't really needed! The nonya sauce or marinade used was so tasty! And the mashed used had a hint of curry powder which added to the fragrance of the dish, elevating the potatoes to a whole different level of yumness.This was a very well constructed dish that turned an otherwise ordinary shepherd's pie into something a little more local. Coconut kueh with Vanilla Ice cream. What a way to end our meal with this delicious dessert! With crunchy coconut flakes prominent in the kueh, this felt like an Asian take on a bread and butter pudding. The fragrant smell of toasted coconut flakes mixed with the sweetness from the ice cream and the slight saltiness from kueh makes this an absolute delight to have. Overall, this place is fantastic, with the owners taking the time to slowly show you some of the cool toys they have available. They're friendly and very welcoming and you can tell that they have the dedication and passion to keep this place going, ensuring that whether you're 6 or 60, you'll feel like a kid again once you step through the doors of Old Habits."

Excellent service and food by the husband and wife team. Food is reasonably priced and value for money. Also, the cafe is a museum hence there is lots to explore and it is a walk down memory lane."
