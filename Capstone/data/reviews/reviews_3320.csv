It started with the preserved duck egg which I would actually recommend (just don't ask for a full description until after you eat it!). For the entree we had chicken rice which was awesome. I definitely recommend this for a local meal. We also had the green dragon vegetables (delicious!) and a tofu soup that was awesome. The overall restaurant was very nice and clean and clearly it's a place that locals frequent. I would definitely recommend for a sit down meal and good local flavors.

Boon Tong Kee is often regarded as one of local favorite spots where families and friends gather for good times over delicious Cantonese home-style food. Many regulars come to Boon Tong Kee primarily for their Signature Boiled Chicken or Famous Chicken Rice, also known for its silky white sauce chicken rice. Although chicken is the signature dish here, there is a wide selection of irresistible creations you wouldn't want to miss out. Some of the notable mentions such as Fried Bean Sprouts with Salted Fish, Fried Assorted Vegetables (Kang Kong) with Sambal, Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Eggs and Crispy Deep Fried Chicken are quite popular. The options are simply too many to list... if you have the appetite and the belly, I'd say explore and try as much as you can indulge."

Went thru the menu but It took a full 8 mins before our order was taken. The restaurant was not that full. A couple who came after us was served before us. My wife wanted to walk out, but as good people, we waited. Finally the chicken dish arrived and we tucked in to succulent meal.

The other stuff they try to push on you is passable but just stick with the chicken rice and all will be well. Came here on the second day of CNY and the line was insane with over an hour wait. We had heard the claypot rice here was quite popular and thus we ordered ahead while waiting for our table so the timing synced up. Alas, the claypot rice is alright but very forgettable. But the dependable staples didn't disappoint. Love the fragrant savory rice here. I can eat bowls of it! Paired with the silken white skin and moist chicken, it just works. Another staple, that fried tofu. Impeccable delicate and soft on the inside with a light crispy exterior. I don't know how it holds its texture but when dipped in the salad dressing, so yummy! Oh and that char siew that's already on your table when you're seated... it's just sublime. Being CNY, we also ordered lo hei for some festive cheer and our server was really personable in preparing it. But for everyday classics that won't disappoint, the chicken rice, fried tofu, and char siew are winners for sure. Also this location is open late which is a plus for supper cravings."

The restaurant is clean and the staff have the usual stiff upper lip until you warm them up with some ""xie xie's"" and attempting to banter with them. We of course ordered a plate of HC which come with individual bowls of rice (hells yeh). The chicken never fails, especially when you top it off with ginger, sweet soy and chilli. We also ordered a range of dishes from fried tofu (hells yes), baby spinach with salted and century egg, a Cantonese fave, broccoli and mushrooms, ""gourmet"" fried spring rolls and the seafood horfun. Special shout outs to the tofu which was light with the perfect amount of salty coating and the horfun. Sweet baby J, the horfun was to die for. The sheets themselves were the fattest I've seen. The seafood fresh. The sauce, solid. I was so full but kept going back for more. Downside: A LOT of MSG. MSG is killing my food vibe in Singapore.

Flaky , moist and just seasoned right. The sauce didnt overpower and just the right amount. It was delish.

After declining, I asked for iced water and instead got some weird coconut drink. If you can't even understand the word ""water"" that's definitely a problem. She did manage to get the rest of our order correct, probably because I pointed on the menu.Despite this, my dad truly enjoyed it, and our bill was under $20.

Unfortunately, it's a little far for me to constantly visit them but they are still one of my favorite chicken rice restaurants to visit when I have the craving. With all the chicken rice stalls and restaurants popping up, with one receiving a Bib Gourmand from Singapore's Michelin guide, what differentiates Loy Kee from the rest of the pack?Why it is still my Go To place for chicken rice. Firstly, the rice. Unlike most places that tend to offer healthier options these days, Loy Kee doesn't. Is it sinful? YES! But it's also bursting with flavour and nothing makes me happier than having oily lips with every mouthful of rice (best time to kiss a loved one). The Chicken. What's popular now is boneless chicken rice, where they skillfully remove all the bones, either from the breast or thighs and serve it beautifully presented on a plate. I, on the other hand, love picking meat of the bones as that's where all the flavours are. Despite being a huge boiled chicken fan, I really love the roasted chicken here. The skin is nice and tasty yet the meat remains juicy and tender. We also get more consistency with the roasted chicken as we tend to realize that the boiled chicken is a bit of a hit and miss, with it sometimes being juicy and tender and other times overcooked and dry. The SoupsAnother trademark of Loy Kee is their soups, with watercress soup being the most popular. The soups are not MSG ladened and my favourite has to be their watercress soup. Served as an individual double boiled bowl or in a traditional soup pot if you order for 2 or more (those old traditional ones our grandmother's used to cook over charcoal), the umami-ness of the pork and the sweetness of the watercress are infused wonderfully into a delightful soup, making it the perfect companion to the chicken rice. The Condiments A chicken rice is only as good as the condiments it comes with and nothing is more important than the holy trinity, Chicken Rice Chilli, Minced ginger and Dark Soy Sauce.While I find the chilli and dark soy sauce here pretty average, the ginger is very nice and adds an even deeper dimension when eaten with the rice. Overview. Again, it's up to personal preference but we really love the rice here and the chicken is good too. Paired along with a soup and the condiment and it makes for one of the best chicken rice in Singapore."

Was it? They need to rename the restaurant.Chicken was nice (definitely not ""the best"") but the portions were too small.  Rice was nice and shiny but lacking any moisture, like it's been sitting around for awhile. The accompanying soup was a notch better than most chicken rice joints. It contained bits of green onions, tomato, and tofu. Unlike some places where it just seems to be a bowl of water from boiling the chicken. Like the option of indoor or outdoor seating. Nice clean shop. Old school decor. Solid seats and tables. The weirdest part about the whole dining experience at Loy Kee was the wait service. We sat down, the waitress handed us the menus, then just stood there waiting to take our order. Usually I'd asked for a few minutes, but this time I decided not to say anything. A couple of minutes passed and I could hear her sighing. That's when I decided to start reading from the menu again ... from the beginning. Thanks for making your customers feel they chose the right place to eat tonight.

RIce is good, not exceptional. It is of a smaller shorter grain. The roasted chicken is better than the steamed chicken, which is quite dry in my opinion. The sauces were given on those small trays and it is very hard to get the attention of the servers to give me more sauce. I asked once and was not given the extra sauces that I asked for. I did not try other dishes. Hence, my review is purely based on the chicken rice & the service only, I will not come back to Balestier just for Loy Kee chicken rice because about 100 metres away, there is Boon Tong Kee, which is way better than this."

I have eaten here probably 15-20 times over the past 6 months. The quality is consistently great and for a restaurant where they serve you, it is frankly underpriced, probably because they are making a dish that is so abundantly available at hawker centers.In and of itself, this place is awesome. The roasted chicken rice is tender and juicy. The bok choy has a lot of those crispy onions on it. They must cook the rice in coconut oil or something for it to taste that good. The only mild downside is that I often want more of the condiments than they give on the tray, especially the thick black vinegar."

But now it has since expanded to Changi and now Novena, the queues are not as bad as it used to be.I happened to walk past the outlet at Novena. The queues only had about 6 customers in front. Maybe because it already 9pm, right the peak dinner time. The queue moved quite fast and the staff at the counter was friendly.I decided on the 3 pieces Chicken Joy meal which costs $9.50. It came with a drink and a side. For side there choices of plain rice, french fries, mashed potato and buttered corn. For drink, there was various choices such as Pepsi, 7-up, Mug and mountain dew.The chicken pieces were available in 2 flavours : original and spicy. I had selected the original. The chicken pieces were quite chunky and meaty.The fried chicken went quite well with the brown gravy sauce."

The smoke was a cool gimmick, but the cocktail needs to still be drinkable and in this case it wasn't. And the quote objectifying women on the mirrored wall was a bit of a turnoff (""Men:  No clothes, no drinks; Ladies"" No clothes, free champagne""), especially for a bar going for such a classy, hipster vibe.  Not super cool.  Still, liked the place and will probably come back on my next visit to Sg."

The safer way to tell which stall is good will be by how long the line is.I only tried the food twice since the renovation. But based on what I had, I liked the Yu Kee Yong Tau Foo very much. I have always like this brand and only had it at Bishan outlet and the old food court at Orchard Emerald. So I am very happy it is available here.The items are standard, different from the other yong tau foo stalls, with 5 pieces of tofu and fish ball/fish cake and the noodles are topped with minced meat. I like the set which includes a side of kang kong drizzled with fermented bean curd. So yummy. The soup is also very sweet and tasty.The mee pok stall is also different with fish maw in it. It is not the best bak chor mee but it is decent. Good choice for Orchard Road. The or luak (oyster omelette) was also nice, especially the chili. Skip the Korean ginseng chicken soup which was very bland.Currently there is a 10% discount if you show your passion card."

You will be welcomed by a variety of cuisines and sometimes an overwhelming crowd. I try to come here for lunch around 11am to beat the usual lunch crowd. Queue's are shorter, and more seats to choose from. My favorite is the fish stall where they serve a variety of ways of cooking fish-deep fried and soup. I tried the deep fried dory twice and it was just ok but when I had the soup dish, it's the constant thing that I order every time I'm here. Also, when it comes to beverages, I don't need to come up to the drinks kiosk, I can just wait for auntie to pass by with her cart of refreshing drinks. One time when I was trying to veer away from the usual lime juice that I order, auntie was really helpful in suggesting other drinks and I opted for the lychee-just to try something new.When you come here, and it happens to be crowded, remember to look for more seats through those corridors and not just settle on the seats you see.

The folks from the Breadtalk Group really know how to make a difference with their food courts - which gives them such an edge above the rest. Each food court has a theme - though most of it relates to our Singaporean heritage, there are some subtle differences. For the most famous Food Republic (and probably with the most expensive rent) it is all back to basics of our Singaporean food roots with the revamp this time round and they have decorated it with all types of vintage items from our past which gives it a really nostalgic flavour and makes it distinctly Singaporean, even if some of the stalls in there hail from different countries and serve other cuisines. It is after all our heritage to have a mishmash of everything. There is a total of 23 stalls, 3 mini restaurants and 1 kiosk. How's that for spoilt for choice? I need to eat at this food court whenever I am in town next time and not bother thinking about restaurants.I would recommend that you make a beeline for their Odeon Beef Noodles - where my favorite is the dry noodles that comes with soup that packs a punch. Otherwise there is always the safe choice of Thye Hong Hokkien noodles which made this branch famous in the first place when it first opened. People are still queuing to this date, which is good. Their Indonesian Padang stall also has rather hefty meals that is sure to fill up a hungry person or 10."

The ingredients are fresh, a little cold, but it enhances the experience (Cold Rojak... now that's an idea!).

The Taiwanese one - Forgot the name, but their claim to fame is beef noodle soups using thick noodles cut by hand.  Supposedly the method of cutting imparts superior texture to give a nice, chewy noodle.  We ordered both the beef dumplings and steamed pork dumplings from this place and they were both fresh and tasty.2. There was one stall that made Laksa (traditional noodle in soup) and Laksa Goreng (noodles only). I liked how they offered you the choice of noodle to use.  Laksa had the usual thin fish slices, shrimp, and some sort of shellfish (cockles perhaps?).  Flavors were bold and intense at the same time.3. Soup Guru(?) - My wife liked this one and went here a few times for traditional Chinese soups.  I liked how they described each soup in English and the traditional health benefits of each.4. They had an Indian restaurant (specializing in Biryani) next to an Indonesian restaurant (with their own special chicken set).  I tried the Chicken Biryani this time and its quite good. They gave a whole small bird with skin and all and a good side of rice and some pickled veggies, all plated on a banana leaf. The ""Biryani sauce"" was given as a side.  Overall it was good - a little different than Biryani I've had here in the USA, but still good.5. Sergeant Chicken - they offered both steam and roasted Hainanese Chicken Rice here for just $4 SGD. I opted for the steamed version and was glad I did.  I never knew that such as a simple dish could have so much flavor.  The rice itself was seasoned with broth and you can always add more with the side of soup they gave you.  The chicken can be eaten with the minced ginger or with the spicy chili oil.6. The fruit juice place is pretty decent too.  They charge slightly more if you decline ice in the drinks.  Coconut juice is actually a whole baby coconut with a good amount of juice and coconut meat to chew on.  The mango and guava(?) are also good with the right amout of tart to help sooth a spicy meal.  I think one of the ladies working here also preloads a bunch of the drinks onto a cart and sells them by bringing the drinks throughout the court - which is really efficient.Our least favorite stall is probably the Fish Porridge one on the corner.  My wife expected a nice smooth congee but instead got this clear soup with cooked rice and fish meat mixed in."

Pasta is pretty tasty with mussels and prawns paired with tomato sauce.Seafood Marinara - $13.90Adding $4.90 to my pasta for set of additional soup of the day and 1 soft drinks. I had the Cream of Brocoli with garlic bread by the side of the double layer bowl. The soup was not quite hot, however still able to warm up the tummy.The environment did leave a good impression.

Also insist in sitting inside even if they tell you they are fully booked and you have to sit outside. was told the reservation would be in an hour but my Gf and I finished our meal in 20mins. yet when a party of 6 walked in just like us, they managed to get seats inside on the ""reserved""  tables. disappointed that they are so inconsistent on thisWould come back again as it's one of the better options in the Tanjong Pagar/Outram Park food places."

I saw many good reviews about the seafood marinara so I wanted to try it out , I thought it would be normal to the others but wow , when I tried , one word ; AWESOME ! I just love the flavor of the rich tomato base . And is worth it cuz they give the portion just nice for you . And the pasta is just too QQ and soft . The prawns is cooked perfectly . But I don't quite like the ice lemon tea , cuz when I tasted , is like its comes from the normal can . I thought it would be homemade . But overall 10/10 !

It was crispy and quite flaky.The chicken mulligatawny soup was both sour and salty. I'm not sure how to describe it but it had a pleasant taste. Then was Bharwan aatish khumbh - tandoori Mushrooms with nuts and cheese. It had a wonderful mix of flavours and a rich nutty taste. It was a bit sweet - which the manager had informed us about when we ordered. So it's not for everyone.We also had the murgh korma - chicken in a slightly sweet, mild rose cashew sauce. I was surprised by how mild it was. It seemingly had no chilli, and just a bit of pepper. I could even taste the rose. It was very pleasant and more subtle than Indian food usually is (though it'll probably be derided by purists). One thing to note is that a good cut of chicken was used, whereas lower end Indian places use cheaper cuts. This isn't necessarily a good thing, since the meat loses some moistness and flavour.To accompany our dishes we had butter roti and lachhna paratha (layered paratha). They were pretty good but they were not hot and the former did not have any palpable liquefied butter. In short, they were a bit old. I told the manager who claimed all the food was made only upon ordering. Well...We also had mango lassi which was excellent with a very intense mango taste.The service was not so good unfortunately. I asked for water and the server forgot. Only when I told the manager did it come. The mushrooms also only came upon my reminding the staff.

I highly recommend the lamb chops masala. Dishes are served with rich, velvety sauces. I suspect a lot of ghee goes into these offerings. As a result, the wife and I usually choose to walk home from Curry Culture to battle the inevitable food coma."

After reading lots of great reviews about this place, we decided to dine here on a Friday night. Getting reservation was easy as we were here an hour before it's closing time. We were seated promptly outside and the server was quick enough to take our orders. We had samosa and papdi chaat as our appetizers. The papdi chaat was better of the two.. very tasty with right amount of tanginess, spices and chilly! The samosa was also good but I enjoyed the chaat more. I often judge an Indian restaurant by the kind of chaats they make. I was in the mood of having some cocktail which will be spicy yet having the good liquor .. the waiter knew perfectly my want and served me the India summer- cocktail with whiskey and spices.. it was the perfect drink I needed on a Friday night. A must try drink if you enjoy some spices! The main course- aloo paratha, Channa masala, tandoori roti and aloo gobi was spot on.. very tasty, flavorful and true to its kind. Definitely fabulous dining experience. The service was excellent and a perfect ambience to have dinner with friends. Next time will love to try non- veg dishes as they seem to be excellent!"

I could drink it all the time, except for the fact that it's so hot here, and that the pub is outdoors, with very little cooling.  They also carry some nice craft beers from the world including some of my faves (Rogue, La Trappe, etc) as well as sake, whiskey and shochu.  JiBiru also specializes in yakitori, and the chicken skewer I had was very tasty - perfectly cooked chicken with just the right amount of char and with a sauce that wasn't overly salty or sweet.   The one thing that could improve here is the service though.  With the number of people working here, I found the service to be strangely inattentive or rather focused on one table only  Maybe they were celebs?  No idea, but in any case, JiBiru is a great place to see what Japanese craft breweries are doing these days with some tasty food to boot."

I was pretty disappointed with there Japanese craft beers. I had a sampler of 4 out of 5 different types, I didn't care for any of them. I then tried a Mocha Amaretto beer they had in a bottle, took about 3 sips then bought a different beverage. The last drink I tried was a mango Apple cider which was actually really refreshing being that it is only outdoor seating in Singapore weather. I tried the smoked duck breast(really bland), the Mochi cheese age( not bad when paired with duck breast), and the Curry croquettes. The curry croquettes are to die for, definitely would recommend them with the cider. All else I wound pass on."

Some of these beers cannot even be found in the Japanese supermarkets around! One of our favorites is the chocolate bottled beer, but it comes in only seasonally. It has a really nice packaging, like what you expect to get on a Japanese beer. This little bar started along with the starting of the mall, and has since updated its menu with a good amount of food items, and expanded the choice of imported beer. This I think is a really good sign for any business, having business owners are willing to progress and make changes for the consumers. I guess they have figured out that Singaporeans still like to munch while drinking. However on the downside, the staff are not very attentive. They will not attend to you until you go and take a seat yourself, from several of my personal experiences. Perhaps it is their style of service, but I cannot really get used to it. Environment wise, I actually like the open atmosphere. That's when I can do my favorite activity - people watching! Perfect spot to chill and watch people as they walk along."

I had tried similar elsewhere but there is no comparison. 2) Baked Honey BBQ Pork Pastry - This pastry was another item here that was the best compared to many other establishments which offered the same. The crust was buttery and flaky in a good way. I only despise flaky when it is associated to humans. The filling was generous with savory honey BBQ pork. 3) Char Siew Bun or Stream BBQ Pork Bun - The buns were so fluffy :9 The fillings which were honey BBQ pork were savory and so good.4) Steam Cheong-Fun with Honey BBQ Pork fillings - Rice flour rolls which were thin and soft. This is how it should be. It was light, healthy and tasted good.5) Deep-Fried Prawn Dumplings with Salad Cream- Generous and fresh prawn fillings in every of the dumplings. The dumplings' skins were so thin and crispy ;D  AMBIENCE 5/5No tacky décor but elegant beautiful surrounding. Comfy plushy chairs, nice table settings and lots of seatings. SERVICE 5/5Jorrine the hostess at the door had been working here for years. I recognized her. Always friendly and hospitable. She led me to one of the room inside. The server Shaun took very good care of me the moment I sat down. He was very pleasant, well-mannered and attentive. Taste Paradise has never let me down.

This is truly a well deserving 5 stars establishment in Singapore and ranked the top among all the 5 stars restaurants I rated."

Ordered three items: baked bbq pork bun, soup dumplings, and shark fin soup. I liked the pork bun and soup dumplings. The pork bun dough was crisp on the outside and the meat inside had a lot of flavour. The wrapper is thin and strong that holds the soup and meat well, that's how you know it's good wrapper. It was my first time eating shark fin soup. The soup was light and there's a huge dumpling that holds all the meat. The shark fins all dispersed when I opened the dumpling. All in all, it was a good experience."

Opted for the Peking Duck, Wasabi Prawns, and Foie Gras appetizer which was just heavenly! Peking duck was perfectly crispy and the wasabi Prawns was flavored to perfection. The foie gras was decent. Entrees included the salted egg prawns which consisted of a dozen or so juicy and flavorful prawns lightly fried and then dipped in salted egg yolk. Yum!The US beef with Gai Lan was also excellent. ...it was rather odd having US beef in Singapore. ...trust me on this one!Next came the Kurobata Pork with mushrooms which was also heavenly! Super tender pork in a world class gravy. Ended off the meal with Lobster with XO sauce noodles and their famous mango pomelo sago. Lobster was delicious and their XO sauce was on point.

If I would have to classify it, this is a fine dining Chinese restaurant. Extensive, but well appointed decor throughout, clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant. Very comfortable sitting, nice tablecloth - all sets you in a mood. To prove that this is a fine dining restaurant, it offers a great wine selection, which includes practically all first growth Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Mouton Rothschild, ...), as well as Petrus, Massetto, DRC and if I was not mistaken, even a cult California Screaming Eagle. We had 2011 Rauzan-Sègla with our dinner, and the wine was outstanding after 20 minutes in the glass. Excellent service, starting with wine and food pairing recommendations. Considering our choice of wine, we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of Peking duck, as crispy duck is less sweet - and the recommendation was spot on, excellent pairing - also the duck was cooked perfectly. We also had tofu and green beans, each dish is excellent on its own. One of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce. We also had the dessert - fresh mango purée with an ice cream, which is also beautifully presented on top of cold steaming bowl - another high point of the dinner experience.Once again, excellent service - prompt, attentive, helpful and friendly. Definitely recommended."

Because I can definitely get used to this.First, let's start with their impeccable service. The servers here are polite, friendly and actively try to engage in conversation. They see you as an actual person rather than just another customer, constantly checking in to make sure everything is up to standards.Their interior is very similar to hotel restaurants you find in mainland China, with revolving round tables and private VIP rooms. Their food might come out a bit slow, but it's worth it given the fantastic quality. The shark fin soup is best I've had anywhere. Clear, crisp broth with subdued flavoring that enhances the shark fin rather than overpowering it (which is something I've experienced on numerous occasion in the past). The spring roll that comes with it also adds another element in the texture department, with the flaky, crispy shell playing foil to the soft fins. Their garlic fried and boiled lobster was also delicious, offering two interesting takes on the classic lobster dish. The fried pieces weren't overly greasy, and had enough meat to counterbalance the shell. The boiled meats, however, were the real creme de la creme. Served in a butter garlic sauce, each tender piece of meat melted the moment it entered your mouth, delivering an explosion of flavor. Among the other dishes, I thought their Peking duck was cooked perfectly, though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking. Their braised pork cubes and steak bits were also pretty good, though a bit on the fatty side. In terms of drinks, there was nothing too standout, so I'd recommend just sticking to Tiger. All in all, a fantastic dining experience at one of my favorite places in Singapore."

They still serve dim sum at that time. Yay!We ordered the usual char siew so, which is extremely delicate and crispy! It is a must order dish here. Next, came the XO carrot cake, which I heard so much about. It tastes good and the carrot cake is chunky. I think another place which may be better than here or on par is at Chinatown's Spring Court. I honestly, couldn't be bothered with taking photos subsequently cuz the food was just too delicieus to ignore. We had the braised foie gras in blueberry reduction! It is super yummy!!! I would say it is basically foie gras terrine with blueberry jam! Crackling pork belly could be one of the best served in Singapore. I could have a whole plate to myself.

Crispy and crunchy skin with tender flesh and a sliver of fat, not too much, just enough to be justifiable for those counting calories.Whilst most rave about dim sum here (best dish in my humble opnion is mango prawn, not quite the traditional favourite, but the best one for me), I thought their usual fare was more impressive. Winter melon soup was served steaming hot in a hollowed out winter melon, a little corny but may be the reason it tasted better than others. Cod was very well cooked and it made my day that my mango sago came with a trailing smokey stream of dry ice; for only $4.50, I was getting all the fireworks.The restaurant is lavishly decorated, typical of chinese opulence but with just a touch of modernity. It may annoy you that the wait staff continuously stress that you can only stay for 45min/1hr/1.5hr before you have to vacate your table, but service is prompt and attentive, and the quality of food easily makes up for everything else."

They do at least two seatings at lunch.The Carrot Cake is excellent. A re-interpretation of a hawker favourite. And well interpreted, I think. The addition of succulent bean sprouts is so welcome.The roast pork (siew yoke) was recommended to us. It comes in a slab that has been cut down to look like it came out of a factory. It was okay, but for me, nothing remarkable in the way it was done.The roast duck was good, if you like a roast duck that is trying to be a chicken. ie a little too juicy. I prefer duck that is like duck - allowed to be a little drier. But that's just a personal thing. It is very high quality, with crisp skin.Between two roasts, take the duck.There's some mango dim sum thing, fried and with too much mayo. To me, unless you are a huge mayo fan, it was cloying and just too mayo-ey. Why did Singapore ever think mayo and mango is a good combination? Or mayo and prawn? Ugh!There's also a laksa bean curd dim sum dish. It was all right.Chee Cheong Fun also okay.I like that there's an attempt at incorporating local dishes/flavours rather than just offering standard Cantonese dim sum.It's a pity that during the day time the curtains are drawn and you can't see outside. So it feels like it's night time at Ion. And some of the placement of tables is quite awkward."

The spare ribs in sweet sauce is the first dish that comes to mind - caramelised sauce hangs off succulent tender meat that you won't be able to get enough of. The tasty crackling skin of the peking duck wrapped in thin popiah sheets is also probably one of the best I've ever tasted in Singapore. Another must-try would be the perfectly baked cod that simply melts in your mouth.

Food : M and I are fans of the salted egg yolk custard bun! Taste Paradise offers one of the best salted egg yolk buns in Singapore ... my only gripe is that they only offer the steamed version and not the deep fried mantou version at Man Fu Yuan. Their har gau (shrimp dumplings) and siew mai (pork dumplings) are very fresh and well executed. May, the manager of Taste Paradise informs us that they are made fresh every morning. I really liked the prawn mango roll which is encased in a lightly crumbed roll instead of beancurd skin. Mayonnaise is also thoughtfully included in the roll, so it all oozes out nicely in one moreish bite. The char siew sou (puffs) are really quite awesome, good meat to pastry ratio and the latter is light, buttery and flaky. The carrot cake with XO sauce is not bad but I prefer the one at Space @ My Humble House. The steamed beancurd skin with bacon rolls are pretty awesome as well but the wu kok (deep fried yam puffs) don't taste as good as they look. The double boiled soups are also excellent ... very tasty and great for a cold day. The dessert of aloe vera with ice jelly and wolf berries is extremely refreshing too.Ambience : I like how they have private rooms so one can request for them if one chooses not to be caught up in the hustle and bustle in the main dining hall. The layout is a bit labyrinth-like but nice modern Chinese decor with pictures of the different emperors from various dynasties in the private rooms. Service : Prompt, polite and overall perfect. May runs a tight ship and trains her staff well.Will be back for dinner soon!"

In terms of what they offer, it is a blend of dim sum and various Asian Fusion dishes. How this restaurant works is that you wait to be seated, they give you the menu, and then you check off what you want on the smaller paper menu that is sitting at each table. The main menu has a lot of photos so if you're not quite sure what you want to eat it's pretty easy to get a clearer perspective of what that may be.This restaurant can get very crowded, so don't expect the staff to be highly aware of your presence and cater to all of your needs. Meaning, you really have to ask them to come over if you want to get any service. Though, once they get there, they are fairly efficient in doing their job. In terms of interior design, there are numerous tables throughout this restaurant. Many of them are situated very close to one another. Personally, I like a little space when I eat so I can enjoy my meal and my conversation with the person I am dining with. But, due to the fact that Masa's tables are fairly close to one another, you may have somebody sitting elbow-to-elbow with you, depending on where they actually seat you. Just keep this in mind, because this may not be the atmosphere you wish to dine in.Overall, the food here is pretty good and it is an easy place to get to and grab a quick meal."

I visited this location back in March 2017.I love how this was a simple, fast, breakfast place that serves a hearty food. My mom and I ordered and our meal showed up maybe 5 minutes later. I got pre-set menus that came with Kaya toast and a soft boiled egg. Fishball noodle soup. Yum!This place is where locals grab a quick bite to eat before they move on with their day. It's seat yourself but could also end up sharing tables. It's semi outdoor seating so if you're into A/C, this might not be the location for you. I think tissues are 30 cents so remember to bring your own. After you're done, you can walk off your breakfast through the strip of nicely air conditioned malls!"

Before I texted my sis before to go ahead and order first. A bespectacled server came to me, demanded rudely that if I was not planning to eat anything, I must put on a mask. Was she kidding?? Why must she be so rude?? I countered back ""Yea!! I am eating!!"" During Phase 2 after the ""Circuit Breaker"" (aka shelter in place"", everyone in Singapore still needs to wear a mask when they are out and about. People can now dine in restaurants with social distancing procedures in place. Back to that server, why must she used that kind of tone to talk to me, a customer?? Ugh.. again I have to say this.. is it that hard to be polite to paying customers (Reminded me of that rude server at TCC restaurant @ Marina Bay Sands last year) ? Where was her service or manners?? She should simply say this:   ""Hi there! Sorry, if you do not plan to be eating, would you please put on your mask? Thank you for your understanding!""It is NOT that hard!!!!! My sister just asked me to eat whatever she ordered which were already served at the table. I may not kick a big fuss there, I surely not going to let this slide. I would throw hands the next time I visit there. I really wanted to try the soufflé pancake!My mood was ruined but I had to say the seafood pancake was really good! There was also this basket of korean chickens which was not bad either. The ginseng ade was really good!Ambience here is definitely 5 stars. Service was a 0 (the owner should thank their rude staff).

Because of dietary restrictions, I either avoid sandwich shops unless they have a low or no carb option. Although it is not on their menu, Rebel owners Wei Li and Sandy and their team are there to listen to your dietary needs and customize with their products.They listened and surprised me with a huge and delicious bowl packed with vegan and meat proteins, fresh vegetables and avocado. Vegan chicken nuggets are genius. They eerily tasted like chicken in flavor and texture. The tempeh is textuurrific! It has a satisfying bite and chew. I loved eating these with their Nuclear spicy sauce. The omelette perfectly fine cooked, great consistency and taste. I enjoyed their fresh, chunky rich avocado and Vietnamese julienned daikon radish and carrot pickle. This went so went with the chicken patties. The Thai chicken patty had notes that hinted of Thai fishcake. The Vietnamese chicken tastes like the meats in a Banh Mi sandwich. The cilantro brought those flavors together. There are no fillers and icky additives in their patties or other products. They at in the process of getting their restaurant certified halal.I also tried their delicious soups. I had the tomato soup and the mushroom soup. The tomato is good, but the mushroom is divine, the I-CANNOT-STOP-MYSELF divine. They are served with seasoned breadsticks which act as spoons. The reduce the use of disposable silverware. They gave me one because I don't eat bread. Wei Li and Sandy took the time to check on their customers and tell their story.

The portion size for the large is quite generous, and was definitely filling for me. The salmon and salmon belly were both very flavorful and had a nice texture. I wasn't a huge fan of the other fish, but they tasted pretty decent. The ikura was a bit too fishy for me though.- Aburi Kaizen Chirashi Don: This is the same as the Kaizen Chirashi Don, except the fish are all seared a bit. This is more expensive, and I overall felt the regular bowl was better. The searing tastes off a bit too much of the flavor for some of the fish.- Sake Sashimi: 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. Very tasty but was a bit pricey for the portion.Service:No problem with the service, but be prepared to wait if you come at peak times. I came on a weekday and the restaurant was nearly full (with a lot of reserved tables already).Price: $$/$$$The Chirashi Dons were both $26.90, though the normal one was a Large size and the Aburi one was a regular size.

Overall, the service was super quick and food appeared almost instantly.I will join the choir and sing praise for their kaisen chirashi don: it really is as amazing as you read in the reviews (and the reviews of their other location). The fish was amazing, the slices were thick and super fresh. I had trouble finishing the normal size don (granted I had a late and rather big lunch) which is a first!Highly recommended!"

Yes I've heard about this place also having one of the most worth it chirashi sets at a good price. Well... Everyone was right! As seen on Yelp, I went for the popular items right away - the scallop mentaiko carpaccio to share, I had the premium chirashi and my friend being a smaller eater had the normal chirashi. The premium chirashi even came with uni inside with big and plump ikura! Everything was generally very fresh, however the prawn was a bit slimy and strong tasting to be absolutely honest. Everything else was to expectation and a little above, given the great feedback all over the Internet. One thing about this place that really stuck out was their stuff which are aburi-ied (flame torched) ! Anything that they flame torched wasn't just for show. It really does bring out that extra flavour! They seemed like masters at it. Even down to the scallop mentaiko carpaccio! That smokey flavour.... I miss it already!They seem to have a chirashi bowl that is all aburi (torched on one side and raw behind)! I absolutely can't wait to go back and try that! I'm giving this outlet 4.2 out of 5 stars! Would have been slightly higher if it weren't for that lousy prawn! ;)"

Blasphemy, I know!  I find that the food selection here is a lot more extensive than the original. The Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, which in my view, is the STAR dish of this restaurant, is not available at the original location, from what I remember. Second, the Ngee Ann City space is far larger and has much more of a restaurant feel than the hole-in-the-wall experience at the original location. Third, the queue is a tad bit shorter.  In any event, the aburi dishes are the real winners of The Sushi Bar, separateing them from every other sushi restaurant in Singapore. I'm not familiar with the term ""aburi"", but from what I understand, it is essentially grilled/torched raw fish. The Sushi Bar has perfected the art of torching high quality sushi, leaving the edges burnt with the inside nice and raw. Simply, an awesome combination. In short, depending on whether you fancy chirashi or sushi, you should order either the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, Salmon Aburi Roll or both!"

Service, however, is brusque and sullen. The aburi salmon roll they are famous for is flavourful at first bite. The dollops of mayo on top lends it sweetness and creaminess, with a touch of saltiness that accentuates the other flavours. However, once you remove the dollop of mayo on top, the roll itself is extremely average. Though fatty and plump, the salmon itself is not particularly flavourful. The filling of avocado and crab stick and lean maguro don't contribute much in terms of flavour too. So I would say the star of the dish is the mayo! :)  There are better quality sushi options out there at a similar price point."

The gf was craving Chee Cheong Fun and I suddenly thought of this place. Now this is a place that lives up to its name! We went for a standard Char Siew (sweet roasted pork) Cheong fun, a mushroom Cheong Fun, Century Egg And pork porridge and the raw fish. First the raw fish. I love my raw fish. I adore it. I crave for it but this one.... This one disappointed me a little. Not that is wasn't fresh but well;,. Firstly they use a different fish. I believe the regular market/food Centre 鱼生 (raw fish) uses Ikan Parang while this one tasted like snapper fillets. No that I'm complaining about the texture, but what bothered me was the additional Acar. A) I'm not a big fan of Acar to begin with and b) I think the sweetness from the Acar spoils the dish. Gone was that salty, sour (from the lime) 鱼生 dish that I loved. Next came the porridge. What I loved about the porridge here was how thick it was! Unlike the usual ""as-smooth-as-you-can"" style of Cantonese porridge houses, this place likes their porridge chunky and if you're a fan of century egg like we are, you have to do the $1.00 add-on for century eggs. What you'll get in return is a century egg porridge packed with so many pieces that you're guaranteed at least 1 piece egg with every spoon. Next came the 2 Cheong funs. The mushroom Cheong fun was alright. It was a play safe option since we couldn't decide on what to order after the Char Siew. The char Siew on the other hand was really nice. Char Siew wasn't dry and they used a good mix of fat and meat. But what really stood out for both dishes were how soft the Cheong fun itself was! Picking up with chopsticks alone was a challenge and when popped in the mouth, you get this wonderfully light smooth texture that almost melts in your mouth. Definitely one of the best Cheong funs I've had in a while. Overall... This place was worth the short walk in the sun but it could be quite warm if you're lunching there. We'll be back to try their other unique Cheong funs like cheese and lobster and abalone."

I had the boat version since I had no idea what that included and wanted to try something new. Maybe that was my mistake. Nothing special.I do have to admit that the cheung fun was delicious though! The made-to-order rolls were so fresh and tender with a good bite to the rice sheet.  Tried the cha siew and fresh prawn flavors - both good but I enjoyed the latter more.  They had a lot of advertising for their special durian flavored cheung fun but I didn't end up trying it.  I generally like to eat my durian as is and not cooked into anything.Overall an ok place but also a tad more expensive than a usual small shop like this.

The century egg porridge is very average and unremarkable, but I find the chee cheong fun is damn delicious!!

Nope; we're west and north of the target these folks are aiming for. But with a base of good Tex-Mex and some farther south-of-the-border influences, it was just what this culinarily homesick guy needed to restore my faith in civilisation, at least until I get hungry again. That won't be for a while... the portions aren't huge by norteamericano standards, but by Singapore standards generally, they're more than respectable. I was starving when I sat down and decided I really wanted comfort food after all, so I had the beef chimichanga... and could barely finish it. (People who know me, and too many who don't, have heard me complain for years about how stingy most restaurants here are with their portions, unless you're paying four-star-or-higher prices.)Ditto to what others have said about the jalapeños. I haven't had peppers that good in years. Also ditto to what others have said about the service; when we came in in a group of five, the place was at what looked like the end of early-supper rush, and we felt very welcome. Professional, attentive, patient and flexible service very unlike far too many places I've been here the last few years.If you go in expecting authentic Juárez or Tampico-style cooking, you're going to be disappointed. If you think this is going to be a slightly more upscale Chili's with better Tex-Mex, you're close, but in for a (pleasant) surprise. I know I'll be back, and at least 3 of the 4 others in my party (with varying levels of exposure to the cuisine in general) were also enthusiastic.Notice how all the positive reviews are from Americans or Americans-turned-locals and the negative reviews are from born locals (at least as I write this)? If you live here a decade or so, you'll understand; until then, if anybody knows better food for the money, it's news to me."

I will also note that on their site, Viva Mexico claims to be  traditional Mexican food and not Tex-Mex.  While they have some moles, from what I saw of their menu, it is mostly Tex-Mex.  Plus, the fajitas seem to be pretty popular.  They are as Tex-Mex as it gets.My goal was to find a place that served decent US chain (El Toritios, etc..) quality Tex-Mex food.  My mission was a success.  In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is.  This is true from the ambiance to the food.Speaking of the ambiance; it is festive.  Well, it is in the festive get out the decorations for taco night sort of way.  But it sets the mood for having a margarita or two.  And speaking of margarita's theirs are pretty good.  Nothing to write home about, but good enough to keep the Viva Mexico mood going.  It seemed like everyone there was in good spirits and enjoying their meals.  For me, this was a nice plus to the overall ambiance.The staff was friendly, professional, and prompt.  This was maintained throughout our meal.  This even included a moment where the power went out.  But that was only a very minor hiccup.The food was quite good.Nachos - We started with some nachos.  We enjoyed them very much.  I sought out the jalapeños.  My friend did everything she could to eat around them.  The chips were crisp.   The cheese was all melted.  This is all just as it should be.tinyurl.com/bz5eu8nGuacamole - We also ordered a side of guacamole.  This was also very good.  There were lots of fresh ingredients.  They had also insured not to over mix it so there was still some texture.tinyurl.com/aleeo7jFajitas - I ordered chicken.  She ordered beef.  I thought both were good.  I love fajitas.  I love food where you get to do a little bit of combining and playing while eating.  Being her first adventure with fajitas, my friend did not embrace this part as much.  She abandoned the create your own fajita taco and stuck with the fork and knife.  I thought that both the chicken and beef were cooked well.  They were both tender and had nice seasoning.  The veggies were still very crispy.  All in all -  two good sets of fajitas.tinyurl.com/abmcj9qOverall - This was a fun meal.  The food was good.  The service was pleasant.  The ambiance was on the festive side.  Good stuff!  I will be back."

Hell to the no. Is this the best TEXMEX in Singapore? Hell to the YES! I came here on a Friday night with Michelle M. and there was a small band jamming and singing in Spanish! What a perfect way to start our TexMex adventure. We ordered nachos, crab enchiladas, beef burrito, and beef tacos. I didn't try the beef burrito, but the crab enchiladas and beef tacos deserve an ole! The enchilada sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but it definitely tasted like enchilada sauce so me gusta! It didn't taste much different from Chevy's enchiladas, which I faintly recall. Plus, the nice chunks of crab meat gave it a distinctive local flavor. Kind of like chili crab but no need for messy hands or a bowl of lemon water. The tacos are also worth the $17 as the price included 3 soft shelled tacos, rice, refried beans, and a small salad. Not bad considering Lucha Loco charges $11 for just one taco. The refried beans were also delicioso, def. an item I'll order as a side or even as an appetizer. I'm no nacho lover, but Viva Mexico's nachos blew me away. They came with REAL jalapenos! Nice big, fat vinegary ones!   ¡Salud! I was so happy I almost burst into tears...do you know how difficult it is to find jalapenos in Singapore?? My homemade Mexican food just doesn't taste the same without them. Viva Mexico (and Subway, I guess), tell me who your distributor is, por favor! I need them jalapenos! This certainly isn't the best TexMex I've had in my life, but for Singapore, I'm thoroughly impressed. For the price, atmosphere, and food--me encanta!

I will also note that on their site, Viva Mexico claims to be  traditional Mexican food and not Tex-Mex.  While they have some moles, from what I saw of their menu, it is mostly Tex-Mex.  Plus, the fajitas seem to be pretty popular.  They are as Tex-Mex as it gets.My goal was to find a place that served decent US chain (El Toritios, etc..) quality Tex-Mex food.  My mission was a success.  In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is.  This is true from the ambiance to the food.Speaking of the ambiance; it is festive.  Well, it is in the festive get out the decorations for taco night sort of way.  But it sets the mood for having a margarita or two.  And speaking of margarita's theirs are pretty good.  Nothing to write home about, but good enough to keep the Viva Mexico mood going.  It seemed like everyone there was in good spirits and enjoying their meals.  For me, this was a nice plus to the overall ambiance.The staff was friendly, professional, and prompt.  This was maintained throughout our meal.  This even included a moment where the power went out.  But that was only a very minor hiccup.The food was quite good.Nachos - We started with some nachos.  We enjoyed them very much.  I sought out the jalapeños.  My friend did everything she could to eat around them.  The chips were crisp.   The cheese was all melted.  This is all just as it should be.tinyurl.com/bz5eu8nGuacamole - We also ordered a side of guacamole.  This was also very good.  There were lots of fresh ingredients.  They had also insured not to over mix it so there was still some texture.tinyurl.com/aleeo7jFajitas - I ordered chicken.  She ordered beef.  I thought both were good.  I love fajitas.  I love food where you get to do a little bit of combining and playing while eating.  Being her first adventure with fajitas, my friend did not embrace this part as much.  She abandoned the create your own fajita taco and stuck with the fork and knife.  I thought that both the chicken and beef were cooked well.  They were both tender and had nice seasoning.  The veggies were still very crispy.  All in all -  two good sets of fajitas.tinyurl.com/abmcj9qOverall - This was a fun meal.  The food was good.  The service was pleasant.  The ambiance was on the festive side.  Good stuff!  I will be back."

There's everything from Ramen to Sushi, and I think is great for families, because there's always something for everyone. My favorite for sure is AJISAI ramen! This place is quite small, so if you are coming here with 2+ people, I would recommend to first grab a table and then get your food. Another pro tip, is to first get your drinks before ordering the food. All drinks must be purchase from business #1."

Selfish, I know. My love for this joint however, has started to waver a little and in my own twisted way of thinking, I'm hoping if more people patronize the shop because they know about it, they'll tighten up the quality standards and everyone benefits.So why do i like Tsuru-Koshi? It's the only udon specialist restaurant that I know of my side of town (it's sad but true, but that's the crabby restaurant landscape in Singapore). It seems like a classic Japanese restaurant transplant that I imagine had some amount of quality control done by the OCD Japanese owner or his Singaporean equivalent. The noodles have always been cooked on the cusp of al dente and the tempura items fried crisp. Lastly, the prices are decent given where the restaurant is located and the portions for quality.What's wrong now? The restaurant is still by far the only means for me to get remotely Japan-standard udon in Singapore, short of going to one the high end places worthy of a business lunch. This place wouldn't stand out in Japan by any means, but for Singapore, it's great. However, on a visit yesterday, I noticed the cooks have become sloppy. The Asu Asu Tan Tan udon I normally order came in a little mess of a bowl - with the minced meat chucked to one side, the noodles un-artfully dunked in and the soft egg broken. The tempura sides we ordered - pumpkin, ebi and the fish cake tubes - left oily kisses on the tenshi. The latter is a cardinal tempura sin in my book. If I wanted a sloppy fry-up, I'd head to Smith's.So yes, this review is strange in that I am none too pleased about what's happening in the kitchen. But, the udon still beats the competition by far. So do me a favor, stop by and grab a bowl or two regularly and tell them to step it up, please? Or tell me if you know of any worthy alternatives."

I love cold udon in a simple soy sauce with lemon, but this time I opted for the ""hot spicy cold sauce with minced pork"" which was very delicious. My only complaint is that for 9 bucks, I was expecting more noodles. It's a good size for most girls in Singapore I think. And the egg was pretty good.

This is the 2nd K+B location with the first operating for a few months now at Leisure Park Kallang. The owners hope to open many more and franchise it throughout Asia. The pizza are delicious and because I'm a thin-crust fan, this place already has a ""pizza"" my heart. The crust has a little spring & chewiness to it so if you prefer a harder crust, you may not enjoy it as much. The sauce and topping options are very extensive and fresh, but the bacon is superb. Perfect size slices of real side pork, and not that dried baco-bit stuff many other places use.

I think the staff is cordial and efficient. The only difference is they will hand you a hot towel once seated to clean your hands? They also offer aprons and cloth to cover your bags on the chair. As reservations can be made for lunch, we didn't have to wait for a table and make use of their manicure services and fruits refreshment. You are given a tablet to order your food. Somehow ours was set to the Chinese language and unfortunately most of us could not read it and order. Finally a friend who can read it found there was an option to switch to English (upper right corner). They should consider putting ""ENG"" or something when the menu was in Chinese mode and in Chinese characters when in English mode so the monolingual can select the language option. Alternatively you can also flag down a wait staff for assistance. The food is good. Fresh and appetizing and of better quality. I did not expect cod in the seafood platter. The soup is also tasty and the Szechuan spicy soup (mala) is actually drinkable. It did get spicier after a while. Take out the chili to reduce the spice level or ask to top up the soup to dilute the spiciness. The chicken soup is delicious too. I am also surprised the cost is lower than expected. I thought it would be similar to Imperial Treasure Steamboat pricing (about $100+ for 2) but it turned out quite reasonable. Maybe it depends on what we ordered too. For a table of 5 girls, it came to around $140. We had a seafood platter, slice beef, beef balls, mushroom platter and vegetable platter. We did not add the self service free flow seasoning for $4++ each as we did not fancy the desserts or fruits. We were full with what we had, with room for dessert elsewhere.This is a comfortable place for hotpot but it is very crowded and so it is very noisy too. I still prefer to have steamboat at home but I will not mind returning if since reservations can be made. No way will I queue for this though. The usual wait time is about 2 hours or more. Another slightly cheaper option with equally fresh and good food will be Shi Li Fang at Orchard Central and Icon Village."

Many restaurants should take a leaf or two from them to really enhance diners experience. Secondly, their food items are really fresh and appetizing. I would like to specially mention the pork balls. They don't have the porky taste and each bite is QQ and full of flavour! Super win! I usually don't enjoy eating meatballs because so many people kill it for me. Their pork balls is currently my top ranking ones in terms of taste and texture! We chose the herbal black chicken soup base and their signature mala spicy soup base. I requested for really low level of spice as I don't know what to expect. Turned out it still packed quite a punch though it's low spice level. Their chicken soup is white and full of flavour. Even without anything in it, I could have drank bowls and bowls of it already! And to give them credit for using REAL stock, I didn't feel thirsty even after me drinking a lot of soup by the end of the meal. Dessert and condiments counter, we opted for this at an additional $4 per pax but to me, it's really worth it. Not only I can mix my own dipping sauce the way I like it, there is a nice selection of fruits and Chinese desserts. Today, they had rock melon and watermelon which were nice and sweet. As for the Chinese desserts, I enjoyed their chilled Beancurd and white fungus especially. All in all an excellent meal! Totally satisfied and already planning when to return again. Surely a sign of an excellent restaurant!"

Amazed that the waiting time can stretch up to 2-3 hours! But they try to make it less painful by offering free food, drinks, even manicures if you choose to wait. Instead we went window shopping and came back when we anticipated the table might be ready. We still had to wait about 20 mins despite being told our number was next in line. Can kill time by folding paper cranes to redeem a $6 dish haha. After being shown to our seats, we were offered a ziplock bag for our phones, aprons to cover our clothes etc. Thoughtful indeed. Ordered the ingredients we wanted over an ipad, and half portions were available. Our waitress helped us concoct a dipping sauce and also helped cooked some of the ingredients. I even saw her peeling prawns for the next table. Hot towels are also given for us to freshen up. Service indeed is one of the commendable highlights here. So now let's talk about the food. The tomato broth is indeed one of the yummiest soups they have offered. A slight sweetness that goes well with most of the ingredients. Also had the Szechuan mala one which I sometimes mixed with the tomato soup in my own bowl for that wonderful pairing. Appreciated the fresh seafood pastes (prawn, squid etc) and meat balls. At least the more premium pricing is justified by the fresh, non-processed ingredients. Also was treated to live noodle making show. After the yummy steamboat, there are still fresh fruits, sweet chinese tong sui and ice cream if you must have something sweet to end the meal. Pricing was about $50/pax which is a bit high for us tourists, but I think you pay what you get and this is a place definitely worth trying at least once! Go for the 4 soup option then haha. The only thing making me think twice is the waiting time.... but I did hear that they open until 3 or 5 am.... so supper option maybe?"

Everyone knows the service here is top-notch (hot towels, popcorn & herbal tea & fruits & manicures while you wait, ziploc bags for phones, aprons, hairties, etc), but I wouldn't come here if not for the amazing amazing food. For steamboat the broth is paramount and basically defines your meal. And the broth here has been consistently good. I always order the ma la with either the mushroom (they call it San Xian) or black chicken soup. No steamboat restaurant has the same reverence for and focus on the soup: it's served to drink alone with parsley and spring onion before you even add any ingredients, and on its own, it's already so addictive. It comes with ingredients too - actual black chicken, and two types of mushrooms & fishballs for the mushroom one. I am a huge fan of ma la tang, and the one here is tasty in itself, even after I scoop out most of the chili oil. It's actually drinkable !!!The dishes here are also fresh and inventive. You can order half or full portions - we usually order half portions and add on later if we like the dish. My faves: -Noodles - freshly spun and cut at your table. A rather small portion though, so order more if you'd like to enjoy more of this silky soft handmade la mian. -Pork and chives dumplings - YUM. Too many steamboat places are sloppy on their dumplings. The filling is fresh and juicy, while the skin tastes just like mee hoon kueh / like the la mian. Delicious. -Fish glue - my family loves this. It tastes very distinctly of fresh prawn here, compared to other places where it may taste more like fish or fish cake. -Meats like U.S. beef and black pork - thinly sliced and delicious on its own, even cooked in lighter soups like chicken/mushroom soup. The portions are not that large though, so savor them! -Meatballs - none of that tasteless frozen synthetic junk here. Tastes just like fresh meat. I'm also addicted to their chilled beancurd, served along with their sauces and condiments ($4 each). I'd usually balk at paying for this at some other steamboat restaurants but never hesitate at Hai Di Lao: besides the chilled beancurd (which is impossibly fine and soft and light and delicious and I eat maybe 5 portions each time), there're a few traditional cold dishes like peanuts and beancurd skin, fresh and actually very ripe fruits like watermelon and cut oranges, and a ridiculous display of sauces. Tbh I don't know why someone would have Korean gochujang or fermented beancurd sauce with steamboat...but definitely impressive variety. I feel like I need to say something bad about Hai Di Lao after raving for so long...so let me rack my head. Okay, it was a bit of a pain to make reservations because the line is often busy and can't get through. But just keep calling and make them, because you don't want to watch hungrily outside for 2 hours. I've never waited. This usually means I make reservations a few days or a week ahead. Of course Hai Di Lao is pricier than the usual run-of-the-mill steamboat restaurant. Orders of two types of broth already totals to more than $20 for the table. But it's not meant to compete with more casual places - Hai Di Lao offers a relaxed, quieter, more formal ambiance, where you can leisurely cook and sip at your soup and chat while enjoying your meal. IMO that's worth paying for occasionally, and frequently if you can afford it!"

They are pretty known for their service and quality of food. The service staff is generally very courteous and attentive. The usual practice is that after the soup boils, the service staff will offer to pour out some soup and add some gsrnishing for you before you actually cook your food. If you have trouble with the menu they will be more than willing to help you out. Also when you do order prawns, they will check if you'd like them to remove the shells for you and if you would like to have the prawn heads in the soup. I would say that the 313 branch is slightly less crowded and easier to get a table. They now have a new concept of small individual pot as an alternative to having one big pot with 2 separate soups. Price wise, it's slightly higher as they do provide more than just food, free manicure session for the ladies if you have to wait very long for a table and a kids playing area."

Portions are a little on the smaller side, but I'm told the noodles are in a bigger bowl now than a year ago. Wontons are still small, but the portion of brisket and tendon is fairly generous.

The noodle is excellent: very thin and elastic just like in Hong Kong. The deal-breaker for me was its broth which had an excruciatingly pungent aftertaste not dissimilar to foul ammonia smell (i can't remember if it was this bad in Hong Kong). This likely came from lye water used to make the noodles but the odd thing is the noodles tasted perfectly fine until i drank the soup which ruined the dish in one sip. I guess that's the price of admission for springy noodles.Shrimp dumplings, consisting of 1 slice of shrimp and some wood-ear mushrooms loosely packed together in wonton skin, were unimpressive. The bite does not offer sufficient flavor contrast and seemed to be missing a binder and thus fell apart easily upon consumption."

I forgot how the noodle was served in a regular rice bowl. I had the beef brisket with shrimp wanton noodle so the bowl was just slightly bigger. I felt the portion was small but I was not sure if it was because I was used to the bigger bowls served in Crystal Jade and Imperial Treasure. I would say the portion filled me up to 75% full so it was probably good if one wants to eat less or practice eating to 80% fullness. There were 4 wantons which was decent as some places would only give 2-3 wantons when you ordered a mix. The beef brisket could be more tender but it was not bad. The noodles were thin and chewy (Hong Kong style) and the soup was a tad too salty for me. The chili was strange, I would prefer the type served at Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure. I guessed the people has spoken. The noodle did not live up to its hype so there was no queue after 3 months of opening. It was still only half filled close to 12pm."

Broth was tasty, and noodles were well cooked and springy, but had a very strong lye water flavour that I dislike.

Unlike what my mother had commented, the portion was pretty reasonable (not too small). The noodles were stringy and on the side there was oyster sauce that you suppose to stir together with the noodles to increase the flavors. I tried the noodle first. Unlike another store I tried this week, it was pretty well cooked. It wasn't too soft or too hard to chew. The prawn wontons together with the soup were flavorful. Not as salty as I thought it might be.The Luo Han Guo drink was refreshing but I would probably try the other drinks the next time round.

I have to be honest here. I haven't been to Hong Kong in the last 20 years so it's very difficult for me to asses Mak's Noodles authenticity versus their Hong Kong counterpart.What I will do however, is compare it to other wanton noodles found in Singapore, based on either similar style or price range (so yes, no comparing to auntie lim or auntie choo's wanton Mee at xxx Coffee shop). Tossed Noodle with Shrimp Roe and Oyster Sauce. One of their signature dishes here, I found it leaning to the slightly saltier side. While the noodle was beautifully springy or ""Q Q"", the shrimp roe did end up making the dish a tad bit too smart for my liking. Braised Beef Tendon and Brisket Noodle Now this was a dish that I liked... A LOT!While still leaning slightly towards the salty side, the sauce added a great additional depth to the noodles. Coating the noodles with a smooth, rich and really beefy sauce (be warned, it is really really beefy), served with a fairly generous portion of brisket and tendon, this dish will make any meat lover happy! Wanton soupHow could we come to Mak's and not try their signature wantons. First impressions? A generously stuffed wanton!Nothing can be worse than a wonton with really thick skin and minimum ingredients and this wanton is not one of them. Smooth skinned with a really juicy filling, the wanton was a delight to have! Overall..... A very decent wanton restaurant. The noodles are a lot finer to what most people are used to and because of its springiness, might irritate diners by getting caught between the teeth (I should know, I got a few stuck throughout my lunch), but, however, it was still a good Plate of wanton noodles. Queues are managed well and staff are generally friendly. That said.... Is it a Michelin star restaurant? Hmmm maybe the Hong Kong one but certainly not the ones in Singapore and, it is slightly on the higher end of the spectrum when compared to competitors like crystal jade etc, but it's still generally a decent bowl of wanton Mee."

We especially LOVE hotpot BUT the broth here is on another level. We used to go to other location which is in Katong, too, but the broth quality there had gone down the drain. So.. this is the most consistent location we know. And by consistent, I mean that the soup is always of the same quality (never diluted) when it's served (before you added the extra ones from the bottles, of course).The most common broths that people get are the Ma La and Collagen. I personally love the collagen one so much and recommend everyone to order at least that one when they first come to visit. For the Ma La, it's really hot and this place definitely does the kick. There's also a large selection of ingredients to create your own sauces that you can mix n match to dip in your items. My friends usually mix some of the ingredients together for their tangy, spicy or garlicky sauces. In addition, they also provide fruits to end your meal. Some of the drinks are refillable and my favorite is the sweet & sour one.After you finish your meal, they tend to give you a small cup of sweetness to wash down your meal with as (or before) you pay along with free wet tissues. No spoilers, but this is a place to constantly experience especially on a cold day with your loved one; that's my bowl of happiness.On a side note, bookings are required especially on the weekend and there's always 20% OFF from 10:30pm onwards everyday."

Well it is mostly known to the office workers and retail shops people working nearby. So it is hidden only to the tourists and general shoppers in Orchard Road.Most people will flock to the food courts in Orchard Road (not much choices with Food Republic dominating most malls and the ever crowded one at Takashimaya) for cheaper eats. Some may head to Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza for the smaller local food outlets. Then you get this place.It is a staff canteen for Singtel employees working there but somehow it has open its doors to outsiders. It is a Godsend as the food prices are way cheaper than the places named previously. I only learned of its existence after my colleagues brought me there when I started working in the Orchard area. Apparently many construction workers and retail shop staff usually buy the food here as the portion is bigger at the cai fan stall and is relatively cheaper. There are two prices displayed for staff and non-staff. Generally you can get a full meal including a drink for $5 or less. The food is not the best but it is pretty decent.For cheap eats in the premium shopping belt, I'm in!"

The duck leg is cured overnight, slowly simmered for another 10 hours before pan-frying to yield a golden-brown crispy skin, encasing the tender and flavorful meat. Paired with braised red cabbage and sautéed potatoes.Nothing beats a whole pork knuckle to go along with some beer! Eisbein, a traditional German delicacy, features a whole pork knuckle marinated overnight with a special in-house blend, boiled for another hour and then glazed with a coat of apple vinegar to attain a crisp finish. Good for sharing!Have some Asian comfort food with the Dolsot Bibimbap. Mix in the homemade gochujang, a fermented condiment specially concocted by Korean Chef Kim, for a sweet, tangy and subtle chilli kick.The Taste of the World ala carte menu is available daily for both lunch and dinner at The Dining Room.

Very FEW choices, and Very BASIC make...DRINK ORDER offers, on the other hand were constant, and the alcoholic ones came fast.. Real problem with non-alcoholic drinks was that they had no idea what a Lemon, Lime & Bitters was.. Nor a Lime Soda..? We found this a little far-fetched...

Some highlights of the buffet includes an entire ice bar with seafood such as oysters, mussels, shrimps and crayfish. There's also various live stations manned by chefs who'll cut up sashimi, duck and cook pasta for you. The selection of hot food has dishes that ranges from Chinese, Indian, to Mediterranean. Since we went during the CNY period, besides the usual fresh vegetable for your pick of salad mixture, they also had ingredients for the traditional Lo Hei so you can make your own to do your little mixture and enjoy it with your friends/family for a more prosperous year ahead!The dessert bar is also really awesome with a good selection of cakes, tarts, pies and of course, dont forget to ask the chef for a chocolate lava cake! Waiting time is about 5mins so go make your order first, pick up some fruits and marshmallows to dip into the chocolate fondue then go back to collect your cake. To make the lava cake even better, you can add a scoop of ice cream or preserved fruits, whichever suits your palette more! Not into lava cake, you can also ask for a waffle instead.All in all, a really good experience. Yums and cheers to a great year to come!"

I thought the food was pretty yummy and fairly cheap.Be warned though, this place is somewhat similar to a Korean BBQ place in that you may end up coming out smelling of BBQ! Delicious, but perhaps not the best sort of perfume.. Anyway, here on a Sunday afternoon, fairly crowded, seemed to be quite populated with Filipinos. Service was fairly quick - although we did have to wait a little bit for our waters to get refilled.Grilled squid aka Inihaw na Pusit ($14.95) was delicious! Nice sauce and good char-grill taste. Not too chewy, nice bite to it. A bit too charred at some places - we were trying to scrape a bit off (avoid carcinogens.. plus completely burnt bits don't make for the nicest taste either).Bulanglang ($7.45) was pretty good too, hadn't had it before so it was definitely interesting. Mixed vegetables in a rather salty sauce (as long as you don't try to drink the sauce on its own you're fine - just be satisfied with it flavouring/clinging on to the veges!) I liked the eggplant, had a good roasted taste. Other veges include bittergourd (not a fan in general), pumpkin (ok, not that sweet), okra, long beans, some tomato/onion (yum!). Also, four pieces of grilled fish on top had pretty good flavour too!Garlic rice ($1.70) was nice, soft and flavourful; I bet a good amount of oil went in to making it moist/yummy. Haha. Oh well...Pinaputok na cream dory ($11.95) was also delicious! I thought 'cream dory' meant it was going to be creamy so I was a bit wary, but boy was I wrong. This dish came wrapped in a banana leaf (I love foods that are steamed/wrapped in leaves! They are usually scrumptious) and tasted pretty healthy (surprisingly, Filipino food isn't really something I associate with healthy living haha). Steamed veges (tomato/onion/leeks) with tender fish, mmm. Glad my dad picked it!"

Like most restaurants on the Cuppage Terrace, this place is tiny, there is plenty of seating outside but the restaurant itself is small. The food and the flavors are there. I tried the yellow curry and my colleague tried the spicy noodles. The yellow curry was not overpowering, very light, and very authentic. The other dish was spicy and hot yet he couldn't stop eating them it was that good. With such good we had to try the dessert, I wish I remembered the name of clicked a picture. It was the first one on the menu and looks like a sundae except much tastier with coconut milk, brown sugar on the side and green gummies. Again, I am not much of a dessert person, but I couldn't stop myself from finishing. We complimented the owner and chatted with him after dinner. Great conversation. Now to the not so good side of the restaurant. I hate to do this but has to be done. The service is poor. My companion was visually uncomfortable, and we asked for the water several times and the sweet sauce. Yet it took a solid 10 minutes with only one more table occupied in the restaurant. There is no tap water, and the place is expensive about $50+/person. At those prices, I would expect good service and least of all free water.

We chose Thai because we didn't feel like eating much and figured some Tom Yum would work. Service was spot on, but the soup we ordered medium spicy had fire coming out of our ears. It was replaced promptly, and the new ""mild"" version was hotter than the medium we're used to, but acceptable. The broth was tasty, but the high price wasn't justified by the paucity of solid food. Mine was shrimp, and there were just four of those puppies. My husband's chicken was hard to find. Two bowls of soup and nothing else came close to $40 with all the taxes/service charges. It's easy to find cheap food in Singapore, but you gotta stick to street food if you're on any kind of budget. Ginger Thai was okay, but not worth the money."

Food continues to be very special. Very very good. They were short handed this night with a full house. No one was flustered. Only 2 servers. Chef Denis even had to help with service. Nonetheless service was good. A little slow but why rush when you can take your time to savor the meal. This restaurant remains highly recommended. You will not be disappointed food and service wise.

I've been itching to try Singapore's infamous Kaya Toast and luckily, Toast Box was only a few minutes away from my hotel. Not to mention, it was opened bright and early, which was perfect for the jet lagged me. Toast Box is situated at the basement of The Centrepoint and one of the earliest places opened for business in the building. When I got to Toast Box with my boyfriend, there were already a few customers enjoying their breakfast and one person ahead of us. When it was our turn, we told the lady what we wanted but she asked us questions in Mandarin. Unfortunately, our Mandarin is pretty crappy but we used context clues. LOL. My boyfriend saw noodles on the menu so he tried to order that but it wasn't available. Not sure if it's not a breakfast thing or just no longer on the menu. So he got the cheese toast (came with ham and egg on top) while I got the Kaya toast. The lady asked us what drinks we would like with our meals and what type of eggs we wanted with the Kaya Toast. We went with honey tea, milk tea, and soft boiled eggs (came with 2 eggs). The seating area is small but there's more seats and tables outside of the enclosed space! The drinks, Kaya toast, and eggs were ready under 5 minutes. But the cheese w/ ham & egg toast took awhile. Understandable as there was only one lady managing the cash register and one man cooking. My kaya toast was delicious! Crusty on the outside and amazingly sweet and warm inside. The kaya (coconut jam) flavor was very subtle and blended perfectly with the slice of butter that was slightly melting from the warm toast. What surprised me even more were the soft boiled eggs. Omg. How can something so simple taste so addictingly good?! The cheese toast was just alright. Really liked the milk tea too. Comparable to Hong Kong's cha chan tang's. I saw jars of Hainanese kaya being sold by Toast Box for around $5-$6. I was really tempted to buy it but then I found kaya being sold at Cold Storage. It was a supermarket on the same floor as Toast Box. It wasn't the Toast Box brand but it was only $3 so I went with that instead lol."

I meant the restaurant located at the basement level of Sheraton Towers Singapore, not the famous Chinese poet. The cosy restaurant is popularly known for their dim sum but the other Cantonese dishes were stellar as well, which i found out after sampling some dishes from their Chinese New Year menu. Little appetizers were served and we couldn't stop snacking on the candied chestnuts with sesame seeds. The seasoned dried scallops with chili and dried shrimps had me ask for seconds (sans chili oil). I think there's some XO sauce added to it and it's certainly a good seasoning/accompaniment to the mains.Instead of the regular salmon yusheng, we had the Turbot fish, whose name in Chinese means 'many treasures'. There are fried taro and pumpkin slices in the mix, which gave the dish some added crunch.Next, the Braised Superior Bird's Nest with Crabmeat and Crab Roe. I was delighted to see that Li Bai uses birds' nest as a replacement for shark's fin. Well at least bird's nest can be sustainably farmed so it's the lesser of two evils. I liked the clean and light taste of the birds nest (Li Bai was extremely generous with the bird's nest), which was served with a copious amount of crab roe. Ask for the XO sauce, we heard from the PR girls that it's great with the soup. Next, the Lobster done two ways: Salted Egg Lobster and Sautéed fillet of lobster with greens. Surprisingly, I preferred the sautéed fillet even though anything served with salted egg is faultless. The sweetness of the crustacean could be tasted better with the ginger garlic sauce. The texture was superb as well, with the meat being springy instead of chewy. Stewed ""Eight Treasures"" Chicken with South African 5-head Abalone and Sea Cucumber is the perfect dish to be eaten with a bucket of fragrant steamed rice. Much effort has gone into the preparation of the chicken, which was first stuffed with chestnut, mushrooms, barley, lotus seed etc, then fried and browned, before stewing it for 2 hours to achieve that fall-off-the-bone quality. Abalone was briny sweet and tender too. We ended dinner with traditional Chinese desserts with a twist. This Pan-fried Nian Gao had coconut in it and was more like the Malay kueh. The Water Chestnut Cake hearts were a refreshing end to the dinner as well. Li Bai will be serving 9 reunion set menus that caters to various group sizes from 17 Jan to 24 Feb 2014. Do make a reservation in advance to prevent disappointment!Li Bai is certainly a Chinese restaurant that I will keep coming back to. Great service, environment and food. Mums will definitely love this one!"

Unfortunately after being diagnosed with kidney issues, me eating out has become a luxury and finding food that I'm able to eat has been difficult. However, we did decide to give this chicken rice place a go, with the hope that the food isn't too salty. --------------------------------------------------I love it when places exceed my expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by Roost. I happened to see Channel News Asia (of all places), feature this fairly new restaurant at Centrepoint because of the iKook, a patented machine they invented that supposedly cooks the perfect chicken rice chicken. So we figured, let's give it a shot to see how good it is. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical at first. Special machine, Chicken Rice, in the middle of town, sounds a lot like a tourist trap. However, after eating, I was left.... pretty impressed! Yin Yang Platter ($8.90) As a first timer, we had to try both their chickens and the Yin Yang Platter was the way to go. The portion was pretty decent and I have to say, I was pretty impressed by the chicken. Because of the way it's cooked, the skin remains beautiful smooth and gelatinous, Yet, giving that little crunch (or bounce?) when biting into it. The flavor is fairly light (good for someone like me who can only have very minimal salt now) but the taste of the pure chicken really shines through. It's so good that I could have done without the sauce they drizzled over. Again, do take note that I've been on a no salt / minimal salt (like 120mg max) for the last 2.5 months so my tastebuds do tend to differ from someone who regularly eats out everyday. The rice was pretty decent too, a little like Loy Kee's but less oily. Soup was, well a chicken soup, but I could taste a bit of herbal-ness in the soup, which was a nice touch. The ginger was interesting, being a little sweeter than usual and the chilli. Oh the chilli was good. It was a little sweet when you first taste it, before the sour suddenly kicks in and than the spice. Ipoh Kway Teow Soup ($7.90)This was pretty good too. The soup is light, yet very tasty and the thin Ipoh Kway Teow was cooked to perfection. The flavors were very balanced and the chilli it came with gave a real kick. A good pairing with the portion of white chicken. Chicken Sushi ($4.90)Now this was interesting. I expected the rice to be the same as the one served with chicken rice, but it wasn't! It was chicken rice + more. The addition of fries garlic and shallots, along with the oil, not only help bind the rice into sushi form, but it packed a lot of extra flavor and aroma into the rice.Topped with a very very tender piece of chicken (although I wised it was bigger), drizzled with their sauce and topped with shredded, stringy, fried ginger (that was a nice touch), the chicken sushi might sound gimmicky but it was so so so good. On a whole, I do think the chicken rice here is pretty good. It definitely ranks higher than Tian Tian in my books, and it's a good way to experience chicken rice in a comfortable, air conditioned environment, without paying a chatterbox prices. Considering that they're the new kid on the block, I really hope they survive."

Even though I do love sashimi, I decided to go with an oyako don as I hadn't had a good bowl of oyako don since my last japanese trip!1. Oyako Don $10++For $10++, I was surprised to see such a huge serving. The japanese rice was definitely quality japanese rice. You could taste the fragrance of the rice. The rice also quickly absorbed all the sauces from the omelette and the chicken making it extremely flavourful. I could totally eat a whole bowl of this rice on its own!They were extremely generous with the numerous cubs of juicy and tender chicken meat that was doused in the sweet teriyaki mixture. Served together with the don, is a miso soup which a tad too salty for my liking, but I happily fished out and ate the seaweed. Alongside, you will also get some watermelon slices.2. Ikura Chawanmushi $8++I decided to treat myself with an Ikura Chawanmushi. I love ikura and I love this even more as the Ikura was super fresh and almost melts in your mouth. The chawanmushi was steamed to perfection. It was almost like eating a pudding, a baby with no teeth would have no problem eating this. The steamed egg had a mousse-like textuyre yet withholding the characteristic notes of the egg, prawn and mushroom flavours.I'm definitely ordering this again!Overall : great quality japanese food in a cosy setting. I do hope they settle smoothly in their new location in Tanjogn Pagar and I cannot wait for my next dining experience in Kaiware.Take note : Kaiware is moving to 22 Cross Street #01-50/53 China Square Central Singapore 048423 on July 2016. Reservation contact number 6735 2345 will remain the same."

We got bunch of stuff to try, sated egg York wings, two way Chinese broccoli (half is steam and the other half was fried minced broccoli leaf...OMG, must have) and black pepper shrimp which was ok. You can get either noodles or rice with the meats. We all got noodles and the sauces/chili comes with it is pretty good.

The char siew is good. Chunky and all for the good ones. It's just that for my bowl, there were quite a few pieces with just fat and no lean meat in it. Mind you, I am not even talking about the siew-yok(roasted prok) here. I like that the bowl had some pickled cucumbers as a nice touch to warrant $9.90 but the char siew parts that I got were too fatty.Yes fat is taste but too much fat, especially in chinese cooking, equals oily equals un-stomach-able. My appetite is gone.People order char siew more for lean meat dare I might say. The fatty part could be there minimally. Dare I also might say, that fat cannot be glorified in char siew as if in a chu-toro or o-toro because those weren't as oily as char siew. So stop marketing it that way! The char siew needs to be more refined. I have tasted better in hawker centres.Talk about the roast pork, there is crispiness in it yes. But the crackle wasn't that crispy also. Dark sweet sauce could be provided for pairing. The mee pok noodles were cooked al dente, no complaints. The salted egg chicken wings got cold very quickly. The wings weren't as crispy and fresh as expected, the sauce becomes gooey quickly. A better way needs be come up with to present it other than this usual style.Thought of ordering the platter but the price of rice is $1.50! Also actually, I prefer white rice over chicken-flavoured rice for my char siew rice. That may be why I find it too oily.This place does hold so much potential. It could be a like a fook kin club of roasted delights. The sauce of the char siew is really good, but there needs to be added twist to warrant the price and make the dish more palatable.Long story short this place has got good vibes and respectable food, but it might not have enough to lure me back a second time."

After the multiple media reviews I had high hopes for this place. Alas! My hopes were dashed. While the food here isn't awful, it wasn't great either.We had the cold tofu starter and deep fried baby squid to start with. The tofu was strange with chopped century egg, some salted egg (sic?) and some ikura on top. I felt that it didn't go well altogether. The baby squid was fried to crispness and no complaints about that. This place's staple is the roast platter, and both char siew and roast pork were lacking in fat, making them a little dry. I suppose the fat proportion of a cut is highly subjective, and dependent on luck, but we didn't think highly of it. The noodles were not bad; springy. It did lack some seasoning which were easily remedied with some garlic chilli. However, it could have done with some pork lard (they should have it on all the tables). Would I return? I'm not sure."

But of course, this world's largest Tonkatsu chain do have restaurants in Tokyo, mostly in major shopping malls or department stores. To celebrate the opening of its new outlet in  313@Somerset, Saboten introduces the Iberico Loin Katsu and Fried Jumbo Prawn that are exclusive to this outlet.Iberico pork, which is famed for its refine marbling and tender texture, was not an easier cutlet to handle than the original katsu. Not as rich or oozing juices as you may find elsewhere, the trimmings were rather leathery, and some effort was required to disintegrate the protein. This in particular, is what polarizes opinions.The Fried Prawn Jumbo Set ($28.80) featuring a wild-catch Tiger prawn, crab croquette and original loin cutlet, is more likely to appease the finicky palates with a mixture of seafood and pork. The coating of breadcrumbs for this set of ingredients was also more consistently golden, light and not cloyingly oily. It would be a pity not to try the deep-fried scallops (2 for $12), especially when they are at their freshest and best condition this time of the year. The Hotate Feast is a new seasonal promotion that runs till end Oct.Good to know: there are also Grilled Chicken Set ($18) and Grilled Salmon Set ($21) for those who prefer non-fried food. Yuzu and Goma dressing are imported from Japan. The Tonkatsu Sauce is developed in-house with more than 10 types of ingredients.All the sets are complete with chawanmushi, pickles and yuzu sorbet, not forgetting the free refills of crunchy cabbage, Japan-imported rice, miso soup, that complete the teishoku experience. As usual, you proceed with the old but obligatory ritual of grinding the sesame before adding the Tonkatsu sauce. But what surprises me is that there is also radish and even curry sauces, which I view as privileges that one can't get in Japan--it is usually katsu with one and only one type of dressing. This may not be the place for the impeccable classic tonkatsu but you can still discover some reliable deep-fried gems, if you pick the right ones"

My suggestion is, if you are only dining with one other person, be sure to ask for a full table because they do have smaller tables along the wall. But, those tables are packed in there pretty tight. From this, you won't really be able to enjoy your conversation and your meal as you may very well have somebody you don't know sitting right next to you. And, I mean right next to you. This restaurant also offers live acoustic music on various nights of the week. The performers all seem to be pretty good and what they provide is covers of some well-known tunes.

So when I asked for a new beer because a fly had landed in it they brought me a partially poorer beer that was missing the orange. So I asked if I could get another orange slice like my last beer. Unfortunately this restaurant has a fly problem cause another fly landed in my second beer. They brought me a new beer and this time they told me this would be the last beer. To that I said yes please and remove this beer as it's not my problem you have flys in your restaurant. To this they said it wasn't their problem either? This seems odd to me as I'm used to if restaurants have a bug or rodent problem they actually do need to take some kind of action to correct it. You'll never guess next they explain that they had sat us at a six person table and because a party of six has shown up they would like to move us to the hall way seating.

This is one of those situations where you think, ""I get what you're trying to do, but how do I say this nicely? No.""I get that this is a trendy place; their dark and sexy interior communicates this well. We arrived on a weekday evening, and most of the tables inside were already reserved. We ended up sitting outside, which wasn't bad as they still made efforts to decorate this area and create an ambiance. The food sounded promising, and there was a lot to choose from. I almost want to say that they're a little confused, as their signboard mentions modern Italian/pizzeria even though there is page after page of Asian inspired tapas and dishes.We ordered a Caprese salad and their Morning After Pizza, which includes a fried egg in the middle. The Caprese salad was amazing. All the ingredients were fresh, and I still remember the beautiful texture and saltiness of the proscuitto. Unfortunately, the Morning After Pizza fell very flat. We couldn't taste anything, which was surprising considering all the toppings that were on there- the roasted mushrooms, the egg, the minced parsley, the melted cheese. Maybe it was the tomato sauce- perhaps it needed more salt? For a place that has ""pizzeria"" on their signboard, this concerns me greatly. I leave my review at 3 stars because they have the ambiance down, and it seems like a great spot for tea or some snacks. I wouldn't say I'd avoid this place completely, but for pizza in this type of setting and for those prices, you'll find me at Extra Virgin instead."

A pretty face. No substance, no umpty-ump.Back to the review, on the surface, Supply & Demand has really got it going on. Beautiful interior, great atmosphere, good looking people, modern ambience. We started off with the Caprese Salad and it was sublime. The tomato, Caprese and rocket, I mean arugula... doused with olive oil is a must have.  Our second dish was the Morning After Pizza. A tomato based mushroom, bacon pizza topped with soft egg. It tasted like Card Board. Ok that's harsh, but really with all those toppings lumped together, how could it be that bad... We may have gotten a bad batch, but it's as if the pizza was pre-cooked, refrigerated, heated and then served. The soft egg was not even center, so the lucky person who got that slice was the only one who had a chance to taste it.In short, Supply & Demand is my Adriana Lima.

Of course there was plenty of vegetarian fare to be found in Little India.. but if I wanted Indian food all week I would have just gone to India.That being said, there was not a huge selection of vegetarian items at Supply and Demand but the kitchen was very accommodating towards our needs and modified pastas and pizzas on the menu accordingly. We really appreciated that the kitchen was willing to add in extra veggies as needed instead of subtracting the meat yet still charging $22 for some tomato sauce and mozz.I LOVED the decor at Supply and Demand! The space imbues an industrial aesthetic in the form of concrete floors, reclaimed wood tables, and exposed ceiling beams and pipes. The dim lighting completed the urban feel of this trendy eatery. It seems to be a pretty popular place as we had to wait about an hour to be seated (at 8 pm) and as we dined there seemed to be an endless flow of patrons. The crowd was predominantly people in their late 20s-30s sans children; I'd assume this means the late night scene at the rooftop bar is pretty fun.Overall, a very pleasant experience and I definitely recommend Supply and Demand to any vegetarians seeking a meal with Western hemisphere flavors!"

Don't get me wrong. It is not entirely quiet (as in no customer) kinda quiet but it's the certain ""zen"" that it exudes the minute I stepped in to this restaurant. First off -  no queue. And second - price is reasonable. And third - good food. Go straight to the superstar when you order - Pork Gyoza either panfried or boil, depending what you fancy. If you want something other than pork, the Prawn gyoza is a good choice too. Besides gyoza, the waitress would recommend you an in house special called jia jia men, a noodle dish which is pretty similiar with the taiwanese version (jia xiang mien). I dont like it as i felt it lacked of taste but found myself ordering my last two recent visits. (i have no hope, i know). Upon serving you jiajia men, the waitress will tell you to mix everything in the bowl and once you're done eating half portion of the noodle, she will then add in ""hot soup"" to it and a half boiled egg into the soup. So for the price of one, you get to enjoy the dry version and then the soup version. Selling at $6.50 per portion, I thought it's a pretty good deal. If you;re still not full, the garlic fried rice and the Nikujyaga (braised beef in stock, i think) are pretty decent. I would def come back from time to time."

I am usually not a fan of gyoza as it is usually sticky, mushy or has a thick layer of dough.I am pretty much blown away with the gyoza here. The dumpling is nicely crisped on one side. The skin is very thin so you do have to deal with chewing through to reach the filling. I had the pork gyoza so the meat was moist and very juicy. Dip it into the sauce and topped with ginger and you have a winner. There are 3 types of fillings now - pork, vegetables and prawns.I also tried the jyajya  men. I was curious about it as there was an instruction sheet on each table on how to enjoy it to its maximum. It was basically chewy noodles with miso paste, minced meat and green onions. Add vinegar and chili oil (or chili flakes) to taste. I found that to be a bit on the bland side, maybe I did not add enough  seasoning. Halfway through the noodles, you could add the soft boiled egg (the server would bring it over when you tell them you wish to have the egg), more miso paste and a bit of the noodle water to have a soupy eggy noodle. This was much better as the additional miso paste did give more taste to the noodle. The highlight is still the gyoza. Order a plate or three. It is that good. The pan-fried version that is."

The skin was thin and crispy and the filling tasty and balanced. I also had the boiled crab gyoza and while they were really nice, I still preferred the fried pork ones but this might just be personal preference.A nice plus is their condiments: they have a range of condiments (including sliced ginger - my fave)  on the table so you can mix your own dipping sauce (in my case: heaps and heaps of ginger with black vinegar and a dash of chili oil).

Having opened at the old Heeren since last year, it has introduced new items to meet the ever-changing consumers' tastebuds. One of my favourites picks was the all-new Crab Gyoza $7.80, an interesting and flavourful twist to the traditional meat filling. Made with fresh crab instead of frozen crab meat, each dumpling is wrapped with the exact same amount of filling, churned and measured to perfection by the machine.The other new dish is the Tonkatsu Udon ($6.80). The creamy broth tasted like Ban Mian Soup--light but no less oily than a Tonkotsu ramen. The ""udon"" belongs to the flatter Kishimen Udon that is popular in Iwate prefecture. It resembles Ban Mian, but softer in texture.Pan fried food tends to win over steamed or boiled ones because they have the extra fragrant burnt aroma. But hey, the Boiled Pork Gyozas($4.80) are not too bad either. Succulent and well-seasoned, the skin is just slightly thicker thus chewier than Xiao Long Bao. I thought the chefs were pretty clever to drizzle them in sweet miso sauce. Too much meat? There is always the Vegetable Pan Fried Gyozas($4.80), just as freshly made like their gyoza siblings.  If you like unfiltered sake, this is one of the places in Singapore that actually imports this premium brew from Japan.Gyoza-ya also prides itself as being the first to serve this Jya Jya Men($6.50) in Singapore. Not to be confused with the typical Chinese or Korean bean paste noodles, Jya Jya Men is an Iwate prefecture delicacy that ranks together with Wanko Soba and Rei Men (Cold Noodles) as Morioka's Top three Noodles.What's the difference? The noodles and the way of eating. Either Kishimen aka flat udon (same as the Tonkatsu Udon) or the usual thick udon, are topped with Minced Meat Miso & Cucumber and eaten with chilli oil and vinegar. After emptying the noodles, the staff will add a soft-boiled egg, more miso minced meat and some boiling water that was used to cooked the udon. Stir everything and you'll get this greyish broth. Doesn't taste as rich as it looks but neither is it as slurpy as ramen broth. I loved the Yaki Azuki Gyoza out of all and felt that it needn't be eaten as desserts towards the end of the meal. Sweet red bean mash encased in thin, crisp shell that reminded me of my all-time love, the Croissant Taiyaki. Never mind if there isn't any butter since they're probably healthier. Matcha, Sesame and Yuzu Ice Cream ($6 each) imported from Hokkaido are also wonderful sweet endings, though the red beans were undercooked. The biggest draw factor is the price. With the gyozas at an average $4.80 for 5 pieces and other food not exceeding $7, it's possibly one of the best deals for Japanese food in Orchard."

I tried to make myself available but every time I'm ready, something caught up. It's kinda sad when I am away from home most of the time with very brief period each time when I return from abroad. But I know I can't find excuse not to visit this time in Jan when I schedule my unplanned return to SG. I have been eating dumplings in Australia and they were mostly made by the mainland Chinese who flock the country of late. But I wasn't expecting the same at Gyoza-Ya, simply that I have read reviews from reputable accolades and I know they are one of my trusted source. I reached the humble outlet prior the dinner crowd: the time reads 6.15pm. There's ample tables to go around for 4s but 2s were almost taken up. The wait staff was polite and obliging to give me a table near the corner of the restaurant when I turned down his offer on the small table next to the entrance, neither a bar counter seat is welcoming, I told myself. I was given a small slip of order list that spells what the restaurant offers. Quite extensive given the size of the humble eating place. The service was very prompt and attentive. My Yuzu Cha arrived quickly and order was taken attentively. I was such a glutton that I ticked so many dishes that they seems to battle for table space when they arrived.  The soup udon was so flavorful that I can't bear to let them drained any unconsumed broth into the sink! The thick slab of char siew was equally good!! Tender and very well marinated, a good layer of lean plus fats goes so well. The JyaJya Men on the contrary didn't fare that well, perhaps the miso wasn't as robust. On average, the udon has a good chewy texture but still, I prefer the round udon to flat udon, the latter has a tougher bite. Gyoza-Ya serves only flat udon. Red king crab dumplings are a must eat. At $7.50, I got 5 plump gyoza filled with juicy minced crab meat, it's a premium dish in affordable price I must say. I like my dumplings boiled every time I had gyoza, even when I had them abroad. The pan fried pork dumplings were excellent too! Not greasy and there's a faint sweetness from the chopped cabbage mixed in the minced pork. The fried soft bone chicken chunks was crisp and addictive. I like the fried batter coating, it taste like the prized crunchy batter bits from long john silver fast food chain! Salty but a delightful way! It's a hate it or love it dish if u don't mind eating soft cartilage. What I least like was the tofu topped with minced beef, the seasoning in the beef just taste weird which I find no words in describing. I'm sorry. But the tofu has a silky texture. I'm glad to have made the trip tonight. Now, I can strike one restaurant out of my to-eat list that goes on and on whenever I leave my home base. Gyoza-Ya, indeed an inexpensive dumpling house that every foodies should at least try once. YUM!!"

The noodles were smooth and delicate but slightly bland even with the goma sauce. I suppose the point was to appreciate the texture of the noodles. Meanwhile the teriyaki chicken was a little too sweet and sour, and didn't really taste like teriyaki at all. Indeed it was kind of like shredded jerky.Gyoza is what this place specialises in. The gyoza were bigger than at other places and the skin was smooth and not overly-thick like at some places. However the gyoza were not sealed so the meatballs inside fell out sometimes. Also the taste of the pork inside was a little odd. The gyoza sauce here seems to be a mix of, among other things, soy sauce, vinegar, oil and sugar. This compares to vinegar at many other places.We also had 2 types of noodles: jyajya men and tonkotsu udon. Jyajya men is like the Japanese version of Chinese zhajiang mian - noodles with a black meat sauce on top. Unfortunately these noodles were rather bland - more sauce was needed, and the sauce wasn't all that fragrant in the first place. It got even worse when, as recommended, I cracked in a soft boiled egg, added some sauce and hot water - it was even more bland. The tonkotsu udon was much better, being served in a rich meat broth.We also had seafood fried rice since the portions were quite small. It wasn't bad as far as Japanese fried rice goes (I think because they fry it on a grill instead of a wok it doesn't have much wok hei [smokiness of the wok] that Chinese fried rice has), but there was hardly any seafood inside. And yes, the portion was small to.The individual dishes are cheap but they add up to more than you'd expect! With two cups of green tea it added up to $40.60."

OMG, Gyoza-ya, where have thou been all my life?The Yaki Buta Gyoza, aka the pan-fried pork Gyoza, is a MUST must must order. I already had high expectation from all the rave reviews on yelp, but I was not disappointed. The thinness of the gyoza skin, the perfect sear, the delicious minced pork that went so well with the vinegar sauce - just blew my mind. It's the absolute star of this restaurant. In fact, next time I wouldn't bother ordering anything else and just order multiple servings of this.It's 5 pieces per serving by the way. I think i can easy eat 20 of these by myself.However since I had to meet the $25 delivery order limit, I ordered other stuff too. Namely:Sui Buta Gyoza (boiled pork dumpling) - meh. Maybe bc it was delivered, i find that the thinness of the gyoza skin, which is what made the pan fried version so amazing, does not transfer over to the boiled version. Also not a fan of the sweet sauce that they douse all over it. I may have liked it more without the sauce.The garlic egg fried rice - this was much talked about on yelp so I gave it a try. And... I mean, it's good, but just like garlic fried rice in other japanese places.Broccoli aburi - meh. This was a weird deep fried(?) broccoli with bonito(?) flakes on top. Not really a fan.Ramen egg - i only needed another $2 to get to $25 so I threw this in. It was a good ramen egg, but it's what you should expect in other japanese places as well."

The chicken rendang is definitely one of the better ones around as the chicken is still moist and not hard and dry. I do like the decor with its posters of Marilyn Monroe and other famous stars of the yesteryear.

What I remember to be the most outstanding is the beef rendang, with a perfect balance of spices forming an amazingly fragrant dish. Other recommended dishes include sayur lodeh, tauhu telor, and tapioca plant. For the brave-hearted, you can try the ox tongue, which has an acquired taste and texture and definitely does not appeal to everyone. Those with a low tolerance for hot and fiery fare will be up for a challenge, seeing that they are that generous with their spices. However, just eat the dishes with the generous portion of steam rice served and there should not be a problem."

There is only one thing I liked here, ie service. One word summed up the whole experience: meh!FOOD 3/5Despite the layout to give an impression the range of food was extremely extensive, the food was mediocre at best. Nothing really stood up, nothing to rave about. It was disturbingly mediocre for the price and venue of this lunch buffet. To me, they are just lousy calories I was consuming. AMBIENCE 2/5The tables and chairs were arranged so close to each other. It was like a dining hall in a college but those tables and chairs in my college were not even that close. It was a pain to walk between chairs at different tables. And mind you I am not even that broad. I had to be careful not to bump onto any chairs on both my sides. Also, I find some of the patrons Triple Three attracted were .. how should I put it nicely? Hmmm.. ok there is no way but to be blatantly honest here, the word is ""selfish"". I witnessed some patrons would took all the pan fried salmon after the chef cooked a batch of them and placed in the tray.  Clearly there was a line behind. These people were those who would go to any buffet and displayed their lack of etiquette and wanted to make sure their consumption was worth every penny they spent. SERVICE 5/5The staff who took care of our table was really friendly and attentive. She would clear our plates promptly and refilled our water. Moving forward, I would not even eat here for free. Even a top notch service would not move me. It is such a pity. Sorry, but not really.Triple Three = 3 3 3 = 9/3 = 3 Stars :PA little update: My brother just told me what was the cost per pax for lunch buffet at Triple 3, almost S$100 including tax per person!!

The food was okay, but it was hard to get food. Instead of laying things out, Triple 3 prefers to have their staff serve you, so that creates lines all over the place. For instance, they cut your sashimi to order, so that takes a little longer. Or the snake of people in line for naan, which blocks off most of the indian food area. The pasta station only had one burner, so it was also a wait for pasta. There was also a line at the tempura station, and the tepanyaki station. I have never been to a buffet that required so much waiting in line. I think this is a big issue, and I won't be back because of it. The lines die down towards the second half of the meal service, but that means I have less time to eat.In terms of quality of food, the salmon sashimi was okay, but the swordfish was very watery. The tempura was well done, light and crispy. The pasta was okay. The meats were not very flavorful. Despite being offered a variety of food, I found my plate constantly filled with the same items, usually items that don't require me standing in line. There was a one-for-one special if you use a POSB/DBS card, so we took that offer. They actually didn't bother to verify that we had the card before giving us the bill. I think the buffet was meant to be cheaper...please don't ever pay the full price for this. For $78++, you can do a lot better."

My favourite, however, is the outstanding tempura live station where the batter is as good as it gets. I hardly finished sampling the entire spread given over 8 counters to choose from, every culinary station hardly disappointed. the roast and indian are highlights done rather well at a buffet where I would have expected less given the quantity. But here there's no compromise on quality too. If you love seafood like I do, the crab legs and succulent prawns, are juicy and sweet with a fresh ocean savouriness rather than a stale fishy taste that I've had at other buffets.Kudos to a great buffet spot,  but it's always packed, so do book early!"

It may only be cabbage, but the freshness, crispness and sweetness of the cabbage helps cut down the oil in the Tonkatsu, making it easier to finish. The soup that comes with it is perfect as well. These aren't simple bowls of pre-mixed miso soup as well. Made with carrots, Radish (daikon) and pieces of pork, these little bowl of soups are stars of their own, helping ensure the sweetness of the cabbage and its sesame sauce, doesn't over power the pork loin, allowing its umami-ness to shine through. To ensure that we don't over eat or overload ourselves, we tend to order a Jumbo Ruso set with an additional rice set ($4.00) to share, which is more than enough for us. Overall, we really love the restaurant and really can't find any fault with it. Simply love the Tonkatsu here and still our go to place whenever we have the craving for it!"

The place is nice, good sevice and quite similar to a Tonkatsu-ya in Japan, food is not exactly cheap.I loved the miso, tsukemono, brown rice choice and all the sauces. Shame for the main thing, which is the tonkatsu, it wasn't all that great, quite dry despite me ordering the Kurobuta Hire which is meant to be the best pork that they have on offer.ALl in all I have had better, but it's a decent option if you are in the area and really want to eat Tonkatsu."

Can't say I'd eat here often or even come back again, but I felt pretty satisfied after polishing off my set meal. The restaurant was half empty(full) when we walked in around at almost 9pm on a Friday evening. They had a ""MisoKatsu Fair"" special at the time: sizzling negi miso rosu katsu set (pork loin with negi miso sauce and egg) for ~S$24++. Pork fillet went for a dollar more. FYI pork fillet is also known as tenderloin and is the leanest of all cuts, so it's a healthier choice. My friend got the pork fillet, and it was less flavorful in my opinion. The chefs cook the meat in a open kitchen right in front of the bar, so you can see the marbling of the meat before they fry it up. To be honest, I expected the pork to be cooked with a bit more skill or technique. Although the meat was very high quality, the end result was just like another fried piece of meat. The sizzling platter was a nice touch as it kept the food warm, but it wasn't a testament to the cooking. The side dishes were nice, but nothing spectacular or unique.After adding on a chocolate cake dessert (just for good measure), the damage came up to about S$35. Glad I tried it, but not willing to pay this much again for some fried pork cutlet."

They give you a scoop of rice, japanese cabbage salad both with unlimited serving and a small bowl of miso soup. I get that they serve many types of pork but the quality just isn't there. I have had much better tonkatsu elsewhere. I was really disappointed with my dish. Since you can't go wrong with rice and cabbage, my grief is with the other items on the plate. I had the mangalica rosu katsu and guess what, the meat was stale, not crispy, not tasty, and jerky. Other people who think this place has the best tonkatsu either they haven't had real good ones or I was just unlucky to be facing a gruesome experience here. It's really a nightmare for me. The cashier was nice though. On the side note, you may want to put the sauce on the side, because your tonkatsu might get soggy by the end."

I loved it. Well, I also haven't been to Tonkichi in a really long time and that used to be my go-to place for gd tonkatsu, but my bro said this place won over Tonkichi when he went on a tonkatsu hunt with his gf. Anyway, I don't like very fatty cuts of meat, so I went for hire-katsu and it was deliciously juicy! As other reviewers have mentioned, the tonkatsu tasted really light and not soaked in oil as is typical of not-so-good places. It was amazing and made me very happy. I got the 120g portion, which actually didn't look like very much but was pretty filling. $22.80++The tonjiru soup, pickles, and cabbage are all free flow. Soup was delicious! And had a ton of ingredients.. Very comforting and brothy and hearty. Cabbage dressing was also very good, went well with cabbage. OH, big plus for being able to get brown rice! I LOVE brown rice. and at no extra charge. Makes me even happier :)Only thing is that I like Tonkichi's actual sesame seed grinder (sort of like mortar and pestle) as opposed to Ma Maison's plastic container thing that effectively does the same thing. Oh! But Ma Maison had both spicy and sweet tonkatsu sauce, never had the spicy one before. Pretty interesting. Liked both of them!Orange jelly that came after the meal was really strange and artificial tasting though, skip that.. Service was okay, took a while to get anyone's attention, I suppose things were getting busy on a Thursday night. It took a while for them to give us warm water and I had to keep asking for more though."

Ok, take this as you will, I'm from nyc and obviously not from Japan, so my opinion might be a bit skewed, but still very much honest. I have had tonkatsu many times in nyc/nj but at ma maison, it was the best I've ever had. The service was great, super friendly and very helpful. It's hard to find good service like that here so it was really refreshing to see that again since I left America. The miso beer and sweet potato sochu...awesome! My boyfriend ordered the black pig tonkatsu and he wasn't impressed. The meat was tough, and I'm not sure if its because it might have been a little overlooked or maybe that's just how the texture is naturally. I actually enjoyed his dish. Yes, it was a bit tough and chewy, but it was still juicy and flavorful. I had the tonkatsu fillet and, again, the bomb! That dark sauce is salty and flavorful, plus the nice shredded PILE of cabbage. The sticky brown rice was also fantastic. It was nutty and hearty, just awesome. I want to find out how to make that, because I can get used to that kind of brown rice! Not cheap though. 2 drinks and 2 meals was $100. Thank god the food was good."

When my craving for katsudon hit me last week, I made the rare special trip to orchard on a weekday to have some katsudon and was sorely disappointed. I'll cut to the chase. The service was appalling. I understand being rushed and busy. I was perfectly happy to wait. However, I do not appreciate being shooed out of the restaurant and made to feel like it was my fault while the manager, I think, scolded the waitress for almost sitting us before another couple that we (and apparently the waitress) hadn't realised was waiting. Embarrassed, we walked out and endured the glares from that couple although all we had done was said 'table for two?' When we were seated, the appetiser came in a very rushed rambling of the description as though he didn't have time for us or this at all. We then proceeded to wait eons for the food until, after realising we kept looking over, the manager finally came over and said 'There's some quality issues with the white rice. We are cooking a new batch now. I think you should change to the brown rice.' When told that 'no, we would prefer to wait for the white rice, thanks', he kept trying to convince us to change our minds before, defeated, he went to the kitchen to check how long it would take. Incredibly, two seconds later, we were told that they weren't sure the second batch wouldn't have the same quality issue (in the white rice? Really?) and we should take the brown rice. 'Should' was being used in a 'you should take it or you have no rice' sort of way. At this, we had no choice but to agree to the brown rice. At this point, I'd like to say that I have nothing against brown rice, but my partner really did not want brown rice and was willing to wait for the white rice anyway.The katsudon did arrive with very little rice drowned in the sauce. It definitely wasn't a good katsudon sauce either and the lack of rice made for a too salty too sweet katsudon. Perhaps they were running out of brown rice, seeing as there isn't any white rice apparently. There wasn't an apology though he did appear at the end of the meal and asked 'did you like the food'. We just smiled, as we didn't want to deal with him anymore, but it was an awfully disappointing experience. In fact, I was still thinking about that satisfying katsudon I never had the next day, and went to Ginza bairin for dinner promptly. I wouldn't recommend people not to go for the tonkatsu, but just a word of caution about the service. Also, I've heard the service at the Bugis branch is much better anyway. For that price and quality though, I'd just go for the cheaper Ginza Bairin's chicken katsudon set. It's much much more gratifying."

Having never patronised T before, it was a clear winner on the freshness list, and we were warmly greeted by chirpy servers. We were quickly served balls of chilled, grated radish and a detailed look through the menu saw us ordering up Mameton, their self proclaimed bestseller, an Iberico pork set, and an Ebikatsu set. All orders come with a side of rice (plain or multi grain), pickles and soup.Taste wise: wow. It's a clear difference between pedestrian pork, dished out in the Mameton set, and Iberican pork. The breaded crust (panko?) was delightful to bite into, and not cloyingly oily as katsus are wont to be. The Iberico was well marbled, I.e. fatty, which provided a juicy burst or meaty goodness with each bite. It's not to say that the regular version was shoddy, but it just paled so much in comparison when side by side with the Spanish cut. The ebikatsu wasn't too bad, though strangely I adored the side of finely shredded cabbage. Icy cold, the servers would come around offering extra servings of fibre, which went very well when liberally doused with the accompanying sesame dressing. In addition, the meals come with roasted tea and a small cube of jelly as dessert. The flavours seem to vary daily, and ours was peach - cold, clean tasting, and not overly sweet. Price wise, three sets came up to shy of $100, though it also has to do with going for the premium pork. I do enjoy the service though, we're hard pressed to find sincere and friendly waitstaff around here. And the fact that it consists of cute Japanese blokes makes it so much more of a rarity!"

Wow, pretty impressive.Good morning Nanyang is small and convenient, right by the Chinatown station. I got a honey lemon drink, while my mom got a complicated version of coffee. Quick service on a weekday afternoon. There's also a buzzer to let us know when our food is ready. I had traditional toast, good but nothing special. Orange ciabatta with butter was surprisingly tasty! A little sweetness, but not too much. Nicely toasted and not too much butter. Love it!My honey lemon drink was nicely done. Not too sweet but not too bland. My mom also really enjoyed her coffee, and has been frequenting this location for awhile. I wouldn't make a special trip to visit, but if I was by chinatown and was looking for a short break or snack, I will definitely stop by. P.S. there is free wifi if you need some!"

The coffee was nice but it was not sweet. Perfect for those who always order their drinks as ""siu dai"" (less sweet) as this is their normal. I requested for more sweetness and it was still not as sweet as the drinks you get at Ya Kun or Killiney or Toastbox. The rice which came with the chicken curry was very hard. It looked like it was scraped from the bottom of the rice cooker. Either that or it was old rice. Being a Monday I would not be surprised if they actually served leftover rice. The chicken curry was good, thick rich spicy gravy with potato and 3 pieces of chicken (2 mini drumlets and a mid-wing). It got noisy when packed and you could hardly hear yourself think. There was nothing to absorb the noise. I would be interested to try the other food as they do have different types of bread for toast."

A tad more expensive than the rest but the bread alone already costs SGD$3.00 (promo price). The highlight was the black charcoal bread. A good amount of sunflower seeds on the bread.

We tried to make reservations for 6 on a Sunday afternoon but they were running a full house so we had to settle for the 8 pm slot. Service was brisk as the place was bustling with activity. My favorite dish here is their signature Crab Beehoon 龍記米粉蟹. The thin strands of rice vermicelli had absorbed the rich flavours of the crab jus and brown sauce. The crab was perfectly cooked and delectably succulent. Don't forget to order this dish when you visit. The Har Cheong Gai 虾酱鸡翅 (Deep-Fried Chicken Wings marinated in Shrimp Paste) is another dish worth splurging your calorie intake on. I loved the crispy skin and juicy meat.If you have a weakness for Salted Egg Yolk (like moi), definitely order the Pan fried Salted Egg Pork Rib 咸蛋排骨. The grainy texture and the umami-rich savoury flavour of the Salted Egg Yolk coating around the browned pork ribs adds another level of enjoyment to the juicy meat.

Possibly even better than when the chef-owner was toiling in the kitchens at the now-defunct Golden Spoon Seafood (it was ""that other restaurant"" across the carpark from Por Kee).We had:1) Long Ji Crab Bee Hoon ($): a towering mound of bee hoon drenched in broth with a crab sitting pretty atop, looks impressive but pedestrian in taste. A little disappointing, after all that hype. The lard-tinged broth was sweet but lacked depth, and needed a little spice or piquancy to kick it up several notches. I had to ask for copious lashings of fried garlic crisps, and sambal,for oomph.2) Fermented Pork Belly ($15 for small): another signature dish but wow did it deliver. The bite-sized strips of pork were scrumptious- flavoursome, and juicy. Elevated by that awesome sambal that was at once punchy and lively. I'll return just for these.3) Cereal Pumpkin Beancurd ($18 for small): also lackluster. It was creamy and sweet enough, but one-dimensional in flavour, and missing in that well-rounded savoury component."

Despite us asking our server twice about the status of our pies, and the server both times confirming that they're on their way, an hour passes before we get fed up and ask for the manager.Another server comes over, we calmly explain the situation, and say that if the pizzas are indeed on their way, we should have them comped as we've waited way too long. By the look on her face, I knew she didn't want to do that. So then she goes on to say there isn't a manager on duty, and that she can relay our concerns when he comes back.... tomorrow. Or give him a call. Yup. I will let you come to your own conclusions about that.We continued to push, saying that we'll just cancel it and head out. But she insists that the pizza is already done and that cancelling it is not possible. This goes on for a while, until she finally checks with the kitchen. She comes back, acknowledges there was an operational error, then FINALLY decides to give us the pizza for free.To add insult to injury, we asked for the check as I wolfed down the 2000 and late pizza, only for them to take an additional 20 minutes to run our credit cards and close out our tab.I'm pretty sure that this place has been around for a while, so I wouldn't necessarily say this service lapse is a teething problem.

Only bee hoon is used, no other way about it. It's Hakka style, so you get three kinds of ingredients - fish balls, fish paste wrapped in bean curd skin, and tofu - and the chilli and sweet sauce dip goes with the ingredients nicely. There's an undeniably homely feel to a piping hot bowl of flavorful, soupy bee hoon with some soy beans nestled at the bottom in the middle of the day. Granted, you'd be drenched in sweat after the lunch hour, but resistance is futile. Come early as some of the items get sold out sooner than others.

Some were a bit hard and others not bad.Ribs were only so so. Meat not so tender even though we asked for softer meat.

It is the closest to what I am use to from back home - clearer soup, peppery and stronger herb taste. Located opposite the Tiong Bahru market, there is usually a fair amount of people but I never had an issue locating a seat. I usually go for the big ribs, pork kidney and noodles - all good. Not the cheapest around. That combi that I usually order, with a drink, would cost about $20 for one person. Of course there are other stuff on the menu and with everywhere else, it very much depends on what you order.Service is good. Staff usually busy busy but attentive."

This style of soup is best if you like to drink heaps of it, as it isn't overly peppery and tastes more like the natural sweetness of pork. I confess I had three bowls of it - free flow right?Perhaps considered a slightly unique preference, I like to eat BKT with innards. They serve a mix of innards here - liver, kidney, and a some large intestines. They serve the innards BKT with the liver slightly undercooked so it bleeds into the soup. If you do eat innards, but dislike them bloody, make sure you tell them about it, or wait a while before tucking into your food.As usual for BKT, you eat them with fried dough crullers (you tiao) soaked in soup, ad salted vegetables, black sauce, and soup with rice. YUM! Come here for a casual meal with your friends, and prepare to sweat. Enjoy!"

I'm no bak kut teh expert, nor am I very particular about the bak kut teh I eat, so my indifference has always equated to an a-ok meal here. :) To be honest, I've never actually ordered here, as I've always depended on my colleagues who speak Chinese. If you know Chinese, I think it definitely makes the ordering process a lot easier.I'm always a bit embarrassed eating bak kut teh with someone other than my husband because I am an ANIMAL when it comes to eating pork ribs. I am amazed at how deft my colleagues are when they eat pork ribs with chopsticks.* I, on the other hand, have no choice but to get my hands dirty! Thank goodness they give us those wet napkins!Overall, this is an affordable place that keeps the traditional outdoor eating scene alive in super trendy Tiong Bahru.*If anyone from work is reading this, you can't say I never said anything nice about y'all!"

I suppose Bak Kut Teh is to me what chicken rice is to most other people.Now, the Bak Kut Teh here isn't really the peppery sort, nor is it the herbal sort. WHAT SORT COULD IT BE THEN you ask?It's... the sweet sort. Ostensibly peppery, the pepper here is so mild that you actually get the natural sweetness of the pork coming through. For those of you who've had various Chinese-style pork soups (like, pig stomach soup for example), you'll know the sweetness I'm talking about.That's not bad mind you, some people like the milder, sweeter flavour of the soup.But it's not for me. I like my Bak Kut Teh peppery, with a zing. The other dishes are a-okay too, since it's unlikely you'll turn up just to order BKT.Peanuts, salted veg, youtiao, they're all done decently. The star here though is always going to be the soup, and the 'dragon ribs'."

This establishment serves up the white peppery kind, and there are two types of ribs available, the regular and the dragon rib but we usually go for the former option. Add to that a side of of stewed salted veggies and plain white rice, and you're good to roll. The soup is not always consistent - sometimes they are heavy handed on the pepper, and other times it can lean more onto the sweet side. The pork is tender with sufficient give at each chew, and the salted veggies and gravy are complement the rice nicely. Humble fare with homely food - while it's not knock your socks off awesome, it makes a great option for a simple lunch. The coffee shop does get very crowded, which only serves to attest to its popularity."

If you want truly spicy Sichuan food this is the place to go. Unassuming little place on Outram road but what fabulous food. I had the chong Qing chicken (thinly sliced garlic, peppercorns, red chilly, ginger, fried chicken). It will burn you through and through so make sure you have rice on the side to absorb the heat. I also had the dumplings in chili oil. Also spicy but in a more straightforward way. The chicken teases you mercilessly with heat and numbness. The pieces are small and crunchy with no real bones."
