It started with the preserved duck egg which I would actually recommend (just don't ask for a full description until after you eat it!). For the entree we had chicken rice which was awesome. I definitely recommend this for a local meal. We also had the green dragon vegetables (delicious!) and a tofu soup that was awesome. The overall restaurant was very nice and clean and clearly it's a place that locals frequent. I would definitely recommend for a sit down meal and good local flavors.

Boon Tong Kee is often regarded as one of local favorite spots where families and friends gather for good times over delicious Cantonese home-style food. Many regulars come to Boon Tong Kee primarily for their Signature Boiled Chicken or Famous Chicken Rice, also known for its silky white sauce chicken rice. Although chicken is the signature dish here, there is a wide selection of irresistible creations you wouldn't want to miss out. Some of the notable mentions such as Fried Bean Sprouts with Salted Fish, Fried Assorted Vegetables (Kang Kong) with Sambal, Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Eggs and Crispy Deep Fried Chicken are quite popular. The options are simply too many to list... if you have the appetite and the belly, I'd say explore and try as much as you can indulge."

Went thru the menu but It took a full 8 mins before our order was taken. The restaurant was not that full. A couple who came after us was served before us. My wife wanted to walk out, but as good people, we waited. Finally the chicken dish arrived and we tucked in to succulent meal.

The other stuff they try to push on you is passable but just stick with the chicken rice and all will be well. Came here on the second day of CNY and the line was insane with over an hour wait. We had heard the claypot rice here was quite popular and thus we ordered ahead while waiting for our table so the timing synced up. Alas, the claypot rice is alright but very forgettable. But the dependable staples didn't disappoint. Love the fragrant savory rice here. I can eat bowls of it! Paired with the silken white skin and moist chicken, it just works. Another staple, that fried tofu. Impeccable delicate and soft on the inside with a light crispy exterior. I don't know how it holds its texture but when dipped in the salad dressing, so yummy! Oh and that char siew that's already on your table when you're seated... it's just sublime. Being CNY, we also ordered lo hei for some festive cheer and our server was really personable in preparing it. But for everyday classics that won't disappoint, the chicken rice, fried tofu, and char siew are winners for sure. Also this location is open late which is a plus for supper cravings."

The restaurant is clean and the staff have the usual stiff upper lip until you warm them up with some ""xie xie's"" and attempting to banter with them. We of course ordered a plate of HC which come with individual bowls of rice (hells yeh). The chicken never fails, especially when you top it off with ginger, sweet soy and chilli. We also ordered a range of dishes from fried tofu (hells yes), baby spinach with salted and century egg, a Cantonese fave, broccoli and mushrooms, ""gourmet"" fried spring rolls and the seafood horfun. Special shout outs to the tofu which was light with the perfect amount of salty coating and the horfun. Sweet baby J, the horfun was to die for. The sheets themselves were the fattest I've seen. The seafood fresh. The sauce, solid. I was so full but kept going back for more. Downside: A LOT of MSG. MSG is killing my food vibe in Singapore.

Flaky , moist and just seasoned right. The sauce didnt overpower and just the right amount. It was delish.

After declining, I asked for iced water and instead got some weird coconut drink. If you can't even understand the word ""water"" that's definitely a problem. She did manage to get the rest of our order correct, probably because I pointed on the menu.Despite this, my dad truly enjoyed it, and our bill was under $20.

Unfortunately, it's a little far for me to constantly visit them but they are still one of my favorite chicken rice restaurants to visit when I have the craving. With all the chicken rice stalls and restaurants popping up, with one receiving a Bib Gourmand from Singapore's Michelin guide, what differentiates Loy Kee from the rest of the pack?Why it is still my Go To place for chicken rice. Firstly, the rice. Unlike most places that tend to offer healthier options these days, Loy Kee doesn't. Is it sinful? YES! But it's also bursting with flavour and nothing makes me happier than having oily lips with every mouthful of rice (best time to kiss a loved one). The Chicken. What's popular now is boneless chicken rice, where they skillfully remove all the bones, either from the breast or thighs and serve it beautifully presented on a plate. I, on the other hand, love picking meat of the bones as that's where all the flavours are. Despite being a huge boiled chicken fan, I really love the roasted chicken here. The skin is nice and tasty yet the meat remains juicy and tender. We also get more consistency with the roasted chicken as we tend to realize that the boiled chicken is a bit of a hit and miss, with it sometimes being juicy and tender and other times overcooked and dry. The SoupsAnother trademark of Loy Kee is their soups, with watercress soup being the most popular. The soups are not MSG ladened and my favourite has to be their watercress soup. Served as an individual double boiled bowl or in a traditional soup pot if you order for 2 or more (those old traditional ones our grandmother's used to cook over charcoal), the umami-ness of the pork and the sweetness of the watercress are infused wonderfully into a delightful soup, making it the perfect companion to the chicken rice. The Condiments A chicken rice is only as good as the condiments it comes with and nothing is more important than the holy trinity, Chicken Rice Chilli, Minced ginger and Dark Soy Sauce.While I find the chilli and dark soy sauce here pretty average, the ginger is very nice and adds an even deeper dimension when eaten with the rice. Overview. Again, it's up to personal preference but we really love the rice here and the chicken is good too. Paired along with a soup and the condiment and it makes for one of the best chicken rice in Singapore."

Was it? They need to rename the restaurant.Chicken was nice (definitely not ""the best"") but the portions were too small.  Rice was nice and shiny but lacking any moisture, like it's been sitting around for awhile. The accompanying soup was a notch better than most chicken rice joints. It contained bits of green onions, tomato, and tofu. Unlike some places where it just seems to be a bowl of water from boiling the chicken. Like the option of indoor or outdoor seating. Nice clean shop. Old school decor. Solid seats and tables. The weirdest part about the whole dining experience at Loy Kee was the wait service. We sat down, the waitress handed us the menus, then just stood there waiting to take our order. Usually I'd asked for a few minutes, but this time I decided not to say anything. A couple of minutes passed and I could hear her sighing. That's when I decided to start reading from the menu again ... from the beginning. Thanks for making your customers feel they chose the right place to eat tonight.

RIce is good, not exceptional. It is of a smaller shorter grain. The roasted chicken is better than the steamed chicken, which is quite dry in my opinion. The sauces were given on those small trays and it is very hard to get the attention of the servers to give me more sauce. I asked once and was not given the extra sauces that I asked for. I did not try other dishes. Hence, my review is purely based on the chicken rice & the service only, I will not come back to Balestier just for Loy Kee chicken rice because about 100 metres away, there is Boon Tong Kee, which is way better than this."

I have eaten here probably 15-20 times over the past 6 months. The quality is consistently great and for a restaurant where they serve you, it is frankly underpriced, probably because they are making a dish that is so abundantly available at hawker centers.In and of itself, this place is awesome. The roasted chicken rice is tender and juicy. The bok choy has a lot of those crispy onions on it. They must cook the rice in coconut oil or something for it to taste that good. The only mild downside is that I often want more of the condiments than they give on the tray, especially the thick black vinegar."

But now it has since expanded to Changi and now Novena, the queues are not as bad as it used to be.I happened to walk past the outlet at Novena. The queues only had about 6 customers in front. Maybe because it already 9pm, right the peak dinner time. The queue moved quite fast and the staff at the counter was friendly.I decided on the 3 pieces Chicken Joy meal which costs $9.50. It came with a drink and a side. For side there choices of plain rice, french fries, mashed potato and buttered corn. For drink, there was various choices such as Pepsi, 7-up, Mug and mountain dew.The chicken pieces were available in 2 flavours : original and spicy. I had selected the original. The chicken pieces were quite chunky and meaty.The fried chicken went quite well with the brown gravy sauce."

The smoke was a cool gimmick, but the cocktail needs to still be drinkable and in this case it wasn't. And the quote objectifying women on the mirrored wall was a bit of a turnoff (""Men:  No clothes, no drinks; Ladies"" No clothes, free champagne""), especially for a bar going for such a classy, hipster vibe.  Not super cool.  Still, liked the place and will probably come back on my next visit to Sg."

The safer way to tell which stall is good will be by how long the line is.I only tried the food twice since the renovation. But based on what I had, I liked the Yu Kee Yong Tau Foo very much. I have always like this brand and only had it at Bishan outlet and the old food court at Orchard Emerald. So I am very happy it is available here.The items are standard, different from the other yong tau foo stalls, with 5 pieces of tofu and fish ball/fish cake and the noodles are topped with minced meat. I like the set which includes a side of kang kong drizzled with fermented bean curd. So yummy. The soup is also very sweet and tasty.The mee pok stall is also different with fish maw in it. It is not the best bak chor mee but it is decent. Good choice for Orchard Road. The or luak (oyster omelette) was also nice, especially the chili. Skip the Korean ginseng chicken soup which was very bland.Currently there is a 10% discount if you show your passion card."

You will be welcomed by a variety of cuisines and sometimes an overwhelming crowd. I try to come here for lunch around 11am to beat the usual lunch crowd. Queue's are shorter, and more seats to choose from. My favorite is the fish stall where they serve a variety of ways of cooking fish-deep fried and soup. I tried the deep fried dory twice and it was just ok but when I had the soup dish, it's the constant thing that I order every time I'm here. Also, when it comes to beverages, I don't need to come up to the drinks kiosk, I can just wait for auntie to pass by with her cart of refreshing drinks. One time when I was trying to veer away from the usual lime juice that I order, auntie was really helpful in suggesting other drinks and I opted for the lychee-just to try something new.When you come here, and it happens to be crowded, remember to look for more seats through those corridors and not just settle on the seats you see.

The folks from the Breadtalk Group really know how to make a difference with their food courts - which gives them such an edge above the rest. Each food court has a theme - though most of it relates to our Singaporean heritage, there are some subtle differences. For the most famous Food Republic (and probably with the most expensive rent) it is all back to basics of our Singaporean food roots with the revamp this time round and they have decorated it with all types of vintage items from our past which gives it a really nostalgic flavour and makes it distinctly Singaporean, even if some of the stalls in there hail from different countries and serve other cuisines. It is after all our heritage to have a mishmash of everything. There is a total of 23 stalls, 3 mini restaurants and 1 kiosk. How's that for spoilt for choice? I need to eat at this food court whenever I am in town next time and not bother thinking about restaurants.I would recommend that you make a beeline for their Odeon Beef Noodles - where my favorite is the dry noodles that comes with soup that packs a punch. Otherwise there is always the safe choice of Thye Hong Hokkien noodles which made this branch famous in the first place when it first opened. People are still queuing to this date, which is good. Their Indonesian Padang stall also has rather hefty meals that is sure to fill up a hungry person or 10."

The ingredients are fresh, a little cold, but it enhances the experience (Cold Rojak... now that's an idea!).

The Taiwanese one - Forgot the name, but their claim to fame is beef noodle soups using thick noodles cut by hand.  Supposedly the method of cutting imparts superior texture to give a nice, chewy noodle.  We ordered both the beef dumplings and steamed pork dumplings from this place and they were both fresh and tasty.2. There was one stall that made Laksa (traditional noodle in soup) and Laksa Goreng (noodles only). I liked how they offered you the choice of noodle to use.  Laksa had the usual thin fish slices, shrimp, and some sort of shellfish (cockles perhaps?).  Flavors were bold and intense at the same time.3. Soup Guru(?) - My wife liked this one and went here a few times for traditional Chinese soups.  I liked how they described each soup in English and the traditional health benefits of each.4. They had an Indian restaurant (specializing in Biryani) next to an Indonesian restaurant (with their own special chicken set).  I tried the Chicken Biryani this time and its quite good. They gave a whole small bird with skin and all and a good side of rice and some pickled veggies, all plated on a banana leaf. The ""Biryani sauce"" was given as a side.  Overall it was good - a little different than Biryani I've had here in the USA, but still good.5. Sergeant Chicken - they offered both steam and roasted Hainanese Chicken Rice here for just $4 SGD. I opted for the steamed version and was glad I did.  I never knew that such as a simple dish could have so much flavor.  The rice itself was seasoned with broth and you can always add more with the side of soup they gave you.  The chicken can be eaten with the minced ginger or with the spicy chili oil.6. The fruit juice place is pretty decent too.  They charge slightly more if you decline ice in the drinks.  Coconut juice is actually a whole baby coconut with a good amount of juice and coconut meat to chew on.  The mango and guava(?) are also good with the right amout of tart to help sooth a spicy meal.  I think one of the ladies working here also preloads a bunch of the drinks onto a cart and sells them by bringing the drinks throughout the court - which is really efficient.Our least favorite stall is probably the Fish Porridge one on the corner.  My wife expected a nice smooth congee but instead got this clear soup with cooked rice and fish meat mixed in."

Pasta is pretty tasty with mussels and prawns paired with tomato sauce.Seafood Marinara - $13.90Adding $4.90 to my pasta for set of additional soup of the day and 1 soft drinks. I had the Cream of Brocoli with garlic bread by the side of the double layer bowl. The soup was not quite hot, however still able to warm up the tummy.The environment did leave a good impression.

Also insist in sitting inside even if they tell you they are fully booked and you have to sit outside. was told the reservation would be in an hour but my Gf and I finished our meal in 20mins. yet when a party of 6 walked in just like us, they managed to get seats inside on the ""reserved""  tables. disappointed that they are so inconsistent on thisWould come back again as it's one of the better options in the Tanjong Pagar/Outram Park food places."

I saw many good reviews about the seafood marinara so I wanted to try it out , I thought it would be normal to the others but wow , when I tried , one word ; AWESOME ! I just love the flavor of the rich tomato base . And is worth it cuz they give the portion just nice for you . And the pasta is just too QQ and soft . The prawns is cooked perfectly . But I don't quite like the ice lemon tea , cuz when I tasted , is like its comes from the normal can . I thought it would be homemade . But overall 10/10 !

It was crispy and quite flaky.The chicken mulligatawny soup was both sour and salty. I'm not sure how to describe it but it had a pleasant taste. Then was Bharwan aatish khumbh - tandoori Mushrooms with nuts and cheese. It had a wonderful mix of flavours and a rich nutty taste. It was a bit sweet - which the manager had informed us about when we ordered. So it's not for everyone.We also had the murgh korma - chicken in a slightly sweet, mild rose cashew sauce. I was surprised by how mild it was. It seemingly had no chilli, and just a bit of pepper. I could even taste the rose. It was very pleasant and more subtle than Indian food usually is (though it'll probably be derided by purists). One thing to note is that a good cut of chicken was used, whereas lower end Indian places use cheaper cuts. This isn't necessarily a good thing, since the meat loses some moistness and flavour.To accompany our dishes we had butter roti and lachhna paratha (layered paratha). They were pretty good but they were not hot and the former did not have any palpable liquefied butter. In short, they were a bit old. I told the manager who claimed all the food was made only upon ordering. Well...We also had mango lassi which was excellent with a very intense mango taste.The service was not so good unfortunately. I asked for water and the server forgot. Only when I told the manager did it come. The mushrooms also only came upon my reminding the staff.

I highly recommend the lamb chops masala. Dishes are served with rich, velvety sauces. I suspect a lot of ghee goes into these offerings. As a result, the wife and I usually choose to walk home from Curry Culture to battle the inevitable food coma."

After reading lots of great reviews about this place, we decided to dine here on a Friday night. Getting reservation was easy as we were here an hour before it's closing time. We were seated promptly outside and the server was quick enough to take our orders. We had samosa and papdi chaat as our appetizers. The papdi chaat was better of the two.. very tasty with right amount of tanginess, spices and chilly! The samosa was also good but I enjoyed the chaat more. I often judge an Indian restaurant by the kind of chaats they make. I was in the mood of having some cocktail which will be spicy yet having the good liquor .. the waiter knew perfectly my want and served me the India summer- cocktail with whiskey and spices.. it was the perfect drink I needed on a Friday night. A must try drink if you enjoy some spices! The main course- aloo paratha, Channa masala, tandoori roti and aloo gobi was spot on.. very tasty, flavorful and true to its kind. Definitely fabulous dining experience. The service was excellent and a perfect ambience to have dinner with friends. Next time will love to try non- veg dishes as they seem to be excellent!"

I could drink it all the time, except for the fact that it's so hot here, and that the pub is outdoors, with very little cooling.  They also carry some nice craft beers from the world including some of my faves (Rogue, La Trappe, etc) as well as sake, whiskey and shochu.  JiBiru also specializes in yakitori, and the chicken skewer I had was very tasty - perfectly cooked chicken with just the right amount of char and with a sauce that wasn't overly salty or sweet.   The one thing that could improve here is the service though.  With the number of people working here, I found the service to be strangely inattentive or rather focused on one table only  Maybe they were celebs?  No idea, but in any case, JiBiru is a great place to see what Japanese craft breweries are doing these days with some tasty food to boot."

I was pretty disappointed with there Japanese craft beers. I had a sampler of 4 out of 5 different types, I didn't care for any of them. I then tried a Mocha Amaretto beer they had in a bottle, took about 3 sips then bought a different beverage. The last drink I tried was a mango Apple cider which was actually really refreshing being that it is only outdoor seating in Singapore weather. I tried the smoked duck breast(really bland), the Mochi cheese age( not bad when paired with duck breast), and the Curry croquettes. The curry croquettes are to die for, definitely would recommend them with the cider. All else I wound pass on."

Some of these beers cannot even be found in the Japanese supermarkets around! One of our favorites is the chocolate bottled beer, but it comes in only seasonally. It has a really nice packaging, like what you expect to get on a Japanese beer. This little bar started along with the starting of the mall, and has since updated its menu with a good amount of food items, and expanded the choice of imported beer. This I think is a really good sign for any business, having business owners are willing to progress and make changes for the consumers. I guess they have figured out that Singaporeans still like to munch while drinking. However on the downside, the staff are not very attentive. They will not attend to you until you go and take a seat yourself, from several of my personal experiences. Perhaps it is their style of service, but I cannot really get used to it. Environment wise, I actually like the open atmosphere. That's when I can do my favorite activity - people watching! Perfect spot to chill and watch people as they walk along."

I had tried similar elsewhere but there is no comparison. 2) Baked Honey BBQ Pork Pastry - This pastry was another item here that was the best compared to many other establishments which offered the same. The crust was buttery and flaky in a good way. I only despise flaky when it is associated to humans. The filling was generous with savory honey BBQ pork. 3) Char Siew Bun or Stream BBQ Pork Bun - The buns were so fluffy :9 The fillings which were honey BBQ pork were savory and so good.4) Steam Cheong-Fun with Honey BBQ Pork fillings - Rice flour rolls which were thin and soft. This is how it should be. It was light, healthy and tasted good.5) Deep-Fried Prawn Dumplings with Salad Cream- Generous and fresh prawn fillings in every of the dumplings. The dumplings' skins were so thin and crispy ;D  AMBIENCE 5/5No tacky décor but elegant beautiful surrounding. Comfy plushy chairs, nice table settings and lots of seatings. SERVICE 5/5Jorrine the hostess at the door had been working here for years. I recognized her. Always friendly and hospitable. She led me to one of the room inside. The server Shaun took very good care of me the moment I sat down. He was very pleasant, well-mannered and attentive. Taste Paradise has never let me down.

This is truly a well deserving 5 stars establishment in Singapore and ranked the top among all the 5 stars restaurants I rated."

Ordered three items: baked bbq pork bun, soup dumplings, and shark fin soup. I liked the pork bun and soup dumplings. The pork bun dough was crisp on the outside and the meat inside had a lot of flavour. The wrapper is thin and strong that holds the soup and meat well, that's how you know it's good wrapper. It was my first time eating shark fin soup. The soup was light and there's a huge dumpling that holds all the meat. The shark fins all dispersed when I opened the dumpling. All in all, it was a good experience."

Opted for the Peking Duck, Wasabi Prawns, and Foie Gras appetizer which was just heavenly! Peking duck was perfectly crispy and the wasabi Prawns was flavored to perfection. The foie gras was decent. Entrees included the salted egg prawns which consisted of a dozen or so juicy and flavorful prawns lightly fried and then dipped in salted egg yolk. Yum!The US beef with Gai Lan was also excellent. ...it was rather odd having US beef in Singapore. ...trust me on this one!Next came the Kurobata Pork with mushrooms which was also heavenly! Super tender pork in a world class gravy. Ended off the meal with Lobster with XO sauce noodles and their famous mango pomelo sago. Lobster was delicious and their XO sauce was on point.

If I would have to classify it, this is a fine dining Chinese restaurant. Extensive, but well appointed decor throughout, clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant. Very comfortable sitting, nice tablecloth - all sets you in a mood. To prove that this is a fine dining restaurant, it offers a great wine selection, which includes practically all first growth Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Mouton Rothschild, ...), as well as Petrus, Massetto, DRC and if I was not mistaken, even a cult California Screaming Eagle. We had 2011 Rauzan-Sègla with our dinner, and the wine was outstanding after 20 minutes in the glass. Excellent service, starting with wine and food pairing recommendations. Considering our choice of wine, we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of Peking duck, as crispy duck is less sweet - and the recommendation was spot on, excellent pairing - also the duck was cooked perfectly. We also had tofu and green beans, each dish is excellent on its own. One of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce. We also had the dessert - fresh mango purée with an ice cream, which is also beautifully presented on top of cold steaming bowl - another high point of the dinner experience.Once again, excellent service - prompt, attentive, helpful and friendly. Definitely recommended."

Because I can definitely get used to this.First, let's start with their impeccable service. The servers here are polite, friendly and actively try to engage in conversation. They see you as an actual person rather than just another customer, constantly checking in to make sure everything is up to standards.Their interior is very similar to hotel restaurants you find in mainland China, with revolving round tables and private VIP rooms. Their food might come out a bit slow, but it's worth it given the fantastic quality. The shark fin soup is best I've had anywhere. Clear, crisp broth with subdued flavoring that enhances the shark fin rather than overpowering it (which is something I've experienced on numerous occasion in the past). The spring roll that comes with it also adds another element in the texture department, with the flaky, crispy shell playing foil to the soft fins. Their garlic fried and boiled lobster was also delicious, offering two interesting takes on the classic lobster dish. The fried pieces weren't overly greasy, and had enough meat to counterbalance the shell. The boiled meats, however, were the real creme de la creme. Served in a butter garlic sauce, each tender piece of meat melted the moment it entered your mouth, delivering an explosion of flavor. Among the other dishes, I thought their Peking duck was cooked perfectly, though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking. Their braised pork cubes and steak bits were also pretty good, though a bit on the fatty side. In terms of drinks, there was nothing too standout, so I'd recommend just sticking to Tiger. All in all, a fantastic dining experience at one of my favorite places in Singapore."

They still serve dim sum at that time. Yay!We ordered the usual char siew so, which is extremely delicate and crispy! It is a must order dish here. Next, came the XO carrot cake, which I heard so much about. It tastes good and the carrot cake is chunky. I think another place which may be better than here or on par is at Chinatown's Spring Court. I honestly, couldn't be bothered with taking photos subsequently cuz the food was just too delicieus to ignore. We had the braised foie gras in blueberry reduction! It is super yummy!!! I would say it is basically foie gras terrine with blueberry jam! Crackling pork belly could be one of the best served in Singapore. I could have a whole plate to myself.

Crispy and crunchy skin with tender flesh and a sliver of fat, not too much, just enough to be justifiable for those counting calories.Whilst most rave about dim sum here (best dish in my humble opnion is mango prawn, not quite the traditional favourite, but the best one for me), I thought their usual fare was more impressive. Winter melon soup was served steaming hot in a hollowed out winter melon, a little corny but may be the reason it tasted better than others. Cod was very well cooked and it made my day that my mango sago came with a trailing smokey stream of dry ice; for only $4.50, I was getting all the fireworks.The restaurant is lavishly decorated, typical of chinese opulence but with just a touch of modernity. It may annoy you that the wait staff continuously stress that you can only stay for 45min/1hr/1.5hr before you have to vacate your table, but service is prompt and attentive, and the quality of food easily makes up for everything else."

They do at least two seatings at lunch.The Carrot Cake is excellent. A re-interpretation of a hawker favourite. And well interpreted, I think. The addition of succulent bean sprouts is so welcome.The roast pork (siew yoke) was recommended to us. It comes in a slab that has been cut down to look like it came out of a factory. It was okay, but for me, nothing remarkable in the way it was done.The roast duck was good, if you like a roast duck that is trying to be a chicken. ie a little too juicy. I prefer duck that is like duck - allowed to be a little drier. But that's just a personal thing. It is very high quality, with crisp skin.Between two roasts, take the duck.There's some mango dim sum thing, fried and with too much mayo. To me, unless you are a huge mayo fan, it was cloying and just too mayo-ey. Why did Singapore ever think mayo and mango is a good combination? Or mayo and prawn? Ugh!There's also a laksa bean curd dim sum dish. It was all right.Chee Cheong Fun also okay.I like that there's an attempt at incorporating local dishes/flavours rather than just offering standard Cantonese dim sum.It's a pity that during the day time the curtains are drawn and you can't see outside. So it feels like it's night time at Ion. And some of the placement of tables is quite awkward."

The spare ribs in sweet sauce is the first dish that comes to mind - caramelised sauce hangs off succulent tender meat that you won't be able to get enough of. The tasty crackling skin of the peking duck wrapped in thin popiah sheets is also probably one of the best I've ever tasted in Singapore. Another must-try would be the perfectly baked cod that simply melts in your mouth.

Food : M and I are fans of the salted egg yolk custard bun! Taste Paradise offers one of the best salted egg yolk buns in Singapore ... my only gripe is that they only offer the steamed version and not the deep fried mantou version at Man Fu Yuan. Their har gau (shrimp dumplings) and siew mai (pork dumplings) are very fresh and well executed. May, the manager of Taste Paradise informs us that they are made fresh every morning. I really liked the prawn mango roll which is encased in a lightly crumbed roll instead of beancurd skin. Mayonnaise is also thoughtfully included in the roll, so it all oozes out nicely in one moreish bite. The char siew sou (puffs) are really quite awesome, good meat to pastry ratio and the latter is light, buttery and flaky. The carrot cake with XO sauce is not bad but I prefer the one at Space @ My Humble House. The steamed beancurd skin with bacon rolls are pretty awesome as well but the wu kok (deep fried yam puffs) don't taste as good as they look. The double boiled soups are also excellent ... very tasty and great for a cold day. The dessert of aloe vera with ice jelly and wolf berries is extremely refreshing too.Ambience : I like how they have private rooms so one can request for them if one chooses not to be caught up in the hustle and bustle in the main dining hall. The layout is a bit labyrinth-like but nice modern Chinese decor with pictures of the different emperors from various dynasties in the private rooms. Service : Prompt, polite and overall perfect. May runs a tight ship and trains her staff well.Will be back for dinner soon!"

In terms of what they offer, it is a blend of dim sum and various Asian Fusion dishes. How this restaurant works is that you wait to be seated, they give you the menu, and then you check off what you want on the smaller paper menu that is sitting at each table. The main menu has a lot of photos so if you're not quite sure what you want to eat it's pretty easy to get a clearer perspective of what that may be.This restaurant can get very crowded, so don't expect the staff to be highly aware of your presence and cater to all of your needs. Meaning, you really have to ask them to come over if you want to get any service. Though, once they get there, they are fairly efficient in doing their job. In terms of interior design, there are numerous tables throughout this restaurant. Many of them are situated very close to one another. Personally, I like a little space when I eat so I can enjoy my meal and my conversation with the person I am dining with. But, due to the fact that Masa's tables are fairly close to one another, you may have somebody sitting elbow-to-elbow with you, depending on where they actually seat you. Just keep this in mind, because this may not be the atmosphere you wish to dine in.Overall, the food here is pretty good and it is an easy place to get to and grab a quick meal."

I visited this location back in March 2017.I love how this was a simple, fast, breakfast place that serves a hearty food. My mom and I ordered and our meal showed up maybe 5 minutes later. I got pre-set menus that came with Kaya toast and a soft boiled egg. Fishball noodle soup. Yum!This place is where locals grab a quick bite to eat before they move on with their day. It's seat yourself but could also end up sharing tables. It's semi outdoor seating so if you're into A/C, this might not be the location for you. I think tissues are 30 cents so remember to bring your own. After you're done, you can walk off your breakfast through the strip of nicely air conditioned malls!"

Before I texted my sis before to go ahead and order first. A bespectacled server came to me, demanded rudely that if I was not planning to eat anything, I must put on a mask. Was she kidding?? Why must she be so rude?? I countered back ""Yea!! I am eating!!"" During Phase 2 after the ""Circuit Breaker"" (aka shelter in place"", everyone in Singapore still needs to wear a mask when they are out and about. People can now dine in restaurants with social distancing procedures in place. Back to that server, why must she used that kind of tone to talk to me, a customer?? Ugh.. again I have to say this.. is it that hard to be polite to paying customers (Reminded me of that rude server at TCC restaurant @ Marina Bay Sands last year) ? Where was her service or manners?? She should simply say this:   ""Hi there! Sorry, if you do not plan to be eating, would you please put on your mask? Thank you for your understanding!""It is NOT that hard!!!!! My sister just asked me to eat whatever she ordered which were already served at the table. I may not kick a big fuss there, I surely not going to let this slide. I would throw hands the next time I visit there. I really wanted to try the soufflé pancake!My mood was ruined but I had to say the seafood pancake was really good! There was also this basket of korean chickens which was not bad either. The ginseng ade was really good!Ambience here is definitely 5 stars. Service was a 0 (the owner should thank their rude staff).

Because of dietary restrictions, I either avoid sandwich shops unless they have a low or no carb option. Although it is not on their menu, Rebel owners Wei Li and Sandy and their team are there to listen to your dietary needs and customize with their products.They listened and surprised me with a huge and delicious bowl packed with vegan and meat proteins, fresh vegetables and avocado. Vegan chicken nuggets are genius. They eerily tasted like chicken in flavor and texture. The tempeh is textuurrific! It has a satisfying bite and chew. I loved eating these with their Nuclear spicy sauce. The omelette perfectly fine cooked, great consistency and taste. I enjoyed their fresh, chunky rich avocado and Vietnamese julienned daikon radish and carrot pickle. This went so went with the chicken patties. The Thai chicken patty had notes that hinted of Thai fishcake. The Vietnamese chicken tastes like the meats in a Banh Mi sandwich. The cilantro brought those flavors together. There are no fillers and icky additives in their patties or other products. They at in the process of getting their restaurant certified halal.I also tried their delicious soups. I had the tomato soup and the mushroom soup. The tomato is good, but the mushroom is divine, the I-CANNOT-STOP-MYSELF divine. They are served with seasoned breadsticks which act as spoons. The reduce the use of disposable silverware. They gave me one because I don't eat bread. Wei Li and Sandy took the time to check on their customers and tell their story.

The portion size for the large is quite generous, and was definitely filling for me. The salmon and salmon belly were both very flavorful and had a nice texture. I wasn't a huge fan of the other fish, but they tasted pretty decent. The ikura was a bit too fishy for me though.- Aburi Kaizen Chirashi Don: This is the same as the Kaizen Chirashi Don, except the fish are all seared a bit. This is more expensive, and I overall felt the regular bowl was better. The searing tastes off a bit too much of the flavor for some of the fish.- Sake Sashimi: 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. Very tasty but was a bit pricey for the portion.Service:No problem with the service, but be prepared to wait if you come at peak times. I came on a weekday and the restaurant was nearly full (with a lot of reserved tables already).Price: $$/$$$The Chirashi Dons were both $26.90, though the normal one was a Large size and the Aburi one was a regular size.

Overall, the service was super quick and food appeared almost instantly.I will join the choir and sing praise for their kaisen chirashi don: it really is as amazing as you read in the reviews (and the reviews of their other location). The fish was amazing, the slices were thick and super fresh. I had trouble finishing the normal size don (granted I had a late and rather big lunch) which is a first!Highly recommended!"

Yes I've heard about this place also having one of the most worth it chirashi sets at a good price. Well... Everyone was right! As seen on Yelp, I went for the popular items right away - the scallop mentaiko carpaccio to share, I had the premium chirashi and my friend being a smaller eater had the normal chirashi. The premium chirashi even came with uni inside with big and plump ikura! Everything was generally very fresh, however the prawn was a bit slimy and strong tasting to be absolutely honest. Everything else was to expectation and a little above, given the great feedback all over the Internet. One thing about this place that really stuck out was their stuff which are aburi-ied (flame torched) ! Anything that they flame torched wasn't just for show. It really does bring out that extra flavour! They seemed like masters at it. Even down to the scallop mentaiko carpaccio! That smokey flavour.... I miss it already!They seem to have a chirashi bowl that is all aburi (torched on one side and raw behind)! I absolutely can't wait to go back and try that! I'm giving this outlet 4.2 out of 5 stars! Would have been slightly higher if it weren't for that lousy prawn! ;)"

Blasphemy, I know!  I find that the food selection here is a lot more extensive than the original. The Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, which in my view, is the STAR dish of this restaurant, is not available at the original location, from what I remember. Second, the Ngee Ann City space is far larger and has much more of a restaurant feel than the hole-in-the-wall experience at the original location. Third, the queue is a tad bit shorter.  In any event, the aburi dishes are the real winners of The Sushi Bar, separateing them from every other sushi restaurant in Singapore. I'm not familiar with the term ""aburi"", but from what I understand, it is essentially grilled/torched raw fish. The Sushi Bar has perfected the art of torching high quality sushi, leaving the edges burnt with the inside nice and raw. Simply, an awesome combination. In short, depending on whether you fancy chirashi or sushi, you should order either the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, Salmon Aburi Roll or both!"

Service, however, is brusque and sullen. The aburi salmon roll they are famous for is flavourful at first bite. The dollops of mayo on top lends it sweetness and creaminess, with a touch of saltiness that accentuates the other flavours. However, once you remove the dollop of mayo on top, the roll itself is extremely average. Though fatty and plump, the salmon itself is not particularly flavourful. The filling of avocado and crab stick and lean maguro don't contribute much in terms of flavour too. So I would say the star of the dish is the mayo! :)  There are better quality sushi options out there at a similar price point."
