It started with the preserved duck egg which I would actually recommend (just don't ask for a full description until after you eat it!). For the entree we had chicken rice which was awesome. I definitely recommend this for a local meal. We also had the green dragon vegetables (delicious!) and a tofu soup that was awesome. The overall restaurant was very nice and clean and clearly it's a place that locals frequent. I would definitely recommend for a sit down meal and good local flavors.

Boon Tong Kee is often regarded as one of local favorite spots where families and friends gather for good times over delicious Cantonese home-style food. Many regulars come to Boon Tong Kee primarily for their Signature Boiled Chicken or Famous Chicken Rice, also known for its silky white sauce chicken rice. Although chicken is the signature dish here, there is a wide selection of irresistible creations you wouldn't want to miss out. Some of the notable mentions such as Fried Bean Sprouts with Salted Fish, Fried Assorted Vegetables (Kang Kong) with Sambal, Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Eggs and Crispy Deep Fried Chicken are quite popular. The options are simply too many to list... if you have the appetite and the belly, I'd say explore and try as much as you can indulge."

Went thru the menu but It took a full 8 mins before our order was taken. The restaurant was not that full. A couple who came after us was served before us. My wife wanted to walk out, but as good people, we waited. Finally the chicken dish arrived and we tucked in to succulent meal.

The other stuff they try to push on you is passable but just stick with the chicken rice and all will be well. Came here on the second day of CNY and the line was insane with over an hour wait. We had heard the claypot rice here was quite popular and thus we ordered ahead while waiting for our table so the timing synced up. Alas, the claypot rice is alright but very forgettable. But the dependable staples didn't disappoint. Love the fragrant savory rice here. I can eat bowls of it! Paired with the silken white skin and moist chicken, it just works. Another staple, that fried tofu. Impeccable delicate and soft on the inside with a light crispy exterior. I don't know how it holds its texture but when dipped in the salad dressing, so yummy! Oh and that char siew that's already on your table when you're seated... it's just sublime. Being CNY, we also ordered lo hei for some festive cheer and our server was really personable in preparing it. But for everyday classics that won't disappoint, the chicken rice, fried tofu, and char siew are winners for sure. Also this location is open late which is a plus for supper cravings."

The restaurant is clean and the staff have the usual stiff upper lip until you warm them up with some ""xie xie's"" and attempting to banter with them. We of course ordered a plate of HC which come with individual bowls of rice (hells yeh). The chicken never fails, especially when you top it off with ginger, sweet soy and chilli. We also ordered a range of dishes from fried tofu (hells yes), baby spinach with salted and century egg, a Cantonese fave, broccoli and mushrooms, ""gourmet"" fried spring rolls and the seafood horfun. Special shout outs to the tofu which was light with the perfect amount of salty coating and the horfun. Sweet baby J, the horfun was to die for. The sheets themselves were the fattest I've seen. The seafood fresh. The sauce, solid. I was so full but kept going back for more. Downside: A LOT of MSG. MSG is killing my food vibe in Singapore.

Flaky , moist and just seasoned right. The sauce didnt overpower and just the right amount. It was delish.

After declining, I asked for iced water and instead got some weird coconut drink. If you can't even understand the word ""water"" that's definitely a problem. She did manage to get the rest of our order correct, probably because I pointed on the menu.Despite this, my dad truly enjoyed it, and our bill was under $20.

Unfortunately, it's a little far for me to constantly visit them but they are still one of my favorite chicken rice restaurants to visit when I have the craving. With all the chicken rice stalls and restaurants popping up, with one receiving a Bib Gourmand from Singapore's Michelin guide, what differentiates Loy Kee from the rest of the pack?Why it is still my Go To place for chicken rice. Firstly, the rice. Unlike most places that tend to offer healthier options these days, Loy Kee doesn't. Is it sinful? YES! But it's also bursting with flavour and nothing makes me happier than having oily lips with every mouthful of rice (best time to kiss a loved one). The Chicken. What's popular now is boneless chicken rice, where they skillfully remove all the bones, either from the breast or thighs and serve it beautifully presented on a plate. I, on the other hand, love picking meat of the bones as that's where all the flavours are. Despite being a huge boiled chicken fan, I really love the roasted chicken here. The skin is nice and tasty yet the meat remains juicy and tender. We also get more consistency with the roasted chicken as we tend to realize that the boiled chicken is a bit of a hit and miss, with it sometimes being juicy and tender and other times overcooked and dry. The SoupsAnother trademark of Loy Kee is their soups, with watercress soup being the most popular. The soups are not MSG ladened and my favourite has to be their watercress soup. Served as an individual double boiled bowl or in a traditional soup pot if you order for 2 or more (those old traditional ones our grandmother's used to cook over charcoal), the umami-ness of the pork and the sweetness of the watercress are infused wonderfully into a delightful soup, making it the perfect companion to the chicken rice. The Condiments A chicken rice is only as good as the condiments it comes with and nothing is more important than the holy trinity, Chicken Rice Chilli, Minced ginger and Dark Soy Sauce.While I find the chilli and dark soy sauce here pretty average, the ginger is very nice and adds an even deeper dimension when eaten with the rice. Overview. Again, it's up to personal preference but we really love the rice here and the chicken is good too. Paired along with a soup and the condiment and it makes for one of the best chicken rice in Singapore."

Was it? They need to rename the restaurant.Chicken was nice (definitely not ""the best"") but the portions were too small.  Rice was nice and shiny but lacking any moisture, like it's been sitting around for awhile. The accompanying soup was a notch better than most chicken rice joints. It contained bits of green onions, tomato, and tofu. Unlike some places where it just seems to be a bowl of water from boiling the chicken. Like the option of indoor or outdoor seating. Nice clean shop. Old school decor. Solid seats and tables. The weirdest part about the whole dining experience at Loy Kee was the wait service. We sat down, the waitress handed us the menus, then just stood there waiting to take our order. Usually I'd asked for a few minutes, but this time I decided not to say anything. A couple of minutes passed and I could hear her sighing. That's when I decided to start reading from the menu again ... from the beginning. Thanks for making your customers feel they chose the right place to eat tonight.

RIce is good, not exceptional. It is of a smaller shorter grain. The roasted chicken is better than the steamed chicken, which is quite dry in my opinion. The sauces were given on those small trays and it is very hard to get the attention of the servers to give me more sauce. I asked once and was not given the extra sauces that I asked for. I did not try other dishes. Hence, my review is purely based on the chicken rice & the service only, I will not come back to Balestier just for Loy Kee chicken rice because about 100 metres away, there is Boon Tong Kee, which is way better than this."

I have eaten here probably 15-20 times over the past 6 months. The quality is consistently great and for a restaurant where they serve you, it is frankly underpriced, probably because they are making a dish that is so abundantly available at hawker centers.In and of itself, this place is awesome. The roasted chicken rice is tender and juicy. The bok choy has a lot of those crispy onions on it. They must cook the rice in coconut oil or something for it to taste that good. The only mild downside is that I often want more of the condiments than they give on the tray, especially the thick black vinegar."

But now it has since expanded to Changi and now Novena, the queues are not as bad as it used to be.I happened to walk past the outlet at Novena. The queues only had about 6 customers in front. Maybe because it already 9pm, right the peak dinner time. The queue moved quite fast and the staff at the counter was friendly.I decided on the 3 pieces Chicken Joy meal which costs $9.50. It came with a drink and a side. For side there choices of plain rice, french fries, mashed potato and buttered corn. For drink, there was various choices such as Pepsi, 7-up, Mug and mountain dew.The chicken pieces were available in 2 flavours : original and spicy. I had selected the original. The chicken pieces were quite chunky and meaty.The fried chicken went quite well with the brown gravy sauce."

The smoke was a cool gimmick, but the cocktail needs to still be drinkable and in this case it wasn't. And the quote objectifying women on the mirrored wall was a bit of a turnoff (""Men:  No clothes, no drinks; Ladies"" No clothes, free champagne""), especially for a bar going for such a classy, hipster vibe.  Not super cool.  Still, liked the place and will probably come back on my next visit to Sg."

The safer way to tell which stall is good will be by how long the line is.I only tried the food twice since the renovation. But based on what I had, I liked the Yu Kee Yong Tau Foo very much. I have always like this brand and only had it at Bishan outlet and the old food court at Orchard Emerald. So I am very happy it is available here.The items are standard, different from the other yong tau foo stalls, with 5 pieces of tofu and fish ball/fish cake and the noodles are topped with minced meat. I like the set which includes a side of kang kong drizzled with fermented bean curd. So yummy. The soup is also very sweet and tasty.The mee pok stall is also different with fish maw in it. It is not the best bak chor mee but it is decent. Good choice for Orchard Road. The or luak (oyster omelette) was also nice, especially the chili. Skip the Korean ginseng chicken soup which was very bland.Currently there is a 10% discount if you show your passion card."

You will be welcomed by a variety of cuisines and sometimes an overwhelming crowd. I try to come here for lunch around 11am to beat the usual lunch crowd. Queue's are shorter, and more seats to choose from. My favorite is the fish stall where they serve a variety of ways of cooking fish-deep fried and soup. I tried the deep fried dory twice and it was just ok but when I had the soup dish, it's the constant thing that I order every time I'm here. Also, when it comes to beverages, I don't need to come up to the drinks kiosk, I can just wait for auntie to pass by with her cart of refreshing drinks. One time when I was trying to veer away from the usual lime juice that I order, auntie was really helpful in suggesting other drinks and I opted for the lychee-just to try something new.When you come here, and it happens to be crowded, remember to look for more seats through those corridors and not just settle on the seats you see.

The folks from the Breadtalk Group really know how to make a difference with their food courts - which gives them such an edge above the rest. Each food court has a theme - though most of it relates to our Singaporean heritage, there are some subtle differences. For the most famous Food Republic (and probably with the most expensive rent) it is all back to basics of our Singaporean food roots with the revamp this time round and they have decorated it with all types of vintage items from our past which gives it a really nostalgic flavour and makes it distinctly Singaporean, even if some of the stalls in there hail from different countries and serve other cuisines. It is after all our heritage to have a mishmash of everything. There is a total of 23 stalls, 3 mini restaurants and 1 kiosk. How's that for spoilt for choice? I need to eat at this food court whenever I am in town next time and not bother thinking about restaurants.I would recommend that you make a beeline for their Odeon Beef Noodles - where my favorite is the dry noodles that comes with soup that packs a punch. Otherwise there is always the safe choice of Thye Hong Hokkien noodles which made this branch famous in the first place when it first opened. People are still queuing to this date, which is good. Their Indonesian Padang stall also has rather hefty meals that is sure to fill up a hungry person or 10."

The ingredients are fresh, a little cold, but it enhances the experience (Cold Rojak... now that's an idea!).

The Taiwanese one - Forgot the name, but their claim to fame is beef noodle soups using thick noodles cut by hand.  Supposedly the method of cutting imparts superior texture to give a nice, chewy noodle.  We ordered both the beef dumplings and steamed pork dumplings from this place and they were both fresh and tasty.2. There was one stall that made Laksa (traditional noodle in soup) and Laksa Goreng (noodles only). I liked how they offered you the choice of noodle to use.  Laksa had the usual thin fish slices, shrimp, and some sort of shellfish (cockles perhaps?).  Flavors were bold and intense at the same time.3. Soup Guru(?) - My wife liked this one and went here a few times for traditional Chinese soups.  I liked how they described each soup in English and the traditional health benefits of each.4. They had an Indian restaurant (specializing in Biryani) next to an Indonesian restaurant (with their own special chicken set).  I tried the Chicken Biryani this time and its quite good. They gave a whole small bird with skin and all and a good side of rice and some pickled veggies, all plated on a banana leaf. The ""Biryani sauce"" was given as a side.  Overall it was good - a little different than Biryani I've had here in the USA, but still good.5. Sergeant Chicken - they offered both steam and roasted Hainanese Chicken Rice here for just $4 SGD. I opted for the steamed version and was glad I did.  I never knew that such as a simple dish could have so much flavor.  The rice itself was seasoned with broth and you can always add more with the side of soup they gave you.  The chicken can be eaten with the minced ginger or with the spicy chili oil.6. The fruit juice place is pretty decent too.  They charge slightly more if you decline ice in the drinks.  Coconut juice is actually a whole baby coconut with a good amount of juice and coconut meat to chew on.  The mango and guava(?) are also good with the right amout of tart to help sooth a spicy meal.  I think one of the ladies working here also preloads a bunch of the drinks onto a cart and sells them by bringing the drinks throughout the court - which is really efficient.Our least favorite stall is probably the Fish Porridge one on the corner.  My wife expected a nice smooth congee but instead got this clear soup with cooked rice and fish meat mixed in."

Pasta is pretty tasty with mussels and prawns paired with tomato sauce.Seafood Marinara - $13.90Adding $4.90 to my pasta for set of additional soup of the day and 1 soft drinks. I had the Cream of Brocoli with garlic bread by the side of the double layer bowl. The soup was not quite hot, however still able to warm up the tummy.The environment did leave a good impression.

Also insist in sitting inside even if they tell you they are fully booked and you have to sit outside. was told the reservation would be in an hour but my Gf and I finished our meal in 20mins. yet when a party of 6 walked in just like us, they managed to get seats inside on the ""reserved""  tables. disappointed that they are so inconsistent on thisWould come back again as it's one of the better options in the Tanjong Pagar/Outram Park food places."

I saw many good reviews about the seafood marinara so I wanted to try it out , I thought it would be normal to the others but wow , when I tried , one word ; AWESOME ! I just love the flavor of the rich tomato base . And is worth it cuz they give the portion just nice for you . And the pasta is just too QQ and soft . The prawns is cooked perfectly . But I don't quite like the ice lemon tea , cuz when I tasted , is like its comes from the normal can . I thought it would be homemade . But overall 10/10 !

It was crispy and quite flaky.The chicken mulligatawny soup was both sour and salty. I'm not sure how to describe it but it had a pleasant taste. Then was Bharwan aatish khumbh - tandoori Mushrooms with nuts and cheese. It had a wonderful mix of flavours and a rich nutty taste. It was a bit sweet - which the manager had informed us about when we ordered. So it's not for everyone.We also had the murgh korma - chicken in a slightly sweet, mild rose cashew sauce. I was surprised by how mild it was. It seemingly had no chilli, and just a bit of pepper. I could even taste the rose. It was very pleasant and more subtle than Indian food usually is (though it'll probably be derided by purists). One thing to note is that a good cut of chicken was used, whereas lower end Indian places use cheaper cuts. This isn't necessarily a good thing, since the meat loses some moistness and flavour.To accompany our dishes we had butter roti and lachhna paratha (layered paratha). They were pretty good but they were not hot and the former did not have any palpable liquefied butter. In short, they were a bit old. I told the manager who claimed all the food was made only upon ordering. Well...We also had mango lassi which was excellent with a very intense mango taste.The service was not so good unfortunately. I asked for water and the server forgot. Only when I told the manager did it come. The mushrooms also only came upon my reminding the staff.

I highly recommend the lamb chops masala. Dishes are served with rich, velvety sauces. I suspect a lot of ghee goes into these offerings. As a result, the wife and I usually choose to walk home from Curry Culture to battle the inevitable food coma."

After reading lots of great reviews about this place, we decided to dine here on a Friday night. Getting reservation was easy as we were here an hour before it's closing time. We were seated promptly outside and the server was quick enough to take our orders. We had samosa and papdi chaat as our appetizers. The papdi chaat was better of the two.. very tasty with right amount of tanginess, spices and chilly! The samosa was also good but I enjoyed the chaat more. I often judge an Indian restaurant by the kind of chaats they make. I was in the mood of having some cocktail which will be spicy yet having the good liquor .. the waiter knew perfectly my want and served me the India summer- cocktail with whiskey and spices.. it was the perfect drink I needed on a Friday night. A must try drink if you enjoy some spices! The main course- aloo paratha, Channa masala, tandoori roti and aloo gobi was spot on.. very tasty, flavorful and true to its kind. Definitely fabulous dining experience. The service was excellent and a perfect ambience to have dinner with friends. Next time will love to try non- veg dishes as they seem to be excellent!"

I could drink it all the time, except for the fact that it's so hot here, and that the pub is outdoors, with very little cooling.  They also carry some nice craft beers from the world including some of my faves (Rogue, La Trappe, etc) as well as sake, whiskey and shochu.  JiBiru also specializes in yakitori, and the chicken skewer I had was very tasty - perfectly cooked chicken with just the right amount of char and with a sauce that wasn't overly salty or sweet.   The one thing that could improve here is the service though.  With the number of people working here, I found the service to be strangely inattentive or rather focused on one table only  Maybe they were celebs?  No idea, but in any case, JiBiru is a great place to see what Japanese craft breweries are doing these days with some tasty food to boot."

I was pretty disappointed with there Japanese craft beers. I had a sampler of 4 out of 5 different types, I didn't care for any of them. I then tried a Mocha Amaretto beer they had in a bottle, took about 3 sips then bought a different beverage. The last drink I tried was a mango Apple cider which was actually really refreshing being that it is only outdoor seating in Singapore weather. I tried the smoked duck breast(really bland), the Mochi cheese age( not bad when paired with duck breast), and the Curry croquettes. The curry croquettes are to die for, definitely would recommend them with the cider. All else I wound pass on."

Some of these beers cannot even be found in the Japanese supermarkets around! One of our favorites is the chocolate bottled beer, but it comes in only seasonally. It has a really nice packaging, like what you expect to get on a Japanese beer. This little bar started along with the starting of the mall, and has since updated its menu with a good amount of food items, and expanded the choice of imported beer. This I think is a really good sign for any business, having business owners are willing to progress and make changes for the consumers. I guess they have figured out that Singaporeans still like to munch while drinking. However on the downside, the staff are not very attentive. They will not attend to you until you go and take a seat yourself, from several of my personal experiences. Perhaps it is their style of service, but I cannot really get used to it. Environment wise, I actually like the open atmosphere. That's when I can do my favorite activity - people watching! Perfect spot to chill and watch people as they walk along."

I had tried similar elsewhere but there is no comparison. 2) Baked Honey BBQ Pork Pastry - This pastry was another item here that was the best compared to many other establishments which offered the same. The crust was buttery and flaky in a good way. I only despise flaky when it is associated to humans. The filling was generous with savory honey BBQ pork. 3) Char Siew Bun or Stream BBQ Pork Bun - The buns were so fluffy :9 The fillings which were honey BBQ pork were savory and so good.4) Steam Cheong-Fun with Honey BBQ Pork fillings - Rice flour rolls which were thin and soft. This is how it should be. It was light, healthy and tasted good.5) Deep-Fried Prawn Dumplings with Salad Cream- Generous and fresh prawn fillings in every of the dumplings. The dumplings' skins were so thin and crispy ;D  AMBIENCE 5/5No tacky décor but elegant beautiful surrounding. Comfy plushy chairs, nice table settings and lots of seatings. SERVICE 5/5Jorrine the hostess at the door had been working here for years. I recognized her. Always friendly and hospitable. She led me to one of the room inside. The server Shaun took very good care of me the moment I sat down. He was very pleasant, well-mannered and attentive. Taste Paradise has never let me down.

This is truly a well deserving 5 stars establishment in Singapore and ranked the top among all the 5 stars restaurants I rated."

Ordered three items: baked bbq pork bun, soup dumplings, and shark fin soup. I liked the pork bun and soup dumplings. The pork bun dough was crisp on the outside and the meat inside had a lot of flavour. The wrapper is thin and strong that holds the soup and meat well, that's how you know it's good wrapper. It was my first time eating shark fin soup. The soup was light and there's a huge dumpling that holds all the meat. The shark fins all dispersed when I opened the dumpling. All in all, it was a good experience."

Opted for the Peking Duck, Wasabi Prawns, and Foie Gras appetizer which was just heavenly! Peking duck was perfectly crispy and the wasabi Prawns was flavored to perfection. The foie gras was decent. Entrees included the salted egg prawns which consisted of a dozen or so juicy and flavorful prawns lightly fried and then dipped in salted egg yolk. Yum!The US beef with Gai Lan was also excellent. ...it was rather odd having US beef in Singapore. ...trust me on this one!Next came the Kurobata Pork with mushrooms which was also heavenly! Super tender pork in a world class gravy. Ended off the meal with Lobster with XO sauce noodles and their famous mango pomelo sago. Lobster was delicious and their XO sauce was on point.

If I would have to classify it, this is a fine dining Chinese restaurant. Extensive, but well appointed decor throughout, clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant. Very comfortable sitting, nice tablecloth - all sets you in a mood. To prove that this is a fine dining restaurant, it offers a great wine selection, which includes practically all first growth Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Mouton Rothschild, ...), as well as Petrus, Massetto, DRC and if I was not mistaken, even a cult California Screaming Eagle. We had 2011 Rauzan-Sègla with our dinner, and the wine was outstanding after 20 minutes in the glass. Excellent service, starting with wine and food pairing recommendations. Considering our choice of wine, we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of Peking duck, as crispy duck is less sweet - and the recommendation was spot on, excellent pairing - also the duck was cooked perfectly. We also had tofu and green beans, each dish is excellent on its own. One of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce. We also had the dessert - fresh mango purée with an ice cream, which is also beautifully presented on top of cold steaming bowl - another high point of the dinner experience.Once again, excellent service - prompt, attentive, helpful and friendly. Definitely recommended."

Because I can definitely get used to this.First, let's start with their impeccable service. The servers here are polite, friendly and actively try to engage in conversation. They see you as an actual person rather than just another customer, constantly checking in to make sure everything is up to standards.Their interior is very similar to hotel restaurants you find in mainland China, with revolving round tables and private VIP rooms. Their food might come out a bit slow, but it's worth it given the fantastic quality. The shark fin soup is best I've had anywhere. Clear, crisp broth with subdued flavoring that enhances the shark fin rather than overpowering it (which is something I've experienced on numerous occasion in the past). The spring roll that comes with it also adds another element in the texture department, with the flaky, crispy shell playing foil to the soft fins. Their garlic fried and boiled lobster was also delicious, offering two interesting takes on the classic lobster dish. The fried pieces weren't overly greasy, and had enough meat to counterbalance the shell. The boiled meats, however, were the real creme de la creme. Served in a butter garlic sauce, each tender piece of meat melted the moment it entered your mouth, delivering an explosion of flavor. Among the other dishes, I thought their Peking duck was cooked perfectly, though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking. Their braised pork cubes and steak bits were also pretty good, though a bit on the fatty side. In terms of drinks, there was nothing too standout, so I'd recommend just sticking to Tiger. All in all, a fantastic dining experience at one of my favorite places in Singapore."

They still serve dim sum at that time. Yay!We ordered the usual char siew so, which is extremely delicate and crispy! It is a must order dish here. Next, came the XO carrot cake, which I heard so much about. It tastes good and the carrot cake is chunky. I think another place which may be better than here or on par is at Chinatown's Spring Court. I honestly, couldn't be bothered with taking photos subsequently cuz the food was just too delicieus to ignore. We had the braised foie gras in blueberry reduction! It is super yummy!!! I would say it is basically foie gras terrine with blueberry jam! Crackling pork belly could be one of the best served in Singapore. I could have a whole plate to myself.

Crispy and crunchy skin with tender flesh and a sliver of fat, not too much, just enough to be justifiable for those counting calories.Whilst most rave about dim sum here (best dish in my humble opnion is mango prawn, not quite the traditional favourite, but the best one for me), I thought their usual fare was more impressive. Winter melon soup was served steaming hot in a hollowed out winter melon, a little corny but may be the reason it tasted better than others. Cod was very well cooked and it made my day that my mango sago came with a trailing smokey stream of dry ice; for only $4.50, I was getting all the fireworks.The restaurant is lavishly decorated, typical of chinese opulence but with just a touch of modernity. It may annoy you that the wait staff continuously stress that you can only stay for 45min/1hr/1.5hr before you have to vacate your table, but service is prompt and attentive, and the quality of food easily makes up for everything else."

They do at least two seatings at lunch.The Carrot Cake is excellent. A re-interpretation of a hawker favourite. And well interpreted, I think. The addition of succulent bean sprouts is so welcome.The roast pork (siew yoke) was recommended to us. It comes in a slab that has been cut down to look like it came out of a factory. It was okay, but for me, nothing remarkable in the way it was done.The roast duck was good, if you like a roast duck that is trying to be a chicken. ie a little too juicy. I prefer duck that is like duck - allowed to be a little drier. But that's just a personal thing. It is very high quality, with crisp skin.Between two roasts, take the duck.There's some mango dim sum thing, fried and with too much mayo. To me, unless you are a huge mayo fan, it was cloying and just too mayo-ey. Why did Singapore ever think mayo and mango is a good combination? Or mayo and prawn? Ugh!There's also a laksa bean curd dim sum dish. It was all right.Chee Cheong Fun also okay.I like that there's an attempt at incorporating local dishes/flavours rather than just offering standard Cantonese dim sum.It's a pity that during the day time the curtains are drawn and you can't see outside. So it feels like it's night time at Ion. And some of the placement of tables is quite awkward."

The spare ribs in sweet sauce is the first dish that comes to mind - caramelised sauce hangs off succulent tender meat that you won't be able to get enough of. The tasty crackling skin of the peking duck wrapped in thin popiah sheets is also probably one of the best I've ever tasted in Singapore. Another must-try would be the perfectly baked cod that simply melts in your mouth.

Food : M and I are fans of the salted egg yolk custard bun! Taste Paradise offers one of the best salted egg yolk buns in Singapore ... my only gripe is that they only offer the steamed version and not the deep fried mantou version at Man Fu Yuan. Their har gau (shrimp dumplings) and siew mai (pork dumplings) are very fresh and well executed. May, the manager of Taste Paradise informs us that they are made fresh every morning. I really liked the prawn mango roll which is encased in a lightly crumbed roll instead of beancurd skin. Mayonnaise is also thoughtfully included in the roll, so it all oozes out nicely in one moreish bite. The char siew sou (puffs) are really quite awesome, good meat to pastry ratio and the latter is light, buttery and flaky. The carrot cake with XO sauce is not bad but I prefer the one at Space @ My Humble House. The steamed beancurd skin with bacon rolls are pretty awesome as well but the wu kok (deep fried yam puffs) don't taste as good as they look. The double boiled soups are also excellent ... very tasty and great for a cold day. The dessert of aloe vera with ice jelly and wolf berries is extremely refreshing too.Ambience : I like how they have private rooms so one can request for them if one chooses not to be caught up in the hustle and bustle in the main dining hall. The layout is a bit labyrinth-like but nice modern Chinese decor with pictures of the different emperors from various dynasties in the private rooms. Service : Prompt, polite and overall perfect. May runs a tight ship and trains her staff well.Will be back for dinner soon!"

In terms of what they offer, it is a blend of dim sum and various Asian Fusion dishes. How this restaurant works is that you wait to be seated, they give you the menu, and then you check off what you want on the smaller paper menu that is sitting at each table. The main menu has a lot of photos so if you're not quite sure what you want to eat it's pretty easy to get a clearer perspective of what that may be.This restaurant can get very crowded, so don't expect the staff to be highly aware of your presence and cater to all of your needs. Meaning, you really have to ask them to come over if you want to get any service. Though, once they get there, they are fairly efficient in doing their job. In terms of interior design, there are numerous tables throughout this restaurant. Many of them are situated very close to one another. Personally, I like a little space when I eat so I can enjoy my meal and my conversation with the person I am dining with. But, due to the fact that Masa's tables are fairly close to one another, you may have somebody sitting elbow-to-elbow with you, depending on where they actually seat you. Just keep this in mind, because this may not be the atmosphere you wish to dine in.Overall, the food here is pretty good and it is an easy place to get to and grab a quick meal."

I visited this location back in March 2017.I love how this was a simple, fast, breakfast place that serves a hearty food. My mom and I ordered and our meal showed up maybe 5 minutes later. I got pre-set menus that came with Kaya toast and a soft boiled egg. Fishball noodle soup. Yum!This place is where locals grab a quick bite to eat before they move on with their day. It's seat yourself but could also end up sharing tables. It's semi outdoor seating so if you're into A/C, this might not be the location for you. I think tissues are 30 cents so remember to bring your own. After you're done, you can walk off your breakfast through the strip of nicely air conditioned malls!"

Before I texted my sis before to go ahead and order first. A bespectacled server came to me, demanded rudely that if I was not planning to eat anything, I must put on a mask. Was she kidding?? Why must she be so rude?? I countered back ""Yea!! I am eating!!"" During Phase 2 after the ""Circuit Breaker"" (aka shelter in place"", everyone in Singapore still needs to wear a mask when they are out and about. People can now dine in restaurants with social distancing procedures in place. Back to that server, why must she used that kind of tone to talk to me, a customer?? Ugh.. again I have to say this.. is it that hard to be polite to paying customers (Reminded me of that rude server at TCC restaurant @ Marina Bay Sands last year) ? Where was her service or manners?? She should simply say this:   ""Hi there! Sorry, if you do not plan to be eating, would you please put on your mask? Thank you for your understanding!""It is NOT that hard!!!!! My sister just asked me to eat whatever she ordered which were already served at the table. I may not kick a big fuss there, I surely not going to let this slide. I would throw hands the next time I visit there. I really wanted to try the soufflé pancake!My mood was ruined but I had to say the seafood pancake was really good! There was also this basket of korean chickens which was not bad either. The ginseng ade was really good!Ambience here is definitely 5 stars. Service was a 0 (the owner should thank their rude staff).

Because of dietary restrictions, I either avoid sandwich shops unless they have a low or no carb option. Although it is not on their menu, Rebel owners Wei Li and Sandy and their team are there to listen to your dietary needs and customize with their products.They listened and surprised me with a huge and delicious bowl packed with vegan and meat proteins, fresh vegetables and avocado. Vegan chicken nuggets are genius. They eerily tasted like chicken in flavor and texture. The tempeh is textuurrific! It has a satisfying bite and chew. I loved eating these with their Nuclear spicy sauce. The omelette perfectly fine cooked, great consistency and taste. I enjoyed their fresh, chunky rich avocado and Vietnamese julienned daikon radish and carrot pickle. This went so went with the chicken patties. The Thai chicken patty had notes that hinted of Thai fishcake. The Vietnamese chicken tastes like the meats in a Banh Mi sandwich. The cilantro brought those flavors together. There are no fillers and icky additives in their patties or other products. They at in the process of getting their restaurant certified halal.I also tried their delicious soups. I had the tomato soup and the mushroom soup. The tomato is good, but the mushroom is divine, the I-CANNOT-STOP-MYSELF divine. They are served with seasoned breadsticks which act as spoons. The reduce the use of disposable silverware. They gave me one because I don't eat bread. Wei Li and Sandy took the time to check on their customers and tell their story.

The portion size for the large is quite generous, and was definitely filling for me. The salmon and salmon belly were both very flavorful and had a nice texture. I wasn't a huge fan of the other fish, but they tasted pretty decent. The ikura was a bit too fishy for me though.- Aburi Kaizen Chirashi Don: This is the same as the Kaizen Chirashi Don, except the fish are all seared a bit. This is more expensive, and I overall felt the regular bowl was better. The searing tastes off a bit too much of the flavor for some of the fish.- Sake Sashimi: 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. Very tasty but was a bit pricey for the portion.Service:No problem with the service, but be prepared to wait if you come at peak times. I came on a weekday and the restaurant was nearly full (with a lot of reserved tables already).Price: $$/$$$The Chirashi Dons were both $26.90, though the normal one was a Large size and the Aburi one was a regular size.

Overall, the service was super quick and food appeared almost instantly.I will join the choir and sing praise for their kaisen chirashi don: it really is as amazing as you read in the reviews (and the reviews of their other location). The fish was amazing, the slices were thick and super fresh. I had trouble finishing the normal size don (granted I had a late and rather big lunch) which is a first!Highly recommended!"

Yes I've heard about this place also having one of the most worth it chirashi sets at a good price. Well... Everyone was right! As seen on Yelp, I went for the popular items right away - the scallop mentaiko carpaccio to share, I had the premium chirashi and my friend being a smaller eater had the normal chirashi. The premium chirashi even came with uni inside with big and plump ikura! Everything was generally very fresh, however the prawn was a bit slimy and strong tasting to be absolutely honest. Everything else was to expectation and a little above, given the great feedback all over the Internet. One thing about this place that really stuck out was their stuff which are aburi-ied (flame torched) ! Anything that they flame torched wasn't just for show. It really does bring out that extra flavour! They seemed like masters at it. Even down to the scallop mentaiko carpaccio! That smokey flavour.... I miss it already!They seem to have a chirashi bowl that is all aburi (torched on one side and raw behind)! I absolutely can't wait to go back and try that! I'm giving this outlet 4.2 out of 5 stars! Would have been slightly higher if it weren't for that lousy prawn! ;)"

Blasphemy, I know!  I find that the food selection here is a lot more extensive than the original. The Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, which in my view, is the STAR dish of this restaurant, is not available at the original location, from what I remember. Second, the Ngee Ann City space is far larger and has much more of a restaurant feel than the hole-in-the-wall experience at the original location. Third, the queue is a tad bit shorter.  In any event, the aburi dishes are the real winners of The Sushi Bar, separateing them from every other sushi restaurant in Singapore. I'm not familiar with the term ""aburi"", but from what I understand, it is essentially grilled/torched raw fish. The Sushi Bar has perfected the art of torching high quality sushi, leaving the edges burnt with the inside nice and raw. Simply, an awesome combination. In short, depending on whether you fancy chirashi or sushi, you should order either the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, Salmon Aburi Roll or both!"

Service, however, is brusque and sullen. The aburi salmon roll they are famous for is flavourful at first bite. The dollops of mayo on top lends it sweetness and creaminess, with a touch of saltiness that accentuates the other flavours. However, once you remove the dollop of mayo on top, the roll itself is extremely average. Though fatty and plump, the salmon itself is not particularly flavourful. The filling of avocado and crab stick and lean maguro don't contribute much in terms of flavour too. So I would say the star of the dish is the mayo! :)  There are better quality sushi options out there at a similar price point."

The gf was craving Chee Cheong Fun and I suddenly thought of this place. Now this is a place that lives up to its name! We went for a standard Char Siew (sweet roasted pork) Cheong fun, a mushroom Cheong Fun, Century Egg And pork porridge and the raw fish. First the raw fish. I love my raw fish. I adore it. I crave for it but this one.... This one disappointed me a little. Not that is wasn't fresh but well;,. Firstly they use a different fish. I believe the regular market/food Centre 鱼生 (raw fish) uses Ikan Parang while this one tasted like snapper fillets. No that I'm complaining about the texture, but what bothered me was the additional Acar. A) I'm not a big fan of Acar to begin with and b) I think the sweetness from the Acar spoils the dish. Gone was that salty, sour (from the lime) 鱼生 dish that I loved. Next came the porridge. What I loved about the porridge here was how thick it was! Unlike the usual ""as-smooth-as-you-can"" style of Cantonese porridge houses, this place likes their porridge chunky and if you're a fan of century egg like we are, you have to do the $1.00 add-on for century eggs. What you'll get in return is a century egg porridge packed with so many pieces that you're guaranteed at least 1 piece egg with every spoon. Next came the 2 Cheong funs. The mushroom Cheong fun was alright. It was a play safe option since we couldn't decide on what to order after the Char Siew. The char Siew on the other hand was really nice. Char Siew wasn't dry and they used a good mix of fat and meat. But what really stood out for both dishes were how soft the Cheong fun itself was! Picking up with chopsticks alone was a challenge and when popped in the mouth, you get this wonderfully light smooth texture that almost melts in your mouth. Definitely one of the best Cheong funs I've had in a while. Overall... This place was worth the short walk in the sun but it could be quite warm if you're lunching there. We'll be back to try their other unique Cheong funs like cheese and lobster and abalone."

I had the boat version since I had no idea what that included and wanted to try something new. Maybe that was my mistake. Nothing special.I do have to admit that the cheung fun was delicious though! The made-to-order rolls were so fresh and tender with a good bite to the rice sheet.  Tried the cha siew and fresh prawn flavors - both good but I enjoyed the latter more.  They had a lot of advertising for their special durian flavored cheung fun but I didn't end up trying it.  I generally like to eat my durian as is and not cooked into anything.Overall an ok place but also a tad more expensive than a usual small shop like this.

The century egg porridge is very average and unremarkable, but I find the chee cheong fun is damn delicious!!

Nope; we're west and north of the target these folks are aiming for. But with a base of good Tex-Mex and some farther south-of-the-border influences, it was just what this culinarily homesick guy needed to restore my faith in civilisation, at least until I get hungry again. That won't be for a while... the portions aren't huge by norteamericano standards, but by Singapore standards generally, they're more than respectable. I was starving when I sat down and decided I really wanted comfort food after all, so I had the beef chimichanga... and could barely finish it. (People who know me, and too many who don't, have heard me complain for years about how stingy most restaurants here are with their portions, unless you're paying four-star-or-higher prices.)Ditto to what others have said about the jalapeños. I haven't had peppers that good in years. Also ditto to what others have said about the service; when we came in in a group of five, the place was at what looked like the end of early-supper rush, and we felt very welcome. Professional, attentive, patient and flexible service very unlike far too many places I've been here the last few years.If you go in expecting authentic Juárez or Tampico-style cooking, you're going to be disappointed. If you think this is going to be a slightly more upscale Chili's with better Tex-Mex, you're close, but in for a (pleasant) surprise. I know I'll be back, and at least 3 of the 4 others in my party (with varying levels of exposure to the cuisine in general) were also enthusiastic.Notice how all the positive reviews are from Americans or Americans-turned-locals and the negative reviews are from born locals (at least as I write this)? If you live here a decade or so, you'll understand; until then, if anybody knows better food for the money, it's news to me."

I will also note that on their site, Viva Mexico claims to be  traditional Mexican food and not Tex-Mex.  While they have some moles, from what I saw of their menu, it is mostly Tex-Mex.  Plus, the fajitas seem to be pretty popular.  They are as Tex-Mex as it gets.My goal was to find a place that served decent US chain (El Toritios, etc..) quality Tex-Mex food.  My mission was a success.  In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is.  This is true from the ambiance to the food.Speaking of the ambiance; it is festive.  Well, it is in the festive get out the decorations for taco night sort of way.  But it sets the mood for having a margarita or two.  And speaking of margarita's theirs are pretty good.  Nothing to write home about, but good enough to keep the Viva Mexico mood going.  It seemed like everyone there was in good spirits and enjoying their meals.  For me, this was a nice plus to the overall ambiance.The staff was friendly, professional, and prompt.  This was maintained throughout our meal.  This even included a moment where the power went out.  But that was only a very minor hiccup.The food was quite good.Nachos - We started with some nachos.  We enjoyed them very much.  I sought out the jalapeños.  My friend did everything she could to eat around them.  The chips were crisp.   The cheese was all melted.  This is all just as it should be.tinyurl.com/bz5eu8nGuacamole - We also ordered a side of guacamole.  This was also very good.  There were lots of fresh ingredients.  They had also insured not to over mix it so there was still some texture.tinyurl.com/aleeo7jFajitas - I ordered chicken.  She ordered beef.  I thought both were good.  I love fajitas.  I love food where you get to do a little bit of combining and playing while eating.  Being her first adventure with fajitas, my friend did not embrace this part as much.  She abandoned the create your own fajita taco and stuck with the fork and knife.  I thought that both the chicken and beef were cooked well.  They were both tender and had nice seasoning.  The veggies were still very crispy.  All in all -  two good sets of fajitas.tinyurl.com/abmcj9qOverall - This was a fun meal.  The food was good.  The service was pleasant.  The ambiance was on the festive side.  Good stuff!  I will be back."

Hell to the no. Is this the best TEXMEX in Singapore? Hell to the YES! I came here on a Friday night with Michelle M. and there was a small band jamming and singing in Spanish! What a perfect way to start our TexMex adventure. We ordered nachos, crab enchiladas, beef burrito, and beef tacos. I didn't try the beef burrito, but the crab enchiladas and beef tacos deserve an ole! The enchilada sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but it definitely tasted like enchilada sauce so me gusta! It didn't taste much different from Chevy's enchiladas, which I faintly recall. Plus, the nice chunks of crab meat gave it a distinctive local flavor. Kind of like chili crab but no need for messy hands or a bowl of lemon water. The tacos are also worth the $17 as the price included 3 soft shelled tacos, rice, refried beans, and a small salad. Not bad considering Lucha Loco charges $11 for just one taco. The refried beans were also delicioso, def. an item I'll order as a side or even as an appetizer. I'm no nacho lover, but Viva Mexico's nachos blew me away. They came with REAL jalapenos! Nice big, fat vinegary ones!   ¡Salud! I was so happy I almost burst into tears...do you know how difficult it is to find jalapenos in Singapore?? My homemade Mexican food just doesn't taste the same without them. Viva Mexico (and Subway, I guess), tell me who your distributor is, por favor! I need them jalapenos! This certainly isn't the best TexMex I've had in my life, but for Singapore, I'm thoroughly impressed. For the price, atmosphere, and food--me encanta!

I will also note that on their site, Viva Mexico claims to be  traditional Mexican food and not Tex-Mex.  While they have some moles, from what I saw of their menu, it is mostly Tex-Mex.  Plus, the fajitas seem to be pretty popular.  They are as Tex-Mex as it gets.My goal was to find a place that served decent US chain (El Toritios, etc..) quality Tex-Mex food.  My mission was a success.  In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is.  This is true from the ambiance to the food.Speaking of the ambiance; it is festive.  Well, it is in the festive get out the decorations for taco night sort of way.  But it sets the mood for having a margarita or two.  And speaking of margarita's theirs are pretty good.  Nothing to write home about, but good enough to keep the Viva Mexico mood going.  It seemed like everyone there was in good spirits and enjoying their meals.  For me, this was a nice plus to the overall ambiance.The staff was friendly, professional, and prompt.  This was maintained throughout our meal.  This even included a moment where the power went out.  But that was only a very minor hiccup.The food was quite good.Nachos - We started with some nachos.  We enjoyed them very much.  I sought out the jalapeños.  My friend did everything she could to eat around them.  The chips were crisp.   The cheese was all melted.  This is all just as it should be.tinyurl.com/bz5eu8nGuacamole - We also ordered a side of guacamole.  This was also very good.  There were lots of fresh ingredients.  They had also insured not to over mix it so there was still some texture.tinyurl.com/aleeo7jFajitas - I ordered chicken.  She ordered beef.  I thought both were good.  I love fajitas.  I love food where you get to do a little bit of combining and playing while eating.  Being her first adventure with fajitas, my friend did not embrace this part as much.  She abandoned the create your own fajita taco and stuck with the fork and knife.  I thought that both the chicken and beef were cooked well.  They were both tender and had nice seasoning.  The veggies were still very crispy.  All in all -  two good sets of fajitas.tinyurl.com/abmcj9qOverall - This was a fun meal.  The food was good.  The service was pleasant.  The ambiance was on the festive side.  Good stuff!  I will be back."

There's everything from Ramen to Sushi, and I think is great for families, because there's always something for everyone. My favorite for sure is AJISAI ramen! This place is quite small, so if you are coming here with 2+ people, I would recommend to first grab a table and then get your food. Another pro tip, is to first get your drinks before ordering the food. All drinks must be purchase from business #1."

Selfish, I know. My love for this joint however, has started to waver a little and in my own twisted way of thinking, I'm hoping if more people patronize the shop because they know about it, they'll tighten up the quality standards and everyone benefits.So why do i like Tsuru-Koshi? It's the only udon specialist restaurant that I know of my side of town (it's sad but true, but that's the crabby restaurant landscape in Singapore). It seems like a classic Japanese restaurant transplant that I imagine had some amount of quality control done by the OCD Japanese owner or his Singaporean equivalent. The noodles have always been cooked on the cusp of al dente and the tempura items fried crisp. Lastly, the prices are decent given where the restaurant is located and the portions for quality.What's wrong now? The restaurant is still by far the only means for me to get remotely Japan-standard udon in Singapore, short of going to one the high end places worthy of a business lunch. This place wouldn't stand out in Japan by any means, but for Singapore, it's great. However, on a visit yesterday, I noticed the cooks have become sloppy. The Asu Asu Tan Tan udon I normally order came in a little mess of a bowl - with the minced meat chucked to one side, the noodles un-artfully dunked in and the soft egg broken. The tempura sides we ordered - pumpkin, ebi and the fish cake tubes - left oily kisses on the tenshi. The latter is a cardinal tempura sin in my book. If I wanted a sloppy fry-up, I'd head to Smith's.So yes, this review is strange in that I am none too pleased about what's happening in the kitchen. But, the udon still beats the competition by far. So do me a favor, stop by and grab a bowl or two regularly and tell them to step it up, please? Or tell me if you know of any worthy alternatives."

I love cold udon in a simple soy sauce with lemon, but this time I opted for the ""hot spicy cold sauce with minced pork"" which was very delicious. My only complaint is that for 9 bucks, I was expecting more noodles. It's a good size for most girls in Singapore I think. And the egg was pretty good.

This is the 2nd K+B location with the first operating for a few months now at Leisure Park Kallang. The owners hope to open many more and franchise it throughout Asia. The pizza are delicious and because I'm a thin-crust fan, this place already has a ""pizza"" my heart. The crust has a little spring & chewiness to it so if you prefer a harder crust, you may not enjoy it as much. The sauce and topping options are very extensive and fresh, but the bacon is superb. Perfect size slices of real side pork, and not that dried baco-bit stuff many other places use.

I think the staff is cordial and efficient. The only difference is they will hand you a hot towel once seated to clean your hands? They also offer aprons and cloth to cover your bags on the chair. As reservations can be made for lunch, we didn't have to wait for a table and make use of their manicure services and fruits refreshment. You are given a tablet to order your food. Somehow ours was set to the Chinese language and unfortunately most of us could not read it and order. Finally a friend who can read it found there was an option to switch to English (upper right corner). They should consider putting ""ENG"" or something when the menu was in Chinese mode and in Chinese characters when in English mode so the monolingual can select the language option. Alternatively you can also flag down a wait staff for assistance. The food is good. Fresh and appetizing and of better quality. I did not expect cod in the seafood platter. The soup is also tasty and the Szechuan spicy soup (mala) is actually drinkable. It did get spicier after a while. Take out the chili to reduce the spice level or ask to top up the soup to dilute the spiciness. The chicken soup is delicious too. I am also surprised the cost is lower than expected. I thought it would be similar to Imperial Treasure Steamboat pricing (about $100+ for 2) but it turned out quite reasonable. Maybe it depends on what we ordered too. For a table of 5 girls, it came to around $140. We had a seafood platter, slice beef, beef balls, mushroom platter and vegetable platter. We did not add the self service free flow seasoning for $4++ each as we did not fancy the desserts or fruits. We were full with what we had, with room for dessert elsewhere.This is a comfortable place for hotpot but it is very crowded and so it is very noisy too. I still prefer to have steamboat at home but I will not mind returning if since reservations can be made. No way will I queue for this though. The usual wait time is about 2 hours or more. Another slightly cheaper option with equally fresh and good food will be Shi Li Fang at Orchard Central and Icon Village."

Many restaurants should take a leaf or two from them to really enhance diners experience. Secondly, their food items are really fresh and appetizing. I would like to specially mention the pork balls. They don't have the porky taste and each bite is QQ and full of flavour! Super win! I usually don't enjoy eating meatballs because so many people kill it for me. Their pork balls is currently my top ranking ones in terms of taste and texture! We chose the herbal black chicken soup base and their signature mala spicy soup base. I requested for really low level of spice as I don't know what to expect. Turned out it still packed quite a punch though it's low spice level. Their chicken soup is white and full of flavour. Even without anything in it, I could have drank bowls and bowls of it already! And to give them credit for using REAL stock, I didn't feel thirsty even after me drinking a lot of soup by the end of the meal. Dessert and condiments counter, we opted for this at an additional $4 per pax but to me, it's really worth it. Not only I can mix my own dipping sauce the way I like it, there is a nice selection of fruits and Chinese desserts. Today, they had rock melon and watermelon which were nice and sweet. As for the Chinese desserts, I enjoyed their chilled Beancurd and white fungus especially. All in all an excellent meal! Totally satisfied and already planning when to return again. Surely a sign of an excellent restaurant!"

Amazed that the waiting time can stretch up to 2-3 hours! But they try to make it less painful by offering free food, drinks, even manicures if you choose to wait. Instead we went window shopping and came back when we anticipated the table might be ready. We still had to wait about 20 mins despite being told our number was next in line. Can kill time by folding paper cranes to redeem a $6 dish haha. After being shown to our seats, we were offered a ziplock bag for our phones, aprons to cover our clothes etc. Thoughtful indeed. Ordered the ingredients we wanted over an ipad, and half portions were available. Our waitress helped us concoct a dipping sauce and also helped cooked some of the ingredients. I even saw her peeling prawns for the next table. Hot towels are also given for us to freshen up. Service indeed is one of the commendable highlights here. So now let's talk about the food. The tomato broth is indeed one of the yummiest soups they have offered. A slight sweetness that goes well with most of the ingredients. Also had the Szechuan mala one which I sometimes mixed with the tomato soup in my own bowl for that wonderful pairing. Appreciated the fresh seafood pastes (prawn, squid etc) and meat balls. At least the more premium pricing is justified by the fresh, non-processed ingredients. Also was treated to live noodle making show. After the yummy steamboat, there are still fresh fruits, sweet chinese tong sui and ice cream if you must have something sweet to end the meal. Pricing was about $50/pax which is a bit high for us tourists, but I think you pay what you get and this is a place definitely worth trying at least once! Go for the 4 soup option then haha. The only thing making me think twice is the waiting time.... but I did hear that they open until 3 or 5 am.... so supper option maybe?"

Everyone knows the service here is top-notch (hot towels, popcorn & herbal tea & fruits & manicures while you wait, ziploc bags for phones, aprons, hairties, etc), but I wouldn't come here if not for the amazing amazing food. For steamboat the broth is paramount and basically defines your meal. And the broth here has been consistently good. I always order the ma la with either the mushroom (they call it San Xian) or black chicken soup. No steamboat restaurant has the same reverence for and focus on the soup: it's served to drink alone with parsley and spring onion before you even add any ingredients, and on its own, it's already so addictive. It comes with ingredients too - actual black chicken, and two types of mushrooms & fishballs for the mushroom one. I am a huge fan of ma la tang, and the one here is tasty in itself, even after I scoop out most of the chili oil. It's actually drinkable !!!The dishes here are also fresh and inventive. You can order half or full portions - we usually order half portions and add on later if we like the dish. My faves: -Noodles - freshly spun and cut at your table. A rather small portion though, so order more if you'd like to enjoy more of this silky soft handmade la mian. -Pork and chives dumplings - YUM. Too many steamboat places are sloppy on their dumplings. The filling is fresh and juicy, while the skin tastes just like mee hoon kueh / like the la mian. Delicious. -Fish glue - my family loves this. It tastes very distinctly of fresh prawn here, compared to other places where it may taste more like fish or fish cake. -Meats like U.S. beef and black pork - thinly sliced and delicious on its own, even cooked in lighter soups like chicken/mushroom soup. The portions are not that large though, so savor them! -Meatballs - none of that tasteless frozen synthetic junk here. Tastes just like fresh meat. I'm also addicted to their chilled beancurd, served along with their sauces and condiments ($4 each). I'd usually balk at paying for this at some other steamboat restaurants but never hesitate at Hai Di Lao: besides the chilled beancurd (which is impossibly fine and soft and light and delicious and I eat maybe 5 portions each time), there're a few traditional cold dishes like peanuts and beancurd skin, fresh and actually very ripe fruits like watermelon and cut oranges, and a ridiculous display of sauces. Tbh I don't know why someone would have Korean gochujang or fermented beancurd sauce with steamboat...but definitely impressive variety. I feel like I need to say something bad about Hai Di Lao after raving for so long...so let me rack my head. Okay, it was a bit of a pain to make reservations because the line is often busy and can't get through. But just keep calling and make them, because you don't want to watch hungrily outside for 2 hours. I've never waited. This usually means I make reservations a few days or a week ahead. Of course Hai Di Lao is pricier than the usual run-of-the-mill steamboat restaurant. Orders of two types of broth already totals to more than $20 for the table. But it's not meant to compete with more casual places - Hai Di Lao offers a relaxed, quieter, more formal ambiance, where you can leisurely cook and sip at your soup and chat while enjoying your meal. IMO that's worth paying for occasionally, and frequently if you can afford it!"

They are pretty known for their service and quality of food. The service staff is generally very courteous and attentive. The usual practice is that after the soup boils, the service staff will offer to pour out some soup and add some gsrnishing for you before you actually cook your food. If you have trouble with the menu they will be more than willing to help you out. Also when you do order prawns, they will check if you'd like them to remove the shells for you and if you would like to have the prawn heads in the soup. I would say that the 313 branch is slightly less crowded and easier to get a table. They now have a new concept of small individual pot as an alternative to having one big pot with 2 separate soups. Price wise, it's slightly higher as they do provide more than just food, free manicure session for the ladies if you have to wait very long for a table and a kids playing area."

Portions are a little on the smaller side, but I'm told the noodles are in a bigger bowl now than a year ago. Wontons are still small, but the portion of brisket and tendon is fairly generous.

The noodle is excellent: very thin and elastic just like in Hong Kong. The deal-breaker for me was its broth which had an excruciatingly pungent aftertaste not dissimilar to foul ammonia smell (i can't remember if it was this bad in Hong Kong). This likely came from lye water used to make the noodles but the odd thing is the noodles tasted perfectly fine until i drank the soup which ruined the dish in one sip. I guess that's the price of admission for springy noodles.Shrimp dumplings, consisting of 1 slice of shrimp and some wood-ear mushrooms loosely packed together in wonton skin, were unimpressive. The bite does not offer sufficient flavor contrast and seemed to be missing a binder and thus fell apart easily upon consumption."

I forgot how the noodle was served in a regular rice bowl. I had the beef brisket with shrimp wanton noodle so the bowl was just slightly bigger. I felt the portion was small but I was not sure if it was because I was used to the bigger bowls served in Crystal Jade and Imperial Treasure. I would say the portion filled me up to 75% full so it was probably good if one wants to eat less or practice eating to 80% fullness. There were 4 wantons which was decent as some places would only give 2-3 wantons when you ordered a mix. The beef brisket could be more tender but it was not bad. The noodles were thin and chewy (Hong Kong style) and the soup was a tad too salty for me. The chili was strange, I would prefer the type served at Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure. I guessed the people has spoken. The noodle did not live up to its hype so there was no queue after 3 months of opening. It was still only half filled close to 12pm."

Broth was tasty, and noodles were well cooked and springy, but had a very strong lye water flavour that I dislike.

Unlike what my mother had commented, the portion was pretty reasonable (not too small). The noodles were stringy and on the side there was oyster sauce that you suppose to stir together with the noodles to increase the flavors. I tried the noodle first. Unlike another store I tried this week, it was pretty well cooked. It wasn't too soft or too hard to chew. The prawn wontons together with the soup were flavorful. Not as salty as I thought it might be.The Luo Han Guo drink was refreshing but I would probably try the other drinks the next time round.

I have to be honest here. I haven't been to Hong Kong in the last 20 years so it's very difficult for me to asses Mak's Noodles authenticity versus their Hong Kong counterpart.What I will do however, is compare it to other wanton noodles found in Singapore, based on either similar style or price range (so yes, no comparing to auntie lim or auntie choo's wanton Mee at xxx Coffee shop). Tossed Noodle with Shrimp Roe and Oyster Sauce. One of their signature dishes here, I found it leaning to the slightly saltier side. While the noodle was beautifully springy or ""Q Q"", the shrimp roe did end up making the dish a tad bit too smart for my liking. Braised Beef Tendon and Brisket Noodle Now this was a dish that I liked... A LOT!While still leaning slightly towards the salty side, the sauce added a great additional depth to the noodles. Coating the noodles with a smooth, rich and really beefy sauce (be warned, it is really really beefy), served with a fairly generous portion of brisket and tendon, this dish will make any meat lover happy! Wanton soupHow could we come to Mak's and not try their signature wantons. First impressions? A generously stuffed wanton!Nothing can be worse than a wonton with really thick skin and minimum ingredients and this wanton is not one of them. Smooth skinned with a really juicy filling, the wanton was a delight to have! Overall..... A very decent wanton restaurant. The noodles are a lot finer to what most people are used to and because of its springiness, might irritate diners by getting caught between the teeth (I should know, I got a few stuck throughout my lunch), but, however, it was still a good Plate of wanton noodles. Queues are managed well and staff are generally friendly. That said.... Is it a Michelin star restaurant? Hmmm maybe the Hong Kong one but certainly not the ones in Singapore and, it is slightly on the higher end of the spectrum when compared to competitors like crystal jade etc, but it's still generally a decent bowl of wanton Mee."

We especially LOVE hotpot BUT the broth here is on another level. We used to go to other location which is in Katong, too, but the broth quality there had gone down the drain. So.. this is the most consistent location we know. And by consistent, I mean that the soup is always of the same quality (never diluted) when it's served (before you added the extra ones from the bottles, of course).The most common broths that people get are the Ma La and Collagen. I personally love the collagen one so much and recommend everyone to order at least that one when they first come to visit. For the Ma La, it's really hot and this place definitely does the kick. There's also a large selection of ingredients to create your own sauces that you can mix n match to dip in your items. My friends usually mix some of the ingredients together for their tangy, spicy or garlicky sauces. In addition, they also provide fruits to end your meal. Some of the drinks are refillable and my favorite is the sweet & sour one.After you finish your meal, they tend to give you a small cup of sweetness to wash down your meal with as (or before) you pay along with free wet tissues. No spoilers, but this is a place to constantly experience especially on a cold day with your loved one; that's my bowl of happiness.On a side note, bookings are required especially on the weekend and there's always 20% OFF from 10:30pm onwards everyday."

Well it is mostly known to the office workers and retail shops people working nearby. So it is hidden only to the tourists and general shoppers in Orchard Road.Most people will flock to the food courts in Orchard Road (not much choices with Food Republic dominating most malls and the ever crowded one at Takashimaya) for cheaper eats. Some may head to Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza for the smaller local food outlets. Then you get this place.It is a staff canteen for Singtel employees working there but somehow it has open its doors to outsiders. It is a Godsend as the food prices are way cheaper than the places named previously. I only learned of its existence after my colleagues brought me there when I started working in the Orchard area. Apparently many construction workers and retail shop staff usually buy the food here as the portion is bigger at the cai fan stall and is relatively cheaper. There are two prices displayed for staff and non-staff. Generally you can get a full meal including a drink for $5 or less. The food is not the best but it is pretty decent.For cheap eats in the premium shopping belt, I'm in!"

The duck leg is cured overnight, slowly simmered for another 10 hours before pan-frying to yield a golden-brown crispy skin, encasing the tender and flavorful meat. Paired with braised red cabbage and sautéed potatoes.Nothing beats a whole pork knuckle to go along with some beer! Eisbein, a traditional German delicacy, features a whole pork knuckle marinated overnight with a special in-house blend, boiled for another hour and then glazed with a coat of apple vinegar to attain a crisp finish. Good for sharing!Have some Asian comfort food with the Dolsot Bibimbap. Mix in the homemade gochujang, a fermented condiment specially concocted by Korean Chef Kim, for a sweet, tangy and subtle chilli kick.The Taste of the World ala carte menu is available daily for both lunch and dinner at The Dining Room.

Very FEW choices, and Very BASIC make...DRINK ORDER offers, on the other hand were constant, and the alcoholic ones came fast.. Real problem with non-alcoholic drinks was that they had no idea what a Lemon, Lime & Bitters was.. Nor a Lime Soda..? We found this a little far-fetched...

Some highlights of the buffet includes an entire ice bar with seafood such as oysters, mussels, shrimps and crayfish. There's also various live stations manned by chefs who'll cut up sashimi, duck and cook pasta for you. The selection of hot food has dishes that ranges from Chinese, Indian, to Mediterranean. Since we went during the CNY period, besides the usual fresh vegetable for your pick of salad mixture, they also had ingredients for the traditional Lo Hei so you can make your own to do your little mixture and enjoy it with your friends/family for a more prosperous year ahead!The dessert bar is also really awesome with a good selection of cakes, tarts, pies and of course, dont forget to ask the chef for a chocolate lava cake! Waiting time is about 5mins so go make your order first, pick up some fruits and marshmallows to dip into the chocolate fondue then go back to collect your cake. To make the lava cake even better, you can add a scoop of ice cream or preserved fruits, whichever suits your palette more! Not into lava cake, you can also ask for a waffle instead.All in all, a really good experience. Yums and cheers to a great year to come!"

I thought the food was pretty yummy and fairly cheap.Be warned though, this place is somewhat similar to a Korean BBQ place in that you may end up coming out smelling of BBQ! Delicious, but perhaps not the best sort of perfume.. Anyway, here on a Sunday afternoon, fairly crowded, seemed to be quite populated with Filipinos. Service was fairly quick - although we did have to wait a little bit for our waters to get refilled.Grilled squid aka Inihaw na Pusit ($14.95) was delicious! Nice sauce and good char-grill taste. Not too chewy, nice bite to it. A bit too charred at some places - we were trying to scrape a bit off (avoid carcinogens.. plus completely burnt bits don't make for the nicest taste either).Bulanglang ($7.45) was pretty good too, hadn't had it before so it was definitely interesting. Mixed vegetables in a rather salty sauce (as long as you don't try to drink the sauce on its own you're fine - just be satisfied with it flavouring/clinging on to the veges!) I liked the eggplant, had a good roasted taste. Other veges include bittergourd (not a fan in general), pumpkin (ok, not that sweet), okra, long beans, some tomato/onion (yum!). Also, four pieces of grilled fish on top had pretty good flavour too!Garlic rice ($1.70) was nice, soft and flavourful; I bet a good amount of oil went in to making it moist/yummy. Haha. Oh well...Pinaputok na cream dory ($11.95) was also delicious! I thought 'cream dory' meant it was going to be creamy so I was a bit wary, but boy was I wrong. This dish came wrapped in a banana leaf (I love foods that are steamed/wrapped in leaves! They are usually scrumptious) and tasted pretty healthy (surprisingly, Filipino food isn't really something I associate with healthy living haha). Steamed veges (tomato/onion/leeks) with tender fish, mmm. Glad my dad picked it!"

Like most restaurants on the Cuppage Terrace, this place is tiny, there is plenty of seating outside but the restaurant itself is small. The food and the flavors are there. I tried the yellow curry and my colleague tried the spicy noodles. The yellow curry was not overpowering, very light, and very authentic. The other dish was spicy and hot yet he couldn't stop eating them it was that good. With such good we had to try the dessert, I wish I remembered the name of clicked a picture. It was the first one on the menu and looks like a sundae except much tastier with coconut milk, brown sugar on the side and green gummies. Again, I am not much of a dessert person, but I couldn't stop myself from finishing. We complimented the owner and chatted with him after dinner. Great conversation. Now to the not so good side of the restaurant. I hate to do this but has to be done. The service is poor. My companion was visually uncomfortable, and we asked for the water several times and the sweet sauce. Yet it took a solid 10 minutes with only one more table occupied in the restaurant. There is no tap water, and the place is expensive about $50+/person. At those prices, I would expect good service and least of all free water.

We chose Thai because we didn't feel like eating much and figured some Tom Yum would work. Service was spot on, but the soup we ordered medium spicy had fire coming out of our ears. It was replaced promptly, and the new ""mild"" version was hotter than the medium we're used to, but acceptable. The broth was tasty, but the high price wasn't justified by the paucity of solid food. Mine was shrimp, and there were just four of those puppies. My husband's chicken was hard to find. Two bowls of soup and nothing else came close to $40 with all the taxes/service charges. It's easy to find cheap food in Singapore, but you gotta stick to street food if you're on any kind of budget. Ginger Thai was okay, but not worth the money."

Food continues to be very special. Very very good. They were short handed this night with a full house. No one was flustered. Only 2 servers. Chef Denis even had to help with service. Nonetheless service was good. A little slow but why rush when you can take your time to savor the meal. This restaurant remains highly recommended. You will not be disappointed food and service wise.

I've been itching to try Singapore's infamous Kaya Toast and luckily, Toast Box was only a few minutes away from my hotel. Not to mention, it was opened bright and early, which was perfect for the jet lagged me. Toast Box is situated at the basement of The Centrepoint and one of the earliest places opened for business in the building. When I got to Toast Box with my boyfriend, there were already a few customers enjoying their breakfast and one person ahead of us. When it was our turn, we told the lady what we wanted but she asked us questions in Mandarin. Unfortunately, our Mandarin is pretty crappy but we used context clues. LOL. My boyfriend saw noodles on the menu so he tried to order that but it wasn't available. Not sure if it's not a breakfast thing or just no longer on the menu. So he got the cheese toast (came with ham and egg on top) while I got the Kaya toast. The lady asked us what drinks we would like with our meals and what type of eggs we wanted with the Kaya Toast. We went with honey tea, milk tea, and soft boiled eggs (came with 2 eggs). The seating area is small but there's more seats and tables outside of the enclosed space! The drinks, Kaya toast, and eggs were ready under 5 minutes. But the cheese w/ ham & egg toast took awhile. Understandable as there was only one lady managing the cash register and one man cooking. My kaya toast was delicious! Crusty on the outside and amazingly sweet and warm inside. The kaya (coconut jam) flavor was very subtle and blended perfectly with the slice of butter that was slightly melting from the warm toast. What surprised me even more were the soft boiled eggs. Omg. How can something so simple taste so addictingly good?! The cheese toast was just alright. Really liked the milk tea too. Comparable to Hong Kong's cha chan tang's. I saw jars of Hainanese kaya being sold by Toast Box for around $5-$6. I was really tempted to buy it but then I found kaya being sold at Cold Storage. It was a supermarket on the same floor as Toast Box. It wasn't the Toast Box brand but it was only $3 so I went with that instead lol."

I meant the restaurant located at the basement level of Sheraton Towers Singapore, not the famous Chinese poet. The cosy restaurant is popularly known for their dim sum but the other Cantonese dishes were stellar as well, which i found out after sampling some dishes from their Chinese New Year menu. Little appetizers were served and we couldn't stop snacking on the candied chestnuts with sesame seeds. The seasoned dried scallops with chili and dried shrimps had me ask for seconds (sans chili oil). I think there's some XO sauce added to it and it's certainly a good seasoning/accompaniment to the mains.Instead of the regular salmon yusheng, we had the Turbot fish, whose name in Chinese means 'many treasures'. There are fried taro and pumpkin slices in the mix, which gave the dish some added crunch.Next, the Braised Superior Bird's Nest with Crabmeat and Crab Roe. I was delighted to see that Li Bai uses birds' nest as a replacement for shark's fin. Well at least bird's nest can be sustainably farmed so it's the lesser of two evils. I liked the clean and light taste of the birds nest (Li Bai was extremely generous with the bird's nest), which was served with a copious amount of crab roe. Ask for the XO sauce, we heard from the PR girls that it's great with the soup. Next, the Lobster done two ways: Salted Egg Lobster and Sautéed fillet of lobster with greens. Surprisingly, I preferred the sautéed fillet even though anything served with salted egg is faultless. The sweetness of the crustacean could be tasted better with the ginger garlic sauce. The texture was superb as well, with the meat being springy instead of chewy. Stewed ""Eight Treasures"" Chicken with South African 5-head Abalone and Sea Cucumber is the perfect dish to be eaten with a bucket of fragrant steamed rice. Much effort has gone into the preparation of the chicken, which was first stuffed with chestnut, mushrooms, barley, lotus seed etc, then fried and browned, before stewing it for 2 hours to achieve that fall-off-the-bone quality. Abalone was briny sweet and tender too. We ended dinner with traditional Chinese desserts with a twist. This Pan-fried Nian Gao had coconut in it and was more like the Malay kueh. The Water Chestnut Cake hearts were a refreshing end to the dinner as well. Li Bai will be serving 9 reunion set menus that caters to various group sizes from 17 Jan to 24 Feb 2014. Do make a reservation in advance to prevent disappointment!Li Bai is certainly a Chinese restaurant that I will keep coming back to. Great service, environment and food. Mums will definitely love this one!"

Unfortunately after being diagnosed with kidney issues, me eating out has become a luxury and finding food that I'm able to eat has been difficult. However, we did decide to give this chicken rice place a go, with the hope that the food isn't too salty. --------------------------------------------------I love it when places exceed my expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by Roost. I happened to see Channel News Asia (of all places), feature this fairly new restaurant at Centrepoint because of the iKook, a patented machine they invented that supposedly cooks the perfect chicken rice chicken. So we figured, let's give it a shot to see how good it is. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical at first. Special machine, Chicken Rice, in the middle of town, sounds a lot like a tourist trap. However, after eating, I was left.... pretty impressed! Yin Yang Platter ($8.90) As a first timer, we had to try both their chickens and the Yin Yang Platter was the way to go. The portion was pretty decent and I have to say, I was pretty impressed by the chicken. Because of the way it's cooked, the skin remains beautiful smooth and gelatinous, Yet, giving that little crunch (or bounce?) when biting into it. The flavor is fairly light (good for someone like me who can only have very minimal salt now) but the taste of the pure chicken really shines through. It's so good that I could have done without the sauce they drizzled over. Again, do take note that I've been on a no salt / minimal salt (like 120mg max) for the last 2.5 months so my tastebuds do tend to differ from someone who regularly eats out everyday. The rice was pretty decent too, a little like Loy Kee's but less oily. Soup was, well a chicken soup, but I could taste a bit of herbal-ness in the soup, which was a nice touch. The ginger was interesting, being a little sweeter than usual and the chilli. Oh the chilli was good. It was a little sweet when you first taste it, before the sour suddenly kicks in and than the spice. Ipoh Kway Teow Soup ($7.90)This was pretty good too. The soup is light, yet very tasty and the thin Ipoh Kway Teow was cooked to perfection. The flavors were very balanced and the chilli it came with gave a real kick. A good pairing with the portion of white chicken. Chicken Sushi ($4.90)Now this was interesting. I expected the rice to be the same as the one served with chicken rice, but it wasn't! It was chicken rice + more. The addition of fries garlic and shallots, along with the oil, not only help bind the rice into sushi form, but it packed a lot of extra flavor and aroma into the rice.Topped with a very very tender piece of chicken (although I wised it was bigger), drizzled with their sauce and topped with shredded, stringy, fried ginger (that was a nice touch), the chicken sushi might sound gimmicky but it was so so so good. On a whole, I do think the chicken rice here is pretty good. It definitely ranks higher than Tian Tian in my books, and it's a good way to experience chicken rice in a comfortable, air conditioned environment, without paying a chatterbox prices. Considering that they're the new kid on the block, I really hope they survive."

Even though I do love sashimi, I decided to go with an oyako don as I hadn't had a good bowl of oyako don since my last japanese trip!1. Oyako Don $10++For $10++, I was surprised to see such a huge serving. The japanese rice was definitely quality japanese rice. You could taste the fragrance of the rice. The rice also quickly absorbed all the sauces from the omelette and the chicken making it extremely flavourful. I could totally eat a whole bowl of this rice on its own!They were extremely generous with the numerous cubs of juicy and tender chicken meat that was doused in the sweet teriyaki mixture. Served together with the don, is a miso soup which a tad too salty for my liking, but I happily fished out and ate the seaweed. Alongside, you will also get some watermelon slices.2. Ikura Chawanmushi $8++I decided to treat myself with an Ikura Chawanmushi. I love ikura and I love this even more as the Ikura was super fresh and almost melts in your mouth. The chawanmushi was steamed to perfection. It was almost like eating a pudding, a baby with no teeth would have no problem eating this. The steamed egg had a mousse-like textuyre yet withholding the characteristic notes of the egg, prawn and mushroom flavours.I'm definitely ordering this again!Overall : great quality japanese food in a cosy setting. I do hope they settle smoothly in their new location in Tanjogn Pagar and I cannot wait for my next dining experience in Kaiware.Take note : Kaiware is moving to 22 Cross Street #01-50/53 China Square Central Singapore 048423 on July 2016. Reservation contact number 6735 2345 will remain the same."

We got bunch of stuff to try, sated egg York wings, two way Chinese broccoli (half is steam and the other half was fried minced broccoli leaf...OMG, must have) and black pepper shrimp which was ok. You can get either noodles or rice with the meats. We all got noodles and the sauces/chili comes with it is pretty good.

The char siew is good. Chunky and all for the good ones. It's just that for my bowl, there were quite a few pieces with just fat and no lean meat in it. Mind you, I am not even talking about the siew-yok(roasted prok) here. I like that the bowl had some pickled cucumbers as a nice touch to warrant $9.90 but the char siew parts that I got were too fatty.Yes fat is taste but too much fat, especially in chinese cooking, equals oily equals un-stomach-able. My appetite is gone.People order char siew more for lean meat dare I might say. The fatty part could be there minimally. Dare I also might say, that fat cannot be glorified in char siew as if in a chu-toro or o-toro because those weren't as oily as char siew. So stop marketing it that way! The char siew needs to be more refined. I have tasted better in hawker centres.Talk about the roast pork, there is crispiness in it yes. But the crackle wasn't that crispy also. Dark sweet sauce could be provided for pairing. The mee pok noodles were cooked al dente, no complaints. The salted egg chicken wings got cold very quickly. The wings weren't as crispy and fresh as expected, the sauce becomes gooey quickly. A better way needs be come up with to present it other than this usual style.Thought of ordering the platter but the price of rice is $1.50! Also actually, I prefer white rice over chicken-flavoured rice for my char siew rice. That may be why I find it too oily.This place does hold so much potential. It could be a like a fook kin club of roasted delights. The sauce of the char siew is really good, but there needs to be added twist to warrant the price and make the dish more palatable.Long story short this place has got good vibes and respectable food, but it might not have enough to lure me back a second time."

After the multiple media reviews I had high hopes for this place. Alas! My hopes were dashed. While the food here isn't awful, it wasn't great either.We had the cold tofu starter and deep fried baby squid to start with. The tofu was strange with chopped century egg, some salted egg (sic?) and some ikura on top. I felt that it didn't go well altogether. The baby squid was fried to crispness and no complaints about that. This place's staple is the roast platter, and both char siew and roast pork were lacking in fat, making them a little dry. I suppose the fat proportion of a cut is highly subjective, and dependent on luck, but we didn't think highly of it. The noodles were not bad; springy. It did lack some seasoning which were easily remedied with some garlic chilli. However, it could have done with some pork lard (they should have it on all the tables). Would I return? I'm not sure."

But of course, this world's largest Tonkatsu chain do have restaurants in Tokyo, mostly in major shopping malls or department stores. To celebrate the opening of its new outlet in  313@Somerset, Saboten introduces the Iberico Loin Katsu and Fried Jumbo Prawn that are exclusive to this outlet.Iberico pork, which is famed for its refine marbling and tender texture, was not an easier cutlet to handle than the original katsu. Not as rich or oozing juices as you may find elsewhere, the trimmings were rather leathery, and some effort was required to disintegrate the protein. This in particular, is what polarizes opinions.The Fried Prawn Jumbo Set ($28.80) featuring a wild-catch Tiger prawn, crab croquette and original loin cutlet, is more likely to appease the finicky palates with a mixture of seafood and pork. The coating of breadcrumbs for this set of ingredients was also more consistently golden, light and not cloyingly oily. It would be a pity not to try the deep-fried scallops (2 for $12), especially when they are at their freshest and best condition this time of the year. The Hotate Feast is a new seasonal promotion that runs till end Oct.Good to know: there are also Grilled Chicken Set ($18) and Grilled Salmon Set ($21) for those who prefer non-fried food. Yuzu and Goma dressing are imported from Japan. The Tonkatsu Sauce is developed in-house with more than 10 types of ingredients.All the sets are complete with chawanmushi, pickles and yuzu sorbet, not forgetting the free refills of crunchy cabbage, Japan-imported rice, miso soup, that complete the teishoku experience. As usual, you proceed with the old but obligatory ritual of grinding the sesame before adding the Tonkatsu sauce. But what surprises me is that there is also radish and even curry sauces, which I view as privileges that one can't get in Japan--it is usually katsu with one and only one type of dressing. This may not be the place for the impeccable classic tonkatsu but you can still discover some reliable deep-fried gems, if you pick the right ones"

My suggestion is, if you are only dining with one other person, be sure to ask for a full table because they do have smaller tables along the wall. But, those tables are packed in there pretty tight. From this, you won't really be able to enjoy your conversation and your meal as you may very well have somebody you don't know sitting right next to you. And, I mean right next to you. This restaurant also offers live acoustic music on various nights of the week. The performers all seem to be pretty good and what they provide is covers of some well-known tunes.

So when I asked for a new beer because a fly had landed in it they brought me a partially poorer beer that was missing the orange. So I asked if I could get another orange slice like my last beer. Unfortunately this restaurant has a fly problem cause another fly landed in my second beer. They brought me a new beer and this time they told me this would be the last beer. To that I said yes please and remove this beer as it's not my problem you have flys in your restaurant. To this they said it wasn't their problem either? This seems odd to me as I'm used to if restaurants have a bug or rodent problem they actually do need to take some kind of action to correct it. You'll never guess next they explain that they had sat us at a six person table and because a party of six has shown up they would like to move us to the hall way seating.

This is one of those situations where you think, ""I get what you're trying to do, but how do I say this nicely? No.""I get that this is a trendy place; their dark and sexy interior communicates this well. We arrived on a weekday evening, and most of the tables inside were already reserved. We ended up sitting outside, which wasn't bad as they still made efforts to decorate this area and create an ambiance. The food sounded promising, and there was a lot to choose from. I almost want to say that they're a little confused, as their signboard mentions modern Italian/pizzeria even though there is page after page of Asian inspired tapas and dishes.We ordered a Caprese salad and their Morning After Pizza, which includes a fried egg in the middle. The Caprese salad was amazing. All the ingredients were fresh, and I still remember the beautiful texture and saltiness of the proscuitto. Unfortunately, the Morning After Pizza fell very flat. We couldn't taste anything, which was surprising considering all the toppings that were on there- the roasted mushrooms, the egg, the minced parsley, the melted cheese. Maybe it was the tomato sauce- perhaps it needed more salt? For a place that has ""pizzeria"" on their signboard, this concerns me greatly. I leave my review at 3 stars because they have the ambiance down, and it seems like a great spot for tea or some snacks. I wouldn't say I'd avoid this place completely, but for pizza in this type of setting and for those prices, you'll find me at Extra Virgin instead."

A pretty face. No substance, no umpty-ump.Back to the review, on the surface, Supply & Demand has really got it going on. Beautiful interior, great atmosphere, good looking people, modern ambience. We started off with the Caprese Salad and it was sublime. The tomato, Caprese and rocket, I mean arugula... doused with olive oil is a must have.  Our second dish was the Morning After Pizza. A tomato based mushroom, bacon pizza topped with soft egg. It tasted like Card Board. Ok that's harsh, but really with all those toppings lumped together, how could it be that bad... We may have gotten a bad batch, but it's as if the pizza was pre-cooked, refrigerated, heated and then served. The soft egg was not even center, so the lucky person who got that slice was the only one who had a chance to taste it.In short, Supply & Demand is my Adriana Lima.

Of course there was plenty of vegetarian fare to be found in Little India.. but if I wanted Indian food all week I would have just gone to India.That being said, there was not a huge selection of vegetarian items at Supply and Demand but the kitchen was very accommodating towards our needs and modified pastas and pizzas on the menu accordingly. We really appreciated that the kitchen was willing to add in extra veggies as needed instead of subtracting the meat yet still charging $22 for some tomato sauce and mozz.I LOVED the decor at Supply and Demand! The space imbues an industrial aesthetic in the form of concrete floors, reclaimed wood tables, and exposed ceiling beams and pipes. The dim lighting completed the urban feel of this trendy eatery. It seems to be a pretty popular place as we had to wait about an hour to be seated (at 8 pm) and as we dined there seemed to be an endless flow of patrons. The crowd was predominantly people in their late 20s-30s sans children; I'd assume this means the late night scene at the rooftop bar is pretty fun.Overall, a very pleasant experience and I definitely recommend Supply and Demand to any vegetarians seeking a meal with Western hemisphere flavors!"

Don't get me wrong. It is not entirely quiet (as in no customer) kinda quiet but it's the certain ""zen"" that it exudes the minute I stepped in to this restaurant. First off -  no queue. And second - price is reasonable. And third - good food. Go straight to the superstar when you order - Pork Gyoza either panfried or boil, depending what you fancy. If you want something other than pork, the Prawn gyoza is a good choice too. Besides gyoza, the waitress would recommend you an in house special called jia jia men, a noodle dish which is pretty similiar with the taiwanese version (jia xiang mien). I dont like it as i felt it lacked of taste but found myself ordering my last two recent visits. (i have no hope, i know). Upon serving you jiajia men, the waitress will tell you to mix everything in the bowl and once you're done eating half portion of the noodle, she will then add in ""hot soup"" to it and a half boiled egg into the soup. So for the price of one, you get to enjoy the dry version and then the soup version. Selling at $6.50 per portion, I thought it's a pretty good deal. If you;re still not full, the garlic fried rice and the Nikujyaga (braised beef in stock, i think) are pretty decent. I would def come back from time to time."

I am usually not a fan of gyoza as it is usually sticky, mushy or has a thick layer of dough.I am pretty much blown away with the gyoza here. The dumpling is nicely crisped on one side. The skin is very thin so you do have to deal with chewing through to reach the filling. I had the pork gyoza so the meat was moist and very juicy. Dip it into the sauce and topped with ginger and you have a winner. There are 3 types of fillings now - pork, vegetables and prawns.I also tried the jyajya  men. I was curious about it as there was an instruction sheet on each table on how to enjoy it to its maximum. It was basically chewy noodles with miso paste, minced meat and green onions. Add vinegar and chili oil (or chili flakes) to taste. I found that to be a bit on the bland side, maybe I did not add enough  seasoning. Halfway through the noodles, you could add the soft boiled egg (the server would bring it over when you tell them you wish to have the egg), more miso paste and a bit of the noodle water to have a soupy eggy noodle. This was much better as the additional miso paste did give more taste to the noodle. The highlight is still the gyoza. Order a plate or three. It is that good. The pan-fried version that is."

The skin was thin and crispy and the filling tasty and balanced. I also had the boiled crab gyoza and while they were really nice, I still preferred the fried pork ones but this might just be personal preference.A nice plus is their condiments: they have a range of condiments (including sliced ginger - my fave)  on the table so you can mix your own dipping sauce (in my case: heaps and heaps of ginger with black vinegar and a dash of chili oil).

Having opened at the old Heeren since last year, it has introduced new items to meet the ever-changing consumers' tastebuds. One of my favourites picks was the all-new Crab Gyoza $7.80, an interesting and flavourful twist to the traditional meat filling. Made with fresh crab instead of frozen crab meat, each dumpling is wrapped with the exact same amount of filling, churned and measured to perfection by the machine.The other new dish is the Tonkatsu Udon ($6.80). The creamy broth tasted like Ban Mian Soup--light but no less oily than a Tonkotsu ramen. The ""udon"" belongs to the flatter Kishimen Udon that is popular in Iwate prefecture. It resembles Ban Mian, but softer in texture.Pan fried food tends to win over steamed or boiled ones because they have the extra fragrant burnt aroma. But hey, the Boiled Pork Gyozas($4.80) are not too bad either. Succulent and well-seasoned, the skin is just slightly thicker thus chewier than Xiao Long Bao. I thought the chefs were pretty clever to drizzle them in sweet miso sauce. Too much meat? There is always the Vegetable Pan Fried Gyozas($4.80), just as freshly made like their gyoza siblings.  If you like unfiltered sake, this is one of the places in Singapore that actually imports this premium brew from Japan.Gyoza-ya also prides itself as being the first to serve this Jya Jya Men($6.50) in Singapore. Not to be confused with the typical Chinese or Korean bean paste noodles, Jya Jya Men is an Iwate prefecture delicacy that ranks together with Wanko Soba and Rei Men (Cold Noodles) as Morioka's Top three Noodles.What's the difference? The noodles and the way of eating. Either Kishimen aka flat udon (same as the Tonkatsu Udon) or the usual thick udon, are topped with Minced Meat Miso & Cucumber and eaten with chilli oil and vinegar. After emptying the noodles, the staff will add a soft-boiled egg, more miso minced meat and some boiling water that was used to cooked the udon. Stir everything and you'll get this greyish broth. Doesn't taste as rich as it looks but neither is it as slurpy as ramen broth. I loved the Yaki Azuki Gyoza out of all and felt that it needn't be eaten as desserts towards the end of the meal. Sweet red bean mash encased in thin, crisp shell that reminded me of my all-time love, the Croissant Taiyaki. Never mind if there isn't any butter since they're probably healthier. Matcha, Sesame and Yuzu Ice Cream ($6 each) imported from Hokkaido are also wonderful sweet endings, though the red beans were undercooked. The biggest draw factor is the price. With the gyozas at an average $4.80 for 5 pieces and other food not exceeding $7, it's possibly one of the best deals for Japanese food in Orchard."

I tried to make myself available but every time I'm ready, something caught up. It's kinda sad when I am away from home most of the time with very brief period each time when I return from abroad. But I know I can't find excuse not to visit this time in Jan when I schedule my unplanned return to SG. I have been eating dumplings in Australia and they were mostly made by the mainland Chinese who flock the country of late. But I wasn't expecting the same at Gyoza-Ya, simply that I have read reviews from reputable accolades and I know they are one of my trusted source. I reached the humble outlet prior the dinner crowd: the time reads 6.15pm. There's ample tables to go around for 4s but 2s were almost taken up. The wait staff was polite and obliging to give me a table near the corner of the restaurant when I turned down his offer on the small table next to the entrance, neither a bar counter seat is welcoming, I told myself. I was given a small slip of order list that spells what the restaurant offers. Quite extensive given the size of the humble eating place. The service was very prompt and attentive. My Yuzu Cha arrived quickly and order was taken attentively. I was such a glutton that I ticked so many dishes that they seems to battle for table space when they arrived.  The soup udon was so flavorful that I can't bear to let them drained any unconsumed broth into the sink! The thick slab of char siew was equally good!! Tender and very well marinated, a good layer of lean plus fats goes so well. The JyaJya Men on the contrary didn't fare that well, perhaps the miso wasn't as robust. On average, the udon has a good chewy texture but still, I prefer the round udon to flat udon, the latter has a tougher bite. Gyoza-Ya serves only flat udon. Red king crab dumplings are a must eat. At $7.50, I got 5 plump gyoza filled with juicy minced crab meat, it's a premium dish in affordable price I must say. I like my dumplings boiled every time I had gyoza, even when I had them abroad. The pan fried pork dumplings were excellent too! Not greasy and there's a faint sweetness from the chopped cabbage mixed in the minced pork. The fried soft bone chicken chunks was crisp and addictive. I like the fried batter coating, it taste like the prized crunchy batter bits from long john silver fast food chain! Salty but a delightful way! It's a hate it or love it dish if u don't mind eating soft cartilage. What I least like was the tofu topped with minced beef, the seasoning in the beef just taste weird which I find no words in describing. I'm sorry. But the tofu has a silky texture. I'm glad to have made the trip tonight. Now, I can strike one restaurant out of my to-eat list that goes on and on whenever I leave my home base. Gyoza-Ya, indeed an inexpensive dumpling house that every foodies should at least try once. YUM!!"

The noodles were smooth and delicate but slightly bland even with the goma sauce. I suppose the point was to appreciate the texture of the noodles. Meanwhile the teriyaki chicken was a little too sweet and sour, and didn't really taste like teriyaki at all. Indeed it was kind of like shredded jerky.Gyoza is what this place specialises in. The gyoza were bigger than at other places and the skin was smooth and not overly-thick like at some places. However the gyoza were not sealed so the meatballs inside fell out sometimes. Also the taste of the pork inside was a little odd. The gyoza sauce here seems to be a mix of, among other things, soy sauce, vinegar, oil and sugar. This compares to vinegar at many other places.We also had 2 types of noodles: jyajya men and tonkotsu udon. Jyajya men is like the Japanese version of Chinese zhajiang mian - noodles with a black meat sauce on top. Unfortunately these noodles were rather bland - more sauce was needed, and the sauce wasn't all that fragrant in the first place. It got even worse when, as recommended, I cracked in a soft boiled egg, added some sauce and hot water - it was even more bland. The tonkotsu udon was much better, being served in a rich meat broth.We also had seafood fried rice since the portions were quite small. It wasn't bad as far as Japanese fried rice goes (I think because they fry it on a grill instead of a wok it doesn't have much wok hei [smokiness of the wok] that Chinese fried rice has), but there was hardly any seafood inside. And yes, the portion was small to.The individual dishes are cheap but they add up to more than you'd expect! With two cups of green tea it added up to $40.60."

OMG, Gyoza-ya, where have thou been all my life?The Yaki Buta Gyoza, aka the pan-fried pork Gyoza, is a MUST must must order. I already had high expectation from all the rave reviews on yelp, but I was not disappointed. The thinness of the gyoza skin, the perfect sear, the delicious minced pork that went so well with the vinegar sauce - just blew my mind. It's the absolute star of this restaurant. In fact, next time I wouldn't bother ordering anything else and just order multiple servings of this.It's 5 pieces per serving by the way. I think i can easy eat 20 of these by myself.However since I had to meet the $25 delivery order limit, I ordered other stuff too. Namely:Sui Buta Gyoza (boiled pork dumpling) - meh. Maybe bc it was delivered, i find that the thinness of the gyoza skin, which is what made the pan fried version so amazing, does not transfer over to the boiled version. Also not a fan of the sweet sauce that they douse all over it. I may have liked it more without the sauce.The garlic egg fried rice - this was much talked about on yelp so I gave it a try. And... I mean, it's good, but just like garlic fried rice in other japanese places.Broccoli aburi - meh. This was a weird deep fried(?) broccoli with bonito(?) flakes on top. Not really a fan.Ramen egg - i only needed another $2 to get to $25 so I threw this in. It was a good ramen egg, but it's what you should expect in other japanese places as well."

The chicken rendang is definitely one of the better ones around as the chicken is still moist and not hard and dry. I do like the decor with its posters of Marilyn Monroe and other famous stars of the yesteryear.

What I remember to be the most outstanding is the beef rendang, with a perfect balance of spices forming an amazingly fragrant dish. Other recommended dishes include sayur lodeh, tauhu telor, and tapioca plant. For the brave-hearted, you can try the ox tongue, which has an acquired taste and texture and definitely does not appeal to everyone. Those with a low tolerance for hot and fiery fare will be up for a challenge, seeing that they are that generous with their spices. However, just eat the dishes with the generous portion of steam rice served and there should not be a problem."

There is only one thing I liked here, ie service. One word summed up the whole experience: meh!FOOD 3/5Despite the layout to give an impression the range of food was extremely extensive, the food was mediocre at best. Nothing really stood up, nothing to rave about. It was disturbingly mediocre for the price and venue of this lunch buffet. To me, they are just lousy calories I was consuming. AMBIENCE 2/5The tables and chairs were arranged so close to each other. It was like a dining hall in a college but those tables and chairs in my college were not even that close. It was a pain to walk between chairs at different tables. And mind you I am not even that broad. I had to be careful not to bump onto any chairs on both my sides. Also, I find some of the patrons Triple Three attracted were .. how should I put it nicely? Hmmm.. ok there is no way but to be blatantly honest here, the word is ""selfish"". I witnessed some patrons would took all the pan fried salmon after the chef cooked a batch of them and placed in the tray.  Clearly there was a line behind. These people were those who would go to any buffet and displayed their lack of etiquette and wanted to make sure their consumption was worth every penny they spent. SERVICE 5/5The staff who took care of our table was really friendly and attentive. She would clear our plates promptly and refilled our water. Moving forward, I would not even eat here for free. Even a top notch service would not move me. It is such a pity. Sorry, but not really.Triple Three = 3 3 3 = 9/3 = 3 Stars :PA little update: My brother just told me what was the cost per pax for lunch buffet at Triple 3, almost S$100 including tax per person!!

The food was okay, but it was hard to get food. Instead of laying things out, Triple 3 prefers to have their staff serve you, so that creates lines all over the place. For instance, they cut your sashimi to order, so that takes a little longer. Or the snake of people in line for naan, which blocks off most of the indian food area. The pasta station only had one burner, so it was also a wait for pasta. There was also a line at the tempura station, and the tepanyaki station. I have never been to a buffet that required so much waiting in line. I think this is a big issue, and I won't be back because of it. The lines die down towards the second half of the meal service, but that means I have less time to eat.In terms of quality of food, the salmon sashimi was okay, but the swordfish was very watery. The tempura was well done, light and crispy. The pasta was okay. The meats were not very flavorful. Despite being offered a variety of food, I found my plate constantly filled with the same items, usually items that don't require me standing in line. There was a one-for-one special if you use a POSB/DBS card, so we took that offer. They actually didn't bother to verify that we had the card before giving us the bill. I think the buffet was meant to be cheaper...please don't ever pay the full price for this. For $78++, you can do a lot better."

My favourite, however, is the outstanding tempura live station where the batter is as good as it gets. I hardly finished sampling the entire spread given over 8 counters to choose from, every culinary station hardly disappointed. the roast and indian are highlights done rather well at a buffet where I would have expected less given the quantity. But here there's no compromise on quality too. If you love seafood like I do, the crab legs and succulent prawns, are juicy and sweet with a fresh ocean savouriness rather than a stale fishy taste that I've had at other buffets.Kudos to a great buffet spot,  but it's always packed, so do book early!"

It may only be cabbage, but the freshness, crispness and sweetness of the cabbage helps cut down the oil in the Tonkatsu, making it easier to finish. The soup that comes with it is perfect as well. These aren't simple bowls of pre-mixed miso soup as well. Made with carrots, Radish (daikon) and pieces of pork, these little bowl of soups are stars of their own, helping ensure the sweetness of the cabbage and its sesame sauce, doesn't over power the pork loin, allowing its umami-ness to shine through. To ensure that we don't over eat or overload ourselves, we tend to order a Jumbo Ruso set with an additional rice set ($4.00) to share, which is more than enough for us. Overall, we really love the restaurant and really can't find any fault with it. Simply love the Tonkatsu here and still our go to place whenever we have the craving for it!"

The place is nice, good sevice and quite similar to a Tonkatsu-ya in Japan, food is not exactly cheap.I loved the miso, tsukemono, brown rice choice and all the sauces. Shame for the main thing, which is the tonkatsu, it wasn't all that great, quite dry despite me ordering the Kurobuta Hire which is meant to be the best pork that they have on offer.ALl in all I have had better, but it's a decent option if you are in the area and really want to eat Tonkatsu."

Can't say I'd eat here often or even come back again, but I felt pretty satisfied after polishing off my set meal. The restaurant was half empty(full) when we walked in around at almost 9pm on a Friday evening. They had a ""MisoKatsu Fair"" special at the time: sizzling negi miso rosu katsu set (pork loin with negi miso sauce and egg) for ~S$24++. Pork fillet went for a dollar more. FYI pork fillet is also known as tenderloin and is the leanest of all cuts, so it's a healthier choice. My friend got the pork fillet, and it was less flavorful in my opinion. The chefs cook the meat in a open kitchen right in front of the bar, so you can see the marbling of the meat before they fry it up. To be honest, I expected the pork to be cooked with a bit more skill or technique. Although the meat was very high quality, the end result was just like another fried piece of meat. The sizzling platter was a nice touch as it kept the food warm, but it wasn't a testament to the cooking. The side dishes were nice, but nothing spectacular or unique.After adding on a chocolate cake dessert (just for good measure), the damage came up to about S$35. Glad I tried it, but not willing to pay this much again for some fried pork cutlet."

They give you a scoop of rice, japanese cabbage salad both with unlimited serving and a small bowl of miso soup. I get that they serve many types of pork but the quality just isn't there. I have had much better tonkatsu elsewhere. I was really disappointed with my dish. Since you can't go wrong with rice and cabbage, my grief is with the other items on the plate. I had the mangalica rosu katsu and guess what, the meat was stale, not crispy, not tasty, and jerky. Other people who think this place has the best tonkatsu either they haven't had real good ones or I was just unlucky to be facing a gruesome experience here. It's really a nightmare for me. The cashier was nice though. On the side note, you may want to put the sauce on the side, because your tonkatsu might get soggy by the end."

I loved it. Well, I also haven't been to Tonkichi in a really long time and that used to be my go-to place for gd tonkatsu, but my bro said this place won over Tonkichi when he went on a tonkatsu hunt with his gf. Anyway, I don't like very fatty cuts of meat, so I went for hire-katsu and it was deliciously juicy! As other reviewers have mentioned, the tonkatsu tasted really light and not soaked in oil as is typical of not-so-good places. It was amazing and made me very happy. I got the 120g portion, which actually didn't look like very much but was pretty filling. $22.80++The tonjiru soup, pickles, and cabbage are all free flow. Soup was delicious! And had a ton of ingredients.. Very comforting and brothy and hearty. Cabbage dressing was also very good, went well with cabbage. OH, big plus for being able to get brown rice! I LOVE brown rice. and at no extra charge. Makes me even happier :)Only thing is that I like Tonkichi's actual sesame seed grinder (sort of like mortar and pestle) as opposed to Ma Maison's plastic container thing that effectively does the same thing. Oh! But Ma Maison had both spicy and sweet tonkatsu sauce, never had the spicy one before. Pretty interesting. Liked both of them!Orange jelly that came after the meal was really strange and artificial tasting though, skip that.. Service was okay, took a while to get anyone's attention, I suppose things were getting busy on a Thursday night. It took a while for them to give us warm water and I had to keep asking for more though."

Ok, take this as you will, I'm from nyc and obviously not from Japan, so my opinion might be a bit skewed, but still very much honest. I have had tonkatsu many times in nyc/nj but at ma maison, it was the best I've ever had. The service was great, super friendly and very helpful. It's hard to find good service like that here so it was really refreshing to see that again since I left America. The miso beer and sweet potato sochu...awesome! My boyfriend ordered the black pig tonkatsu and he wasn't impressed. The meat was tough, and I'm not sure if its because it might have been a little overlooked or maybe that's just how the texture is naturally. I actually enjoyed his dish. Yes, it was a bit tough and chewy, but it was still juicy and flavorful. I had the tonkatsu fillet and, again, the bomb! That dark sauce is salty and flavorful, plus the nice shredded PILE of cabbage. The sticky brown rice was also fantastic. It was nutty and hearty, just awesome. I want to find out how to make that, because I can get used to that kind of brown rice! Not cheap though. 2 drinks and 2 meals was $100. Thank god the food was good."

When my craving for katsudon hit me last week, I made the rare special trip to orchard on a weekday to have some katsudon and was sorely disappointed. I'll cut to the chase. The service was appalling. I understand being rushed and busy. I was perfectly happy to wait. However, I do not appreciate being shooed out of the restaurant and made to feel like it was my fault while the manager, I think, scolded the waitress for almost sitting us before another couple that we (and apparently the waitress) hadn't realised was waiting. Embarrassed, we walked out and endured the glares from that couple although all we had done was said 'table for two?' When we were seated, the appetiser came in a very rushed rambling of the description as though he didn't have time for us or this at all. We then proceeded to wait eons for the food until, after realising we kept looking over, the manager finally came over and said 'There's some quality issues with the white rice. We are cooking a new batch now. I think you should change to the brown rice.' When told that 'no, we would prefer to wait for the white rice, thanks', he kept trying to convince us to change our minds before, defeated, he went to the kitchen to check how long it would take. Incredibly, two seconds later, we were told that they weren't sure the second batch wouldn't have the same quality issue (in the white rice? Really?) and we should take the brown rice. 'Should' was being used in a 'you should take it or you have no rice' sort of way. At this, we had no choice but to agree to the brown rice. At this point, I'd like to say that I have nothing against brown rice, but my partner really did not want brown rice and was willing to wait for the white rice anyway.The katsudon did arrive with very little rice drowned in the sauce. It definitely wasn't a good katsudon sauce either and the lack of rice made for a too salty too sweet katsudon. Perhaps they were running out of brown rice, seeing as there isn't any white rice apparently. There wasn't an apology though he did appear at the end of the meal and asked 'did you like the food'. We just smiled, as we didn't want to deal with him anymore, but it was an awfully disappointing experience. In fact, I was still thinking about that satisfying katsudon I never had the next day, and went to Ginza bairin for dinner promptly. I wouldn't recommend people not to go for the tonkatsu, but just a word of caution about the service. Also, I've heard the service at the Bugis branch is much better anyway. For that price and quality though, I'd just go for the cheaper Ginza Bairin's chicken katsudon set. It's much much more gratifying."

Having never patronised T before, it was a clear winner on the freshness list, and we were warmly greeted by chirpy servers. We were quickly served balls of chilled, grated radish and a detailed look through the menu saw us ordering up Mameton, their self proclaimed bestseller, an Iberico pork set, and an Ebikatsu set. All orders come with a side of rice (plain or multi grain), pickles and soup.Taste wise: wow. It's a clear difference between pedestrian pork, dished out in the Mameton set, and Iberican pork. The breaded crust (panko?) was delightful to bite into, and not cloyingly oily as katsus are wont to be. The Iberico was well marbled, I.e. fatty, which provided a juicy burst or meaty goodness with each bite. It's not to say that the regular version was shoddy, but it just paled so much in comparison when side by side with the Spanish cut. The ebikatsu wasn't too bad, though strangely I adored the side of finely shredded cabbage. Icy cold, the servers would come around offering extra servings of fibre, which went very well when liberally doused with the accompanying sesame dressing. In addition, the meals come with roasted tea and a small cube of jelly as dessert. The flavours seem to vary daily, and ours was peach - cold, clean tasting, and not overly sweet. Price wise, three sets came up to shy of $100, though it also has to do with going for the premium pork. I do enjoy the service though, we're hard pressed to find sincere and friendly waitstaff around here. And the fact that it consists of cute Japanese blokes makes it so much more of a rarity!"

Wow, pretty impressive.Good morning Nanyang is small and convenient, right by the Chinatown station. I got a honey lemon drink, while my mom got a complicated version of coffee. Quick service on a weekday afternoon. There's also a buzzer to let us know when our food is ready. I had traditional toast, good but nothing special. Orange ciabatta with butter was surprisingly tasty! A little sweetness, but not too much. Nicely toasted and not too much butter. Love it!My honey lemon drink was nicely done. Not too sweet but not too bland. My mom also really enjoyed her coffee, and has been frequenting this location for awhile. I wouldn't make a special trip to visit, but if I was by chinatown and was looking for a short break or snack, I will definitely stop by. P.S. there is free wifi if you need some!"

The coffee was nice but it was not sweet. Perfect for those who always order their drinks as ""siu dai"" (less sweet) as this is their normal. I requested for more sweetness and it was still not as sweet as the drinks you get at Ya Kun or Killiney or Toastbox. The rice which came with the chicken curry was very hard. It looked like it was scraped from the bottom of the rice cooker. Either that or it was old rice. Being a Monday I would not be surprised if they actually served leftover rice. The chicken curry was good, thick rich spicy gravy with potato and 3 pieces of chicken (2 mini drumlets and a mid-wing). It got noisy when packed and you could hardly hear yourself think. There was nothing to absorb the noise. I would be interested to try the other food as they do have different types of bread for toast."

A tad more expensive than the rest but the bread alone already costs SGD$3.00 (promo price). The highlight was the black charcoal bread. A good amount of sunflower seeds on the bread.

We tried to make reservations for 6 on a Sunday afternoon but they were running a full house so we had to settle for the 8 pm slot. Service was brisk as the place was bustling with activity. My favorite dish here is their signature Crab Beehoon 龍記米粉蟹. The thin strands of rice vermicelli had absorbed the rich flavours of the crab jus and brown sauce. The crab was perfectly cooked and delectably succulent. Don't forget to order this dish when you visit. The Har Cheong Gai 虾酱鸡翅 (Deep-Fried Chicken Wings marinated in Shrimp Paste) is another dish worth splurging your calorie intake on. I loved the crispy skin and juicy meat.If you have a weakness for Salted Egg Yolk (like moi), definitely order the Pan fried Salted Egg Pork Rib 咸蛋排骨. The grainy texture and the umami-rich savoury flavour of the Salted Egg Yolk coating around the browned pork ribs adds another level of enjoyment to the juicy meat.

Possibly even better than when the chef-owner was toiling in the kitchens at the now-defunct Golden Spoon Seafood (it was ""that other restaurant"" across the carpark from Por Kee).We had:1) Long Ji Crab Bee Hoon ($): a towering mound of bee hoon drenched in broth with a crab sitting pretty atop, looks impressive but pedestrian in taste. A little disappointing, after all that hype. The lard-tinged broth was sweet but lacked depth, and needed a little spice or piquancy to kick it up several notches. I had to ask for copious lashings of fried garlic crisps, and sambal,for oomph.2) Fermented Pork Belly ($15 for small): another signature dish but wow did it deliver. The bite-sized strips of pork were scrumptious- flavoursome, and juicy. Elevated by that awesome sambal that was at once punchy and lively. I'll return just for these.3) Cereal Pumpkin Beancurd ($18 for small): also lackluster. It was creamy and sweet enough, but one-dimensional in flavour, and missing in that well-rounded savoury component."

Despite us asking our server twice about the status of our pies, and the server both times confirming that they're on their way, an hour passes before we get fed up and ask for the manager.Another server comes over, we calmly explain the situation, and say that if the pizzas are indeed on their way, we should have them comped as we've waited way too long. By the look on her face, I knew she didn't want to do that. So then she goes on to say there isn't a manager on duty, and that she can relay our concerns when he comes back.... tomorrow. Or give him a call. Yup. I will let you come to your own conclusions about that.We continued to push, saying that we'll just cancel it and head out. But she insists that the pizza is already done and that cancelling it is not possible. This goes on for a while, until she finally checks with the kitchen. She comes back, acknowledges there was an operational error, then FINALLY decides to give us the pizza for free.To add insult to injury, we asked for the check as I wolfed down the 2000 and late pizza, only for them to take an additional 20 minutes to run our credit cards and close out our tab.I'm pretty sure that this place has been around for a while, so I wouldn't necessarily say this service lapse is a teething problem.

Only bee hoon is used, no other way about it. It's Hakka style, so you get three kinds of ingredients - fish balls, fish paste wrapped in bean curd skin, and tofu - and the chilli and sweet sauce dip goes with the ingredients nicely. There's an undeniably homely feel to a piping hot bowl of flavorful, soupy bee hoon with some soy beans nestled at the bottom in the middle of the day. Granted, you'd be drenched in sweat after the lunch hour, but resistance is futile. Come early as some of the items get sold out sooner than others.

Some were a bit hard and others not bad.Ribs were only so so. Meat not so tender even though we asked for softer meat.

Located opposite the Tiong Bahru market, there is usually a fair amount of people but I never had an issue locating a seat. I usually go for the big ribs, pork kidney and noodles - all good. Not the cheapest around. That combi that I usually order, with a drink, would cost about $20 for one person.

This style of soup is best if you like to drink heaps of it, as it isn't overly peppery and tastes more like the natural sweetness of pork. I confess I had three bowls of it - free flow right?Perhaps considered a slightly unique preference, I like to eat BKT with innards. They serve a mix of innards here - liver, kidney, and a some large intestines. They serve the innards BKT with the liver slightly undercooked so it bleeds into the soup. If you do eat innards, but dislike them bloody, make sure you tell them about it, or wait a while before tucking into your food.As usual for BKT, you eat them with fried dough crullers (you tiao) soaked in soup, ad salted vegetables, black sauce, and soup with rice.

I suppose Bak Kut Teh is to me what chicken rice is to most other people.Now, the Bak Kut Teh here isn't really the peppery sort, nor is it the herbal sort. WHAT SORT COULD IT BE THEN you ask?It's... the sweet sort. Ostensibly peppery, the pepper here is so mild that you actually get the natural sweetness of the pork coming through. For those of you who've had various Chinese-style pork soups (like, pig stomach soup for example), you'll know the sweetness I'm talking about.That's not bad mind you, some people like the milder, sweeter flavour of the soup.But it's not for me. I like my Bak Kut Teh peppery, with a zing. The other dishes are a-okay too, since it's unlikely you'll turn up just to order BKT.Peanuts, salted veg, youtiao, they're all done decently. The star here though is always going to be the soup, and the 'dragon ribs'."

Add to that a side of of stewed salted veggies and plain white rice, and you're good to roll.

The pork is tender with sufficient give at each chew, and the salted veggies and gravy are complement the rice nicely. Humble fare with homely food - while it's not knock your socks off awesome, it makes a great option for a simple lunch.

The Biachi Funghi, a mushroom with truffle cream white pizza is delicious. Earthy, rich, savoury, I think I'd be able to finish this myself. The Fennel Sausage and Breakfast pizza are also both delicious and highly recommended.The pizzas definite must be eaten hot, and when they are, they're gooey, delicious, and wonderful. I've gone to PS.Cafe Petit more times than I can remember, whether for lunch, or to grab a pizza to bring home, or just for a salad when I'm not inclined to all the local food on offer in the area.This is possibly one of the most underrated pizza joints in Singapore, and while I wouldn't say it's better than Mozza, I can't say it's worse either.

Cafés, the service here is pretty bad. I know that there's no service charge, and it's supposed to be a quick service restaurant (I'm trying to withhold using the term fast food joint here), but the utter nonchalance and bluntness of the staff here is ludicrous.Staffers are supposed to stand aside/make way for customers when they're walking through, but not here. I live nearby and patronize the cafe relatively often, and I always observe them trying to boss their way around, forcing customers to either bump into them or give way. Needless to say I wasn't going to let them push me around, but the experiences I've had were really unpleasant.The positives - truffle fries here are great, and are their pizzas. But my favorite has gotta be the Pullman's panini. Juicy chunks of chicken with mustard pressed between a cheesy and crisp panini, it's one of my favorite sandwiches around.I prefer the food here compared to the full restaurants, which tend to sometimes be over complicated, as they are simple, fast, and tasty.Overall, quite the opposite from the main restaurants.

Scrambled Eggs & Croissant w/ Crispy Bacon ($15.90)Scrambled Eggs, consistent with mine so that's a good sign. The croissant was pretty buttery and was nice and flakey. Bacons were fried nice and crispy (although I'm more of the juicy tender bacon person than the crispy sort).The salad was an after though and came looking a bit limp and old. The most disappointing? The salad wasn't washed clean. The wife was just about to take a bit and suddenly noticed a dead ant on one of the lettuce leaves. Tsk tsk. Big disappointment.

The coffee sadly is very average.There were a lot of design types working away on laptops when I was there and I get the impression it's that kind of place.

My husband swears by their French toast with bananas and bacon, which comes with two nice thick slices of eggy fried brioche, sliced bananas, crispy bacon all drenched in maple syrup! The sweet and savory combo wins him over. For me I always end up with the pork cheek sandwich. I agree with Marcus L, a little bit more toasted would be great. But once Ive sunk my teeth into that porky, cheesy, oily goodness I forget all about it. The small salad that comes with it lets me delude myself of it being pretty healthy.

Somehow it feels genuine and laid-back, which can hardly be said for nearby establishments like Forty Hands and Open Door Policy, both of which have amassed loyal cult followings (quite deservedly) and lost their chill factor in the process. Well I suppose crowds are a good thing for cafes to have, though it would be nice to be able to have a meal without feeling like I'm in someone else's way all the time.These crowds were absent from Flock when we visited one Saturday afternoon for tea. Bit of a welcome change from having to wait in the sweltering heat for a table. It wasn't that the eatery was devoid of people - there was a steady trickle of customers, and the staff looked hard at work.Portobello, mozzarella & rocket sandwich, $13.50 - Since this was supposed to be tea we ordered one of their sandwiches to share. T'was a pricey sandwich, but I liked that the juicy portobello shroom was so big it occupied the entire pocket of ciabatta. This was quite delicious and would have made a substantial lunch for one, though y'know, the pig in me wishes they had fries on the side.They have other interesting offerings on their sandwich list like prawn and avocado, as well as pork cheek and gruyere.Orange bundt cake, $5.00 - Having had a disappointing encounter with a bundt cake the week before, we decided to give the orange bundt cake here a shot. I thought it had a nice citrusy fragrance and crumbled quite satisfactorily, but the others found it to be a little too dry.Mocha, $6.00 - Flock sources its beans from the ever-reliable Liberty Coffee, which pretty much ensures quality coffee brews.

Nope, not  Chye Seng Huat or 40 Hands or 3 Hands or no hands (in fact when we drove out of the carpark at Moh Guan terrace I only realized that 40 hands was around the corner from Flock). We decided on Flock because the dude wanted AM brunch and we try to explore new places on the fly. Flock has all the elements of a coffee-centric hipster joint (this kind of sounds like I'm describing the Manic Pixie Dream Girl): Gentrified neighborhood, check. Bare concrete or exposed ceilings/fixtures, check. Food sources labelled (albeit in this it's ba/cakeries not farms), check.Prices that make me double take, check. Servers that look like my brother's friends, check.Kids in clothes that are like ""This? oh I had this ol' Cambridge satchel at the back of my closet"", check.We ordered a scrambled eggs & bacon croissant-wich and the croque monsieur. The first sandwich kind of worked but the chef needs more practice doing a scramble (heat control dude!). Parts of my eggs were fully cooked and parts were liquid. Without jumping in the kitchen, I'd say go have the big breakfast at Food For Thought to see what I mean by a good, even scramble. The rashes of bacon seemed to be lifted straight out of a packet into the pan because they were all stuck together. The croque monsieur was again, passable but kind of eh compared to the mother of all ham sandwiches at Choupinette.Decent meal delivered fairly quickly. Chilled out environs. The coffee-centric hipster joint experience."

The cappuccino met my standards (taste-wise) and was quite pretty, latte art-wise!I love the ambiance here; for some reason, I didn't find it as cramped as 40 Hands, around the corner.

The croissant was gone in I daresay 3 bites, filling and all, and a croissant sandwich and iced tea coming out to $20 dollars is kinda ridiculous.

I've never been able to make it down to the roaster because of their crazy sporadic opening hours and I haven't really seen it around town that much. But Flock serves it and I drank it. And so far I don't think it's to my taste. The roast just seems too light to me. If the coffee isn't coming through the milk strongly in a double shot piccolo latte then there's basically no point serving it in a milk beverage. Maybe my palate is that messed up from years of smoking but unfortunately it's the only palate I have.Otherwise I'm a fan of Flock, primarily for its quaint neighbourhood vibe and friendly service. As other reviewers have noted, staff are Singaporean (as opposed to 40 Hands) and while I have no problem with Filipino service, I do appreciate an outlet that will pay more for inexperienced locals who actually care about what they're doing. The staff at 40 Hands have never seemed particularly interested to me.The proprietor seemed like a very nice lady who cared enough to serve & speak to customers with a smile. And again, unlike 40 Hands, there was no smug 'we-are-so-successful' vibe about the place. Plus I hate the 40 Hands coffee so this is a step up.While I like their famous pork cheek, it usually feels a bit too heavy for me to take as a first meal of the day. I plump for the prawn & avocado sandwich. I am particularly amused by the Turkish bread they use because it makes me feel like I'm in Melbourne circa 2002. Remember when Turkish bread was a thing, guys?"

The barista is well trained and takes the time to do it right -- it can take 5-10 minutes to get your drink but you can be sure it's done perfectly. I think the cappuccinos here are probably closer to what you'd get in Italy than some of the better places in San Francisco since the coffee beans used here are on more of the delicate side and the milk used tastes more creamy than what is normally used in the US.For food their banana foster french toast is one of the best french toast dishes I've ever had (a big surprise). The bread used looked like a standard loaf but had the buttery flavor and partial texture of a croissant. Served with a light maple syrup and topped with bananas and served with bacon, it was just fantastic!"

The front is open-air with artificial turf that kids can (and do) run around on a little bit; there's also an ice cream cart that you can get indulge yourself at (with the help of a barista from inside the shop). Inside, the ordering area is lined with lots of different bites, especially cupcakes. The enclosed seating area is to the left of the outside area; we didn't actually make our way in there as we wanted to enjoy the (mild) relief that the rain brought. We didn't have to wait too long for our drinks, and they were both solid - mine was a very refreshing agave lemonade that I housed in about a minutes' time; my wife went with a fruity iced tea that was still quite unsweetened and was a much more subtle flavor. We did grab a brownie to share as well; while the texture was a tad chalkier than I like, I did like the faint hint of fruit (think it was blackberry, or something similar) that was baked into it.While it's a tad out of the way, Plain Vanilla is on a street that has a few other hipster-y shops as well, and it's a solid place to grab a brew (or another beverage) and relax/work."

A bakery cum cafe, the place is decorated in a way that allure you to instagram every single corner. They have seats in front of the bakery; even a swing if you prefer. Step further in, you're brought to the food display! Loved the look of everything! Even the glimpse of cake pans and baking tools in their huge cupboard was instagram-worthy. Haha! Kudos to whoever the interior designer was.They sell, tarts, cakes, brownies and etc. Even cookie and cake mixes in jars. How wonderful! But what captivated us the most were the cupcakes on display. Me being the salted caramel lover ordered 2 of those, vanilla and hazelnut chocolate ones. Prices for the cupcakes were alright, standard. But the drinks! Blimey! $7 for a cup of lemonade? Eh?! And oh! You might as well know that they don't offer you any paper bag to stuff your cake boxes. They'll just tie them up with a string to act as a handle. Quite the hassle if you're already holding many things in hand."

The charming entrance greets you warmly with an army of vintage aqua bikes, an open communal dining space and a glass tankard of lemon scented water (they understand the effects of humidity!) The shop itself is lined with daily specials, old favourites and row upon row of Plain Vanilla's famous cupcakes - to me, these are definitely the best cupcakes in Singapore!They have a great texture and deviate away from being outlandishly sweet; I love that every flavour says what it means and means what it says. Must-trys are the Earl Grey and Cinnamon! The cupcakes start from $3.50 each and I usually grab a box of 6; just like the Sound of Music, they're adorably tied up with string! (A useful handle for when you're commuting with cupcakes!) I love the ritual of hopping a few doors down to Books Actually to grab some reading material and then settling myself into a quiet corner at PV Bakery.

And those nibs add that crunch and a touch of that bittersweet raw chocolate finish...

One look at the shop and its location at Waterfront Plaza, and it was clear that this place is not in my price range for an average lunch. I had a grilled salmon rice set which consisted of 9 items in total and it was $19++. In fact, their set lunch was actually impressively extensive from katsudon to udon or soba, to huge rice sets and at a price range of about $16++ to $25++. Although that is not exactly cheap, given the prices of Japanese food that I've sampled in the past month, it is quite reasonable. In fact, the katsudon is cheaper than Ginza Bairin. Service was, without a doubt, outstanding. From the minute I stepped in, I was taken care of, including pulling my chair out, removing the paper cover of my chopsticks, hot towels and hangers for our bags. The location, beside the river, was somewhat scenic but it was a little too hot for dining outdoors. My only disappointment was after the meal. We were hoping to have ice-cream after our meal upon realizing that they had sakura ice-cream, but we were informed too late that they were actually closed at 3pm and so we could not have our dessert. As you would expect from a Japanese restaurant that had Japanese customers, the food was delicious. I had my grilled salmon with just salt but the salmon was soft inside and the skin was cooked to a crisp. There were 9 items in the rice set, namely cucumbers and pickles, lotus root, bitter gourd, chawanmushi, rice, miso soup, the main i.e. salmon, 2 slices of sashimi and watermelon. I especially liked the lotus root dish which was sweet and savoury as well as the silky chawanmushi. For the price I paid, I was rather impressed by the meal which was a lot more than I had expected. I will definitely have more lunches with my friend while she's still working in the area."

It is just so hard to find good salmon belly sashimi, and it is ironic that I find the best salmon belly sashimi not in california, not in japan (at least where I've been) but here in Singapore. In general, my attitude towards japanese food in Singapore is ""jaded"". I feel like in order to get decent sashimi, you usually have to pay an arm and a leg. And usually when I do, I am not impressed by the quality. This salmon belly is well marbled with fat, super fresh, and evey slightly sweet! Even at 6 bucks a slice, I am willing to pay it. The chef recommendation's seasonal dish, salmon roe with soy sauce and yuzu was another winner. The salmon roe was not at all salty (which means it's fresh) and lightly seasoned with soy sauce, and the yuzu just brings finesse to it. The grilled saba was decent, but not impressive. Will definitely come back for the omakase or chirashi or just a sushi meal. Thank you for making me believe in Singapore again!"

I was here during dinnertime and although there was not much of a queue, there was still quite a lot of people in the restaurant.I had the grilled teriyaki gindara set, which was, to be honest, quite average. Perhaps they weren't having a particularly good day, but I found that the gindara here wasn't too fresh and was even slightly overcooked. However, the taste was pretty good to be honest.We also had the tempura, and I enjoyed this a lot. I found that the prawn tempura was soft and crispy, with just a touch of oil and has a very good bite to it. Definitely high recommended.Overall, this is a great place to have a decent Japanese meal with good ambience."

Chestnut in liquid form... no, liquor form!Onto the Yaki: Now you can do this thing 2 ways:- Way 1 if you're adventurous is to a la carte the yakitori; this'll require an exploratory palate and a reliable ""I'm full!"" meter.- Way 2 for the casual is to just go the set... we went the set and there was zero 'gret. Why? They pace the courses out with an explanation for each; they are bang on with bags of flavour; and you get to discuss the current course as you digest; before the next one arrives.Whilst the bincho'ed yaki is exceptional on its lonesome, the addition of condiments like yuzu, black mushroom salt, japanese mustard, and the always welcome wasabi elevates the dishes into the stratosphere!I think this is a crazy good date spot for you tinder fiends, and bumble bees, or if you wanna just chill with a bud and nosh it's also fantastic fare for that sorta shindig.My dining partner and I were hydrating regularly and the waitstaff were exceptional at refilling with ice n' a slice h2o every time we dipped below half glass.Special mention needs to be made of their delightful course description before serving as this adds to the overall culinary experience.If you can find this hidden gem, then you've already discover a slice of Japan in the little red dot!"

The food and cocktails both are extremely great.My girlfriend and I made a Chope reservation to check this place out on a weekday night. We heard about Bincho through the shoutout from Singapore Airlines in their in flight magazine for SG50 and knew we needed to check out this hidden yakitori spot. You find a very nondescript corner of a building with a sign that says to go in through the back of the building where you walk in to what looks like a small tunnel. Since we were having dinner, we walked past the lounge/bar area and sat at the counter, bracing ourselves for some solid yakitori.We went ahead with the Bincho yakitori tasting menu which included:1) An appetizer platter (chicken liver pate with baguette, octopus tentacle with some veggies, and some prawn dish), 2) Assorted Sashimi (salmon, tuna and snapper)3) Soup that you drink then eat its ingredients from the pot (included some fish, a prawn and chicken), 4) Chicken yakitori platter (neck, wing, breast and thigh), 5) Choice of lamb, fish or waygu beef skewered, 6) Japanese tomato 7) Tsukune Don - Chicken patty with rice and egg 8) Seasonal fruits which is japanese peach and grape. We shared one of those tastings then ordered 3 items off their a la carte - kinki fish, veggie platter and these yams convered with pork (looks like mini hot dogs) called Red Monnyaku Kurrabuta Roll. THIS KURRABUTA ROLL WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST DISHES I'VE TASTED HERE IN SINGAPORE. Insanely good, we devoured these in record time. Highly recommend you order that one and the veggies too. Kinki fish was great although it has many bones to pick through.Only thing I wish for is that they use the yakitori sticks for all of the meats they serve. That's usually my favorite thing about any yakitori place, even the Michelin starred ones around the world. For the cocktails, we ordered the Yuzu, Sake, Gin one which was light, refreshing and really nice. The one that really hits the spot is their Mangosteen Cinnamon cocktail which also has vodka. It tastes like a spiked apple cider drink, extremely easy to drink.Service is impeccable, ambiance is very New York/underground Tokyo feel and the food is excellent. I would highly recommend coming here on a date or to impress someone. I for sure will be coming back again and and again."

Some of the pieces of the tori zukushi set were delicious - the assorted appetizer, chicken liver, tsukune with egg yolk, and soft bone karaage stands out. However the rest of the food in the set were bland and underwhelming. But to me personally the star of the night was the garlic pork (a-la carte). The meat was well seasoned, crispy on the outside and the garlic complimented the pork really well. We also ordered grilled squid from the a-la carte menu, but it was very chewy. While I think my meal at Bincho was overall satisfying, I found the price to be too steep for the amount and quality of food we were getting. It was more like a been-there-done-that experience, and I don't think I'll be coming back for their food.

Sets start at $25 before tax and go up to $40+, but you get a drink, a starter (of 2 chicken drumsticks), another starter (of chicken skin salad which was oh-so-yummy), your main and then dessert (mochi or ice cream).They recommended the chicken dishes (it's a yakitori restaurant afterall) but because we were greedy, we had the ikura negitoro (salmon roll, chopped tuna belly with chives) and yakitori sets to share. Portions were reasonable (actually I was already filling up quite a bit before the main came but there's always more room for good food...) and the service was really attentive.Ikura negitoro - ingredients were fresh and good, though it could be a bit underwhelming if just for one. Afterall, there's not much texture in a negitoro don (besides soft and mushy) I'm so glad we decided to share this instead of me having it all to myself.Yakitori - the slices of chicken were moist and tender, I loved the grilled skin as well. And it looks damn good on photos in case you want to make your friends jelly. (HI IM IN THIS COOL PLACE WITH AWESOME FOOD AND YOU'RE NOT, is what I sent to my boyfriend in Brunei)The restaurant is divided into 2 areas, 1 dark and claustrophobic (and you're all sitting at 1 side of the table, facing the bar, but not AT the bar, because there's an alley between you and the bar counter) and 1 bright and airy with a nice view of the chefs grilling the yakitori. You know which one to choose.(Btw I now know where the cool entrance is and I will be using it for my next visit)"

The bar is also diverse with many Japanese microbrews, sake and even an all-you-can-drink beer deal on Sundays. I guess the one difference between Tokyo and Bincho is the price.

That's usually my favorite thing about any yakitori place, even the Michelin starred ones around the world. For the cocktails, we ordered the Yuzu, Sake, Gin one which was light, refreshing and really nice. The one that really hits the spot is their Mangosteen Cinnamon cocktail which also has vodka. It tastes like a spiked apple cider drink, extremely easy to drink.Service is impeccable, ambiance is very New York/underground Tokyo feel and the food is excellent. I would highly recommend coming here on a date or to impress someone. I for sure will be coming back again and and again."

Bincho looks wonderful. It's set up in an old Tiong Bahru coffee shop, has been retrofitted with many bells & whistles and yet manages to keep the romantic old school vibe while still providing a comfortable modern dining experience. That is a big achievement. Unfortunately that is where the achievements end.My dining partner and I went for their two omakase-style sets (Bincho & Fuji) that were semi-delineated on their chalkboard menu while leaving some room for the chef to make decisions. We were really quite disappointed with both the quality of the food and the quality of the service.Firstly, on the food. I get that Japanese food is supposed to be simple. But that doesn't mean it's supposed to be average. The beauty of being a master Japanese chef is that you can use the natural flavours of your ingredients in a simple execution to deliver deliciousness. This did not happen here. There were too many courses for me to call out individually but the food was uninspired, often bland and not even remotely appearing like value for money.Those two sets and a beer with the ++ we are accustomed to ended up at $250+ for two. Not the most expensive meal in Singapore but certainly not the cheapest. But where is the value? We received several (I mean like 4) sets of yakitori pieces that I have seen better executed for much less money at Ippudo Tao. Dessert consisted of a single strawberry and a slice of rockmelon. The chawanmushi was plain egg with a single scrap of meat. I could go on.This was capped off by service that lacked any kind of finesse. Staff were obviously inexperienced at service for this price point. English language was poor, explanations on dishes were unavailable and etiquette was lacking (case-in-point, if you're a waitress, don't stand around in the dining room on your phone looking bored).The donburi course was presented as consisting of ""chicken thigh"". Upon closer inspection, there was clearly no chicken. When I highlighted this to my server, he first suggested I was wrong. When I challenged him to show me the chicken and pointed out that I could see fish cake, mushroom and egg, the response was ""of course it's a mix lahhh"". I politely suggested he should check with his chef. Upon returning he informed me that it was a completely different dish to what he introduced when he served it. With no chicken and no apology. In a related aside, where is the finesse in a rice bowl with supermarket fish-cake, egg and basic enoki mushrooms?Not good enough Bincho. Why should I spend $250 at your restaurant for bad food and bad service when I can go to Ikyu around the corner and have an infinitely superior meal? Answer - I won't again."

Fortunately, Lor Mee 178 was worth the plunge and is probably the only Lor Mee I'll ever eat. (Please stay that way forever.)Here's the breakdown: you get a bowl of noodles in the thick brown gravy but that's not all, you also have fried shark meat, crispy fritter bites and more crunchy stuff topped onto your noodles. That might be what made it for me. The mix of crunchy with flavourful sauce that not too starchy and good noodles that blends with the sauce. I've read very opposing views on this dish, perhaps from people who prefer to more traditional braised variety but I like this adaptation. I will travel just for this one."

While the fritters themselves were well fried, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the sharks meat and normal fish, though. Having this exotic dish already also means the stall could scrimp on more traditional accompaniments to lor mee - I couldn't find many pieces of egg, or ngoh hiong in my bowl of noodles, which, if not for the sharks meat, was nothing spectacular.

We chances upon this place and the first thing I noticed is ""home-cooked"" hainanese food. My friend did not take port so we did not order pig trotters bee hoon. We asked for recommendation. In the end, we had ginger chicken which is one of their signature dishes, samba prawns, and long beans. For the portion of 2 people, it's just ok. Not too heavy and not too light.  My friend asked whether he could order one more veg. So we ordered broccoli. Yet he wanted to be spicy and the cook was able to customize the order and make it spicy. The bill in the end was $62. 4 dishes, 2 rice and 2 lime juice.  Reasonable price I would say. Because it is a home-cooked food kitchen, they are more flexible to customize orders and at the same time, very little MSG which is important. I also notice that the food was not oily like that I see in other food courts or hawker centers. The only thing is that they don't accept credit cards. So remember to bring debit cards or cash before you go. They also do not open on Tuesdays."

Pork chop was very nicely done, it had the crispy-and-juicy combo just right. The portion size was just right for me, though I can think of a few people who would complain as the rice portion is a little less than usual. I throughly enjoyed it. Price tag to a pork chop curry rice = $9. Their menu looks has your usual flair of Hainanese dishes. The table next to mine had at least 2 families and the dishes on the table looks great. Look forward to going back there to try.A few tips : 1) if you have a party of more than 2, please call ahead to book.  2) it is a coffee shop setting, so it can get pretty hot especially in the recent weather3) following from no. 2, if you are sitting inside, sit somewhere in the middle.

It shares the space with a yong tofu stall, a vegetarian dish stall and a kopi and drinks stall. This is also the former storefront of Two Face which is now closed. Their main staple is their home-made pasta and they change their menu from time to time.  The way it works is really the same as any of the other yong tofu stalls, you place your order with ah bong (or his friend) and pay.  You then take a seat at one of the tables and a kopi uncle will approach you to take your orders for drinks.  They made their own pasta (I spotted a pasta maker in the corner) so you can be assured that the pasta is fresh. So far I have tried their vongole (which comes with al dente linguine and fresh clams).  The quality is pretty consistent as I have tried that a few times.  I have also had the pappardelle pork genovese (ribbon pasta cooked with pork, wine and onion) which is very rich and tasty.  One thing I noticed is that the pasta is always cooked right.  They also offer desserts - the early grey infused creme brulee was not bad, not too sweet.I find this localized Italian eating experience very interesting.  Ah Bong only operates in the day but it's a good way to enjoy relatively inexpensive ($6-9) quality pasta in an al fresco setting with the Monkey King Temple right in front of you and hey, if you also crave yong tofu, it's right beside you when you finished the pasta!"

I'd been wanting to try this place for months but I can't leave my workplace for lunch and it's only open from 10am - 2pm. Finally, a day off after working throughout the night. I was starving when I came here and we all know that hunger is the best seasoning. I was here with renowned Yelp food critic, Josh T, my TB food buddy, as his workplace is in the area. We tried the Mac and Cheese with Truffle Oil and the Warm Bath, which looked nothing like a pool of water.Food- The Mac and Cheese looked nowhere like Mac and Cheese. More like penne with cheese in a bowl. There was more pasta than cheese (in the other renditions I've tried, it was the other way round). Not necessarily a bad thing- I liked it as it was light and not overtly creamy like the other versions and it was very affordable at $3. Truffle oil was worth adding as the dish would have been rather bland without it. Sauce reminded me of Pastamania's turkey bacon cheesy crumble sauce. Not an insult as I like that dish (yes I know my street cred disappeared the moment I said that).Warm bath was penne in anchovy butter with an egg (almost Onsen-like) and long beans. It was unexpectedly plain-looking and I would have preferred more toppings to go along (how about some real anchovies hmmmm). Very affordable at $7 but between this and something else on my next visit, I'd choose the latter.Service- Ah Bong/Chris was very friendly and attentive, asking us if we were doing ok etc. Coffee shop uncle kept on telling me that I couldn't have the cup of coffee that I'd bought from Tiong Bahru bakery. 3 times. Ok point taken.Ambience - don't come here if you want ambience. This is a coffee shop.More like 3.5 stars but because Ah Bong was nice I'm rounding it up. Would return."

Came at 9pm and all ribs and burnt ends were sold out. So I got the $60 platter with brisket, pulled pork and links, with sides of mac and cheese, cornbread and brisket beans.Not the best Texan bbq I've had, but in Singapore, this might be the best there is, and I suppose that needs to suffice.The beans were a bit too sweet and not mellow savory enough for my taste, but the chunk of brisket inside made for a pleasant surprise.The mac and cheese was pretty good. Enjoyed it thoroughly.The cornbread did not come out as I expected. It was definitely not southern style cornbread. But it did the job of soaking the juices, so I give it so merit.The brisket is flavorful, moist and fork tender. So tender that if you try to lift it up with just your fork, it might slip off or fall apart before it reaches your plate. Which is what happened to me. It's a good thing.The pulled pork was a bit too sweet and too wet. The rub isn't savory and spicy enough.. perhaps it's tweaked to suit local palettes? but I thought you serve authentic Tex bbq? hmm....... oh also, I get that they're trying to avoid people ever calling out their meats as dry, but this was a bit too wet.. on the upside, there's more juices to wipe the cornbread with.The links were the most meh. The beef links were good, but the lamb and pork were meh.The letdown was the pork belly burnt ends for $12 / 100 grams. I know what burnt ends are supposed to look like... this did not look like that. On its own, as its own dish, ok fine it's meat, well smoked and bbq'd.

Beef brisket is cooked over wood and served dry with sauce on the side.I'm a little partial to Kansas and Memphis style barbecue (dry rub), but I definitely end up here when I have a craving for American barbecue. Please skip the other places like *cough* Morganfields cos this is definitely far more legit.The place is named after Elliot Decker, the chef/owner, who learned the ropes in Austin.4-stars relative to what you can get in Singapore, 3-stars if compared to other places in the United States.

Texas? Kansas City? Memphis? Carolina? All would claim their barbecue is best. Of course none of this matters when you live in Singapore and develop a craving for some, any good US barbecue joints. Yes, there are a few but this latest place may claim to be the best yet. It really is that good. We went looking for it having read a posting on another website talking about Decker Barbecue which had only just opened behind Boomerang at Robertson Quay. We arrived to the wondrous  sight of healthy portions of delicious barbecue meat being served to patrons in a simple open air restaurant. The menu is simple as you can see from the photo. We ordered a couple of Brewdog beers (the only non Non-American beer  that they stick) and strode to the counter to order. And then heartbreak as the staff started to put Sold Out signs on the Brisket. Denial!Disappointed but not broken we ordered turkey with pulled pork and chopped beef with the two side dishes of Brisket Beans and Potato Salad. Service was fast and very friendly (in truth a rarity in Singapore). However good as the service was, it was the quality of the food that was the star here. It was simply fantastic. The sliced turkey was very tender and the right side of moist. The chopped beef had some spice with great flavour and the pulled pork was the first one that we finished, so that should speak for itself. The brisket beans were great with enough brisket in to give us a hint of what we were missing, with the potato salad trailing behind a little in the flavor stakes. From talking to Elliott and Min,  the partners of the restaurant this place is clearly a labour of love. As their first week in business at the location finished, more sold out signs went up. Disappointing for them and the customers who came along only to be denied. For sure they will make sure this doesn't happen again and for sure we will be back to try the brisket the next time.  For those craving some fantastic Barbecue, don't miss Decker."

They take great pride in their work, and it shows through the well executed smoked meats. I particularly like that they use a variety of local wood (lychee last time I was there) to impart flavor. Having said that, I don't know if the food at this price point warrants multiple revisits. The experience brings you close to the familiarities of proper bbq, but nothing puts it over the top. You leave full, but not entirely satisfied. I've been here twice, and frankly wouldn't come back unless I had a rare hankering for Southern bbq.

The staff was also extremely unknowledgeable about the menu, so we ended up having to point out what we wanted on the menu.Looking at previous yelp pictures, the food offer has also changed: there is less variety in the sashimi, no crab legs or grilled prawns anymore. Nevertheless, I must admit that I really liked the quality of the sashimi and the tempura was not too bad either.You would probably be able to convince me to go again for the sashimi but I'll have to forget about the service and the seating arrangements first so it might take me a while before I'll go again!"

For a Japanese buffet in Singapore, this is quite cheap!I found the food here surprisingly good, and sashimi here is fresh and thickly sliced. They are not stingy, but you will have to be very specific with your orders. Everything else like tempura and grilled items are the same standard as what you will find at Sushi Tei. For what you pay, really, this place is a bargain. Service is very iffy here, and they are quite under-staffed, but you can't ask for too much when you're not paying top dollar for reasonably acceptable food.

Quality of sushi for Asia is minus to mediocre - at best. As an avid traveler and eater, I have had my fair share of sushi. My best experience thus far has been in Japan at the tsukiji fish market. I would rank this in terms of quality and taste as the worst sushi I have had in Asia thus far. I would also rank many places in America above this restaurant. Their service and staffing is fantastic though.Specifics:Temperature of the sushi: warm.Cut of the sushi: excellent thickness.Quality of the sushi: poor quality, very muscular, stringy, viscous and low fat content. Flavor of sushi: potent fishy taste, the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna all taste the same. Temperature of rice: rice was cooler than the sushi! Big  no no.Quality: grainy and lacks the traditional ""sticky rice"" feel.Flavor of rice: average. Sushi to rice ratio: 1:1 ratio, which is fantastic.Conclusion: This is a no go."

You go NTUC buy sashimi oso $95 per kg aredi. So if you got big belly, confirm can eat enough to cover the price. Remark: Much less crowded than when I last came in 2013 - possibly because of the recent sashimi scare. Which is good if you are not a typical Hamji-porean, because less crowded means prompter and better service."

It's got a good size piece of chicken and half a crabstick. The egg is soft and tasty too. As good as the ones I make at home. 2) Fried Fishcake with Cheese - its really the normal Fishcake with a hole in the middle and the melted cheese together with the fried-ness. Nice! 3) Salmon Sashimi - generous, fresh thick slices of salmon yummies. You order by the slices so that awesome! 4) Teriyaki Salmon - they grill the salmon pieces till nicely charred on the edges and the thick teriyaki sauce is a great accompaniment for the taste.

This buffet is a-la-carte style and the variety is decent enough for you to be a little bewildered about what to order. A must-try (over and again) is the sashimi. Salmon, yellow-tail, tuna, octopus, hamachi - eat your fill. The tempura is also well-done with a light batter coating fresh vegetables and crunchy prawns.What I like about the vibe of this restaurant is how it isn't too posh looking - the interior is modest but exudes a nice sense of familiarity.

The restuarant itself had a humble feel to it - nothing too formal. It does a good job of recreating the traditional Japanese restaraunt atmosphere - for the seats on the side, you can even take off your shoes to sit cross-legged, Japanese style. Even the Wordart emblazoned on the menus can be nicely disarming - a nice, if unintentional touch. Sashimi was great and came in many varieties. I enjoyed the salmon, although the tuna itself was not that fresh (neither does it give the choice of parts). Compared to other Japanese buffets I've had, however, I found the variety lacking. They did not have the assorted vegetable tempura, not the baked scallops or bacon rolls I've been spoilt by. Nonetheless, the dishes they did have - chawanmushi, karage chicken, shishamo and tempura - did not dissappoint. Come here for a good meal, but leave your expectations at the door."

What could be more fun that making our own popiah from the piping hot claypot that is served within five minutes after the table is laid with all the other ingredients. Optional condiments like the sweet Chinese sausages can be ordered starting at $4 for a small plate.Priced at $18 for 6 skins, the pot provides more than enough fillings unless you stuffed each of the skin to its maximum. We had no problem  finishing this pot just by itself because the julienned bang kwang topped with mini dried prawns were juicy and fragrant. The popiah skin is resilient enough to withstand the excess moisture, though we encountered several failed attempts to transport our masterpieces into our mouth without breaking the skin.The stir-fried baby kalian ($10) that boasts a vibrant fresh shade of green, are crunchy yet permeated with the breath of wok hei. The stewed pork is yet another rich and delicious braised dish that comes with the standard white buns ($16). The bonus slices of yam escaped the humdrum of a typical stew pork bun that is stuffed only with lettuce leaf. The Fish Head and Yam soup ($16 for small) did not look inviting but received praises from the tables for its wholesome flavours. The slurry broth is furnished with subtle sweetness from the napa cabbage and yam. And the deep-fried slices of fish were meaty and delivered comforting aroma that would be impossible if they had not brush encounter with bubbling oil. But the star of the night is none other than the Pig Trotters Bee Hoon ($14 for small). One can relish in the homemade goodness of this dish that is moist but not too wet. Napa cabbage, mushrooms, bean sprouts, bits of eggs and crunchy shrimps bolster the flavours of this dish. Everyone was obsessed with this dish despite being stuffed to the brim with the earlier dishes.This is a reliable restaurant that you can count on for some wonderful heritage dishes. Just remember to place a reservation in advance especially during weekends if you do not wish to join in the queue."

I try to be fair yet critical in my yelp reviews, but this restaurant really is over-rated and expensive for the quality of food they serve. The DIY popiah set is the worst I've tried and yet they're selling at a very premium price. Mind you, the set comes with just very basic ingredients and selling for $26, $46 and $66. We ordered the $26 set and it comes with 6 pieces of popiah skin, sad-looking lettuce and beansprouts, shredded egg, and a small bowl of turnip filling. Pathetic. If you need to add on other condiments, they're sold separately. The popiah tasted rather bland. Disappointing. Looking at the portion, we knew we would still be hungry so we ordered the pork trotter bee hoon. They charge $21 that just is enough to fill up 3 small bowls for us. Nothing more. And the waitress was so unprofessional, she didn't portion the food properly, my bowl was filled with bee hoon and vege, while my colleagues' have most of the pork trotter bits and nothing else! We also ordered prawn paste fried chicken ($16) that was really bad - dry, tasteless and salty. I was in complete shock to know the total bill came up to $80+. NO, I won't take any chance in the future. The restaurant is in need of a revamp especially the food items and pricing. They could easily slash the price to half, otherwise, even though with a 30-year-old history, it won't warrant a return visit from me... ever."

Not well taken  Good chance has been a favourite for not only  Popiah but Hokkien food for many many years. One search on Google for the best Popiah in Singapore and Good Chance's name will definitely be on a list somewhere. I've had a few chances to try their popiahs so far but strangely never at their restaurant. The first time I had it was when the GF's mom ordered in for CNY (I know.. Crazy expensive but oh well....). The second time was at the Heritage Fest's ""A Taste of Heritage"" at The National Museum. Both times I thought that it was pretty good Popiah. The Bangkuang was sweet and succulent with the carrots adding an additional sweet essence to it while the skin was not too thick and really tasty. Oh... And the Chilli gave quite a kick too. So with the Gf and family being in the mood for Popiah, I couldn't be more excited when we decided to head over to their restaurant! Taking a quick glance through the menu, we decided to go for the set menu for 4. Do note that this could easily serve 5-6 if you're group does not have big eaters. 4 Pax Set Meal ($108.00) Good Chance Popiah. The star! The signature dish! The the the.... Let down. What happened to the Bangkuang?! What happened to that sweet, yummy filling I had at home and at National Museum? While it was still tender and juicy, it lacked all the natural sweetness of the ingredients that should have come from the Bangkuang, carrots, cabbage, bamboo shoots, shrimp etc and it tasted a little... Diluted. While the chilli still packed a punch and the Popiah skin still thin and yummy, the sweet sauce was clearly diluted as compared to the one that came with the Home Made Prawn Roll.Fish Maw SoupThis turned out to be the star of the set meal for me. It was tasty, generous with fish maw and crab meat and it wasn't over starched. One of the nicest, simple, fish maw soup I've had in a while. Cereal Prawn While the cereal was nice and not too oily, the prawn itself was..... Kinda tasteless. It was crunchy and a little sweet, it tasted a little like frozen prawns. Like the kind you find in fried rice. Baby KailanWhile the way they fried it and the flavour of the seasoning was nice, the baby Kailan tasted a little old. That slight bitterness had started coming through the leaves but it was still a decently fried plate of Veges. Home-Made Prawn Roll I love my Prawn roles. Crispy, juicy, salty, sweet, dipped in a beautiful sweet sauce, the prawn roll is one of those many comfort dishes. This one however was a little disappointing. No much flavour, not much texture. Tasted almost like my first attempt at making wanton, where you add a whole load of seasoning, only to cook it and wonder where all that seasoning went. Certainly not a favourite. Fried Vermicelli This would definitely be the biggest disappointment of our dinner. It looked good. Moist, full of ingredients (it was meant to be a seafood vermicelli) and it looked ready to erase my memory of the lousy seafood Beehoon I had yesterday (Xing Lou Seafood White Bee Hoon). Unfortunately, it became my second seafood noodle disappointment in 2 days. While Xing Lou just tasted salty, the Vermicelli here tasted of absolute nothing. No seafood, no oil, no soya sauce, no salt.......Nothing. It just tasted like plain Vermicelli. Logan with Almond And Mango Jelly. Aka left over ""stew"".While there was Yam Paste and mango pudding on their main menu, we ended up with the ugly step sister. Fair enough, it was a refreshing end to dinner but you can't really get it wrong with canned longan and factory made jelly. Sadly I was quite disappointed with the overall food. While the staff were friendly enough and the waiting time for food is not long at all and the food all being served piping hot, the quality unfortunately wasn't up to par. There were a few dishes we like, a few we thought were just alright and a few we really didn't like. Overall with the service we'll give it a solid 3*. Food alone I'd give it 2.5*. Is success getting to its head? Maybe.... But a lot more needs to be done to ensure that this heritage restaurant continues surviving."

The soup is also flavourful without tasting fakely sweet. 2) Silver Fish Fried Rice - slightly too salty and very savoury indeed.

Unfortunately the soup seems fishy even as only few slices were fishy. I remember that it came with pork cracklings default but it does not. Only after finishing it I overheard some customers asking for it. The crispy bee hoon with seafood and egg was in general good. However some part of the bee hoon was tough which is because it was not fried enough. The sauce was good but the vegetables taste was slightly off. It seems ought as the place seem to have a fair bit of business so the vegetables should be fresh. Both the fried pork chop and prawn paste chickens were good but you can get almost similar quality from other restaurants. They were marinated enough to give them distinct taste.

There are probably other places with equally fresh and good fish slice bee hoon soup. But the prawn paste chicken wings are fabulous! I would go there for that. The chicken was served hot, fresh out of the fryer. Crispy skin with the taste of prawn paste, and moist juicy meat make a very good fried chicken indeed. The vegetables we had was equally good. Fresh crunchy greens simply stir fried with hint of butter. The day we went for dinner, it was sorely understaffed. There were only 3 waitresses on duty and the restaurant was running a full house. It was quite a wait for everything - from getting a table, to getting a chair (table was missing a chair), to being given a menu, to taking our orders. However food was served quite fast after the order was taken and we went straight to the counter to pay our bill as it would probably take a long time to wait at the table. Apparently there was an event that day and most of the staff were on duty there. The poor aunty waitress said they barely had time to breathe while coping with the dinner rush."

There are no questions of whether you want milky or clear soup here because it's all milky--and the milkiness comes from the long brewing of fish bones. No milk here! I can feel the nourishment already. There is a choice between thick and thin fish slices (also fish head, but I don't like bones, so)--that really is a matter of personal preference, though I do like feeling I am getting more fish with the thin slices, and there's a nice ""crunch"" that isn't there with the thicker slices.

It's way better than the puny fish slices in the regular version. Prawn paste chicken - umami at its best. Hot, juicy, piquant fried chicken dipped into chill and then hungrily savored. Need I say more? Black bean beef horfun - tender beef slices, fragrant spring onion, flash fried with springy horfun. Wow. Just.. wow. The dessert menu is typical, though the deep fried yam is a thing of beauty - not cloyingly sweet, and encased in a light, crunch batter.

I can't fault him since this is probably the only place that opens for dim sum at 8.30am. When he first said ""Red Star"", I was like ""Red what??"" I have never heard of Red Star despite I was born and raised in Singapore. Personally I believe if it was any good, my dad would have brought us there when we were kids. Notice I used the ""was"". I yelped the restaurant and had already prepped myself with the 1970s decor. I didn't expect it was so bad until I seen it with my own eyes. It was dingy and tacky. The location of this restaurant was not the easiest to find until you arrived at the building. Saw a sign indicating Red Star is located on the 7th floor. There was an elevator next to it, I was horrified when I entered it. When the elevator door opened on the 7th, I had no words. After following the signs, finally got into the restaurant. Yes, the decor was stuck in the 1970s, but I still can deal with it. After we got seated, the male staff asked what kind of tea we would like. His mannerism started from indifferent to rude.I looked around at the table setting in front of me. My plate was greasy. My bowl was dirty and so was the soup spoon. By this time the male staff came with a pot of tea and a metal bin of cups lying in there. He just left them on the table and walked away. And yes, the tea cup I pulled out from that metal bin was dirty too. Anyway, guess we would have to pour our own tea. Then came the highlight which was the dim sum.This restaurant has probably the worst dim sum I have ever eaten in Singapore. Honestly I never have awful dim sum in Singapore, this special award really goes to Red Star.Just to highlight a few items : 1) Siew Mai (pork dumpling) - F - it looked unappetizing, there was no flavor to it, the meat tasted weird2) Cheong Fun with BBQ pork - F - zero flavor, and the BBQ pork tasted weird too3) Egg tart - F - it was fresh from the oven, but the crust too dry and the custard part has no tasteAnother female staff was so rude when my relative asked if there was any egg tart. She basically said if it was ready, it would already be out.Rude service, awful food and overpriced for this kind of dim sum someone actually has the guts to serve to patrons.  I say those who like the food here do not know any better. It doesn't matter this place has been around for a very long time, things that are old are not necessarily good.And not to mention, the air conditioning was almost non existent here. Any self-respecting Cantonese will never give this place any star beyond 2. I chose a 1 or none."

While dim sum here isn't the best you can get in Singapore, the entire dining experience here make up for it. To be honest, I've never heard of this place before until a group of friends talked about it and decided to bring me here for lunch last weekend.  Red Star is located on the 7th floor of a HDB flat (Block 54) within the Outram neighborhood. The restaurant is super retro - dim lighting, a center stage (for wedding singer or sort) and a huge main dining hall. The dining hall is filled with tables and chairs arranged in the most compact way to maximize the space, a common sight in any chinese restaurant.  We learnt that there are 2 ways to come up to the restaurant - one through the main door and another through the kitchen (back door). I think GOD knows that we're a curious bunch, the elevator we took lead us to the back entrance of the restaurant. We walked pass the kitchen, an oily walkway, through a few peculiar looking doors that says ""RED STAR THIS WAY"" before reaching the main dining hall. And then we saw the main entrance on the other side with people already queuing up trying to get a table during the peak brunch period. Lucky for us, another friend was there much earlier and already got a table when we reached. Service here is world class. Middle aged ladies with their headgear (like Emirates airlines) graciously push their cart to your table recommending and introducing different dim sums available for the day. They speak fluent cantonese and limited english but good enough to understand if you have any visitors or caucasian friend who cant understand mandarin or cantonese. I ""interviewed"" a couple of them and learned that they have been working here for the past 20+ years and take pride on their job. And with that I truly understand now that despite the average food, people still come back for its exceptional service as well as comfort food that's friendly to the wallet too.  Red Star is no where near any of the ""finer"" dim sum outlets we get in Takashimaya or 5 star hotels, but if you're looking for something different with a local touch, unpretentious, where you can talk and laugh as loud as you can then this place might be the right choice. I highly recommend this place."

Some of the trolley ladies don't holler out their wares, so you're gonna have to ask what they're hawking. I tried practically everything less the congee, and I have to say I am not impressed with the food. The rice rolls- argh. Too salty and dark a sauce. The siew Mai, forget it. The prawn dumplings had skin that was too thick and prawns within were unremarkable. The egg tarts had uneven levels of egg, and was really soso. I also tried the banana prawn fritter, and the skin was probably fried at the wrong temperature because it was oil-soaked yet not very crispy. The spring roll was dripping oil from it's too-thick skin. They also ruined my favorite dimsum item, the liu sha bao(custard bun), where  the bun was filled with a flowing custard that tasted of freezer burn! Other failures include the char siew bun, which had very little filling, was cold despite being in a steaming cart, and was awfully sweet. Just... weird. I don't know how this place survives. I don't care about the deco, I want my food. It cost about $50+ for two, but I feel it wasn't worth it at all. It was too expensive for what it was."

I am not too young to find the place smell of old people, neither too old to find this place reminiscence.Food. It seems time essentially kept the food tasting great ""just like old times""; both a compliment and a tinge of sarcasm. Compliment becos it still gives us a wonderful memory of the old HK dim sum taste like, and yet when the quality and evolving tastes has improved, this place has not. I am sure many of the customers have tasted better and more exquisite dim sum in HK and Singapore. But where can you find such reminiscence in this present day? Surely you can afford to pay for some historicity!Service. When compared to the other food places this has an army of people watching over our shoulders offering us the multitude of dim sum choices and the time to explain how each of them is special. Truely an experience only found in an old HK restaurant.The teacups came in a pot of hot water, just like old times. The pushers ( the people pushing the carts) is more varied; both old and young. It's not fair to keep those ladies working over 20 plus years thou some of them still do.New dishes. Apparently, they do add new varieties of dim sum, and have quite a number of ""newer"" deserts in their carts, those you can find everywhere else. They taste just like everywhere else so these I am not impressed! No historicity.Price. A bit pricey since we are paying for some historicity here, especially when you get to taste some of the old unchanged flavours dim sum in a old HK setting. Food is average. If you can get the ambiance and the historicity like me, those are the stars. If you want better food and a nicer modern ambiance with more cute looking or younger service people, leave the Q.Oh... The fragrance. I have to say something about the smell of food when I came thru the door. Suddenly I am reminded of the HK restaurant back in 1990 when I first met my HK in-laws! Yes.

Be sure to try the US roast duck, shark's fin with crab meat, fried garoupa in tomato sauce and their butter prawns, amongst some of their best offerings on the menu."

But all the better since it does make the food taste like victory! Be sure to arrive early since they don't take reservations for daily operations, and is one a first come first serve basis. There is usually a long queue that stretches all the way to the lift landing, so don't make the same mistake as I did, and arrive with a starving stomach, you won't be able to resist over ordering!  My staple dim sum dishes would be their fluffy egg tarts which are crisp around the edges and a soft pale yellow in the middle that looks healthy and non-artificial. The usual accompanying dishes would be siew mai, prawn dumplings with huge whole fresh prawns, and chicken feet if you can handle it! Their service really brings us back to the old days, where there are dozens of little Cantonese ladies pushing carts filled with goodies, going round table by table to serve you.

An experience to behold. It embodies the gaudy Chinese restaurants of your dreams (or nightmares). There's a certain charm to it.It's also an important piece of our food heritage. The people behind Red Star are also a part of the Heavenly Kings quartet, the four-some who redefined Chinese food in SIngapore (and some say Malaysia), by creating and inventing some of the dishes we now take for granted, like the yam ring and even the Chinese New Year yu sheng. It's a massive hall where people -- lots of people, and sometimes the occasional celebrity -- jostle for seats from the moment their doors open, especially on weekends. The stage that tells you you shouldn't attempt singing, on which so many of our parents' friends got married. The gaudy tablecloth. The dimsum trolleys.The food isn't great anymore.Especially considering the shift towards 'fine' dimsum, ordered off menus in restaurants far higher end than this.There's a tendency to automatically class this as ""kopitiam dimsum"" because it isn't the super refined Cantonese-style dimsum we've all gotten used to, and therefore say this isn't good.But it's still good. Especially considering how little you're paying for this, how authentically old school everything on the menu is, and what a funny, awesome, nostalgic experience it is to eat here each time. There was a period in 2010 or so when the food standard declined dramatically to the point of inedible, yes, but I'm glad to say that these old farts are back and their hargow and roast meats can out-heritage, if not out-class, all the wussy Crystal Jades and Imperial Treasures of the world."

As a kid, I enjoyed the fantastic delicacies they had. We stopped going there for a couple of years and my recent visit to Red Star was pretty disappointing. While the restaurant's age is showing through the dated decor, the old fashioned carts being pushed around by aunties serving Dim Sum still gives the place a nostalgic charm. The food, however, is no where near the standard of what it used to be. While the char siew sou is still pretty good with its buttery and flaky pastry with a moist, flavourful char siew centre, the rest of the Dim Sum we ordered did not impress. The standard of their pau (steamed buns) have dropped and the buns we got were rather stretchy and had a slight alkaline aftertaste. The siu mai just did not work for me. We ended up ordering congee to fill our tummies as we sort of lost faith in the dim sum there."

It is a traditional Chinese restaurant with traditional CHINESE service - rude and no manners. The food was terrible. So, I thought the staff were busy on weekends therefore provided bad service. My parents were visiting, so I brought them there on a weekday and get a second opinion. My parents did not enjoy the food, every dish was lousy. There were very few choices to choose from. THe worse part was, the servers were very political. THey condemned each other. When I wanted to order some fried dishes, this server said, ""It is not my department. You have to ask that lady. That lady is very grumpy. Don't order the fried stuff, they are not good."" in Mandarin. I got to walk to that lady to get her to come to our table. She was not serving any customer yet she was impatient while my parents making choices. In conclusion, we never went back there since 7 months ago. I will not recommend to anyone."

It has the feel of an old canteen, reminding me of those desperately-trying-to-look-old, kitsch cantinas so popular in Mexico City, with tiled floors, posters on the walls and vintage marble tables, a bit crammed on the inside. To the untrusting observer, The Tiong Bahru Club may appear to be one of those places where form is more important than essence. However, the environment ultimately works and the place feels strangely authentic and inviting.The first interesting thing are the two different menus: East Asian and North Indian. Both of them contained snippets of information, kind of ""explaining"" the dishes. We were told to choose what kind of menu we wanted to have, so we chose the Indian menu (I'm always keen on Indian food). We had a very good, fragrant and spicy fish curry. Then I tried the masala chicken liver, which was spectacular. It was rich in flavour, while at the same time full of subtle surprises. I could say food tasted almost home-cooked, there was a special level of care involved. There's no way I couldn't love that.It must be hard to keep the balance of style and substance in a restaurant. My first impression of The Tiong Bahru Club was that of a place favouring the former. It is always good to be proven wrong. Here, style is no more than the background to a sense-appealing meal. I will surely come back."

My friend's biryani was delicious too: light and fluffy, tasting of gardens.The outdoor seating was the perfect blend of the aircon from inside and the heat of the sidewalk, with people watching and a good breeze. Decor is cute and appealing - a blend of the club and the chaiwallah stand which both supply the place. The issue was that our server was quite obviously completely new and pretty inept (sorry, buddy, but you were.) He said they offered chai by the pot and let us order some - by the pot - but they only serve it by the glass, as the server who brought it over explained after our mystified glances at the solitary cup. He also said they were offering their Bento Box special but when I tried to order it, turned out that's only available on weekdays.

I know.. What's new right? Located at the corner of Eng Hoon St. And Seng Poh road, we've seen this place transform from an old coffee shop (our favourite Loo's Hainanese curry rice used to be here) transform into this upmarket eatery. At first glance, this place looked like just another upmarket, snooty diner, filled with expats, yuppies and a certain breed of Singaporean females that have a certain preference for guys I should not name. Anyway... What got us trying this place was the nostalgic feel and the fact that it did not serve the usual eggs Benedict, breakfast sets, waffles or pancakes, and they certainly didn't promote themselves as the next big coffee joint with magical beans from the bottom of the Amazon River. Instead, what this place specializes in is... Indian food and chai!! Surprise surprise! Well.. I guess it made sense considering that the Brits and the Indians / Sikhs have long had a history together. Anyway... I'm a sucker for indian food so this place, despite how hard I tried to say no, still got the better of me. They have 2 sets of menus here, an Asian menu, with fried rice and soto Ayam and an Indian menu. We decided to go for a Murgh Dum Briyani, my favourite Palek Paneer,a Masala Chicken Liver and what better way to wash down our food than with a nice pot of Himalayan Sikkih tea.First came the Briyani. A good sharing portion that could easily feed 2-3 pax. The rice was wonderfully fragrant with the spices and flavours beautifully infused in and the chicken, despite being the breast, was tender and oh-so-flavourful. So good in fact that it just might be one of the best Briyani's I've had in a while. Next was the Masala Chicken liver. Now this dish was the star of our lunch. It is literally to die for! The liver was nice and tender and the sauce, with all its onions and spices was amazing. Every bite was a dream and this dish is enough to bring us back for more. Finally the Paneer, my personal favourite. The sauce was nice and smooth without the spinach being over powering while the cheese was smooth and ""bouncy"". Only thing it could do with was a little more salt, otherwise it was another very good dish. The tea itself was nice and fragrant and proof that chaitime, the guys behind this restaurant, know their teas. Overall, it was s wonderful experience and the only reason this place didn't get a 5 is down to a few simple factors. A) indoor searing was a little tight, with most 4 pax tables nearly touching each other and effectively becoming a 3 top. B) service was slow as well, with the 2 waiters clearly being inexperienced and frankly a little lost most of the time. C) food did take a little longer than it should, with U.S. almost finishing our Briyani by the time the paneer came. D) the prices. A little on the strap side at around $20-$25 per pax for an Indian meal. Overall, I love how they kept some of the coffee shop's elements while updating it, leaving a nice nostalgic feel, down to the music choice. We'll definitely be back for more!"

Not familiar with the vibe which I guess is like an old timey coffee shop or harkens back to colonial times. Am always uncomfortable with that bc yeah it might've seemed cool but was not cool for the majority of those not in the elite. Anyhow it was cool enough in the evening inside and they had mixed chairs and cool wood floor etc. just be careful if ur inside and then you moved your chair back and one leg falls off the elevated floor and u could fall and hit ur head. The food was actually pretty good - the Indian food only. We had chicken not the spicy one and it was juicy and citrusy and delicious. Also had the Dahl and the baigan bartha and naan and plain rice and one more thing. But it was all tasty and very spicy but good. The service was meh. I asked for ginger ale and they said no we don't have it. I pointed out on the menu where it was listed. Was advised they don't have it anymore. Asked what on this list they had. They have juice and coke. There were five more things listed. Ok I'll just have water. Have to flag them down if you want anything so they don't check back. But at least they don't bother you and let u stay to chat. They're not clearing ur plates as soon as ur done which was my experience in most other restaurants in Singapore.

I went here on a friend's recommendation but either the management has changed or they were having a really bad night. The service was so bad it was comical. I don't see how any restaurant can charge prices like this when they offer such poor or no service. The menu prices were quite expensive.We struggled to get drinks. One waiter barely spoke English and when we did finally manage to order he would take an order  from 1 out of 7 people and disappear. We'd try to call the waiter back and he would take another order but forget half of the drinks. So we had to send our son to the bar to remind him. Then they ran out of beer. There was wine on the table but noone knew how much it cost.The food we had was OK but nothing to rave about. we only got a few entrees and this was only because my husband ordered them earlier as he had arrived 1/2 hour before  us. We had to get up and get our own plates as the waiters forgot.  After we had been in restaurant for 1.5 hrs we asked how our food was going and discovered the order had not been put through. The waiters were inept. We left as we'd run out of patience by then and everyone was grumpy.What was supposed to be a special birthday dinner was a disaster and I had 3 tired hungry children you feed at 9.30 pm.I've had better service in a hawker market for a fraction of the price!

As we were planning to visit another restaurant after this, we only ordered 2 dishes - both of which are my favourite ones here. We started the meal with a large plate of Drunken Cockles (S$20 / US$14.67). The juicy raw  cockles had been cured in soy sauce, Chinese wine, garlic and topped with some fresh chili padi (Thai chili). The copious amount of minced garlic imparted a lovely flavour to the dish but doesn't make for a good dish to indulge in if you're on a first date. Another signature dish here is the Curry Crab in Claypot. Even though it's been a long time since I ate here, the rich, creamy curry gravy was as good as I remembered. The flavourful gravy was a perfect complement to the smooth strands of boiled Beehoon (rice vermicelli). The medium-sized Sri Lankan Crab was succulent and so big, it was almost spilling out of the claypot! The Crab dish set us back by S$ 75.40 (US$ 55.28) before 7% GST & 10% service charge. The beehoon is priced at $5 (US$ 3.67) per plate, which though pricey is worth a splurge to be able to fully appreciate the flavourful curry gravy. If you stop by here and have a decent tolerance for spice, do order the Drunken Cockles and Sri Lankan Crab Curry."

I'm saying like the size of your face huge. Hidden away on a side street by Outram, it's easy to miss this restaurant among the various other zhi char stores nearby, so do come prepared with directions in hand. Open all the way from 11.30am to 11.30pm, many old regulars living in the area drop by for late night indulgences in their signature crab dishes, and I've seen many order crab to go as well. Their top selling dish is obviously the chilli crab, but if you're tired of the usual like me, do try their Butter Crab. It's served drenched in a thick creamy butter sauce, and lightly seasoned with crushed garlic for a plate of steaming fresh delicious seafood. The sauce is also lighter than the spicy chilli or heavy black pepper taste, so it's easier to allow the natural freshness of the crab to be picked up by your palette. This means you can actually appreciate the crab meat and not just the sauces. Their fried Man Tou (buns) are no joke either, dig in while they're hot to enjoy the crispy brown surface and steaming white insides. Dipping it in any of the sauces from the crab dishes just makes them a hundred times better! Price can range from about $30 to $50 per person if a large group for 4 - 6 are sharing 2 crabs, which is definitely more than enough!"

A homegrown favorite SPRMRKT has expanded and set up shop at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI) Creative Workshop & Gallery. I've walked past several times but only noticed their bistro concept SPRMRKT Daily. Little did i know that their Kitchen & Bar, which serves refined European food, is tucked away upstairs through a side stairway.The spot is absolutely gorgeous in the day with expansive views of the idyllic riverside. Lunch sets are offered, starting from $30, served with coffee or tea. They have also started their weekend brunches and we say grab a table now!For lunch, start with a simple but wholesome Brussels & Roots with a honey clove dressing. The vegetables are simply steamed- golden baby beetroots and baby turnips along with the Australian Brussels sprouts. The garden of greens is flavored with pops of umami from the slow-baked tomatoes seasoned with thyme, garlic, sea salt and olive oil.For lunch, go for a lighter Pan-Roasted Chilean Sea Bass. The fish is seared and basted with butter, then finished in the oven with a simple touch of salt, pepper, and lemon juice. A refreshing ratatouille adds a juicy crunch to the mix. We agreed with the chicken stock flavored polenta which was rich and velvety with some Parmesan sharpness.For dinner, the Firefly Squid ($24) surprised us with a bacon-like smokiness in the meatless cauliflower puree. I have no idea how but i'd take all the cauliflower puree as a guiltless replacement. The special firefly squid from Japan is intensely flavored, having been marinated overnight in soya sauce, sake, mirin and brown sugar. Definitely order the Octopus & Prawn ($24). This has to be one of the best (if not the best) Spanish octopus i've eaten this year. The octopus is simmered whole with mirepoix and other spices and white wine for 2 - 3 hours before grilling on a plancha. The crispy skin and that tender flesh were unforgettable.I didn't like the Fjord Trout ($19). I'm not sure if it's due to the way it's cooked- mi cuit style, sous vide with salt, but the flesh was mushy and powdery. The flavor was great, just not the texture. Fresh pasta are a must these days. If you like something really meaty, the Malbec Oxtail Pasta ($32) with a smoky Scamorza will satisfy. The oxtail is braised with Malbec (my favorite wine) to impart that berries, plum, and chocolate flavor. Perfect comfort food. Can i have another glass of Malbec to go with this please?A favorite at SPRMKT is the Smoked Lobster Tail ($42) which features a cold smoked and then seared Maine lobster with toasted garlic panko bread crumbs and a Mac n Cheese. The cheese sauce is a lot lighter than usual as they have added pumpkin puree to the Emmental, aged Parmesan, and Mozzarella mix. I absolutely love the Twice Cooked Chicken Roulade ($28). I've not had a chicken so good in a while. The juicy chicken thigh is brined overnight and then rolled with a creamy spinach and mushroom duxelle, before being cooked sous vide and then shallow fried for that amazing Peking-duck-like crispy skin. It's great on its own, with its own jus, or with the amazing curry cauliflower puree (seriously they are so good with their cauliflowers). I can go on forever about the other tender juicy red that is the Stockyard Côte de Boeuf ($94). This 200 days grain-fed 600g Australian bone-in beef ribs is good for 2. The ribs are first coated with a house made Creole spice rub before being seared and roasted. Drizzle a little of that beef jus made with roasted bones, red wine, tomatoes, and veal jus for some tart umami. The meat is served with mixed mushrooms, roasted rosemary tomatoes and vine-ripened tomatoes. Perfect date meal!End your meal with a fragrant and light Earl Grey Creme Brûlée ($16) scented with a lemon lavender streusel base and fresh seasonal fruits.For something rich and earthy, the Three Beet Chocolate Lava Cake ($18) delighted us with the medley of textures created with the versatile root. Of course, we cannot resist a 70% Valrhona dark chocolate lava cake. I wouldn't be surprised to see more of this beetroot and raspberry sorbet on the market. I'm already seeing a lot of beetroot on the menu of many noteworthy restaurants."

At first is a bit confusing, the name suggests a market, and they do sell a few (overpriced) fruits and vegetables, but it can also appear as a bakery, cafe, restaurant, takeaway or souvenir store. They seem to have a bit of everything.As a restaurant they have few tables outside where they serve an interesting menu. Ambitious might be the proper word to describe it. They have common dishes, mostly Western, but made with a slight, almost imperceptible, twist, mainly done by adding a touch of a different flavour, which lifts the plate. For example, the sweet potato fries come with a well-balanced curry mayonnaise. More importantly, the food I've had there a couple of times is done with care and precision. Prices seem rather high, but portions are on the generous side, so I think they're fair (it's Robertson Quay anyway). Burgers are big and delicious, and pasta is served in more than enough amounts. Mainstream beers are expensive at 10++ for a miserable half pint, but they have good craft beers at the same price for a bottle. Coffee is not bad, but nothing to rave about. Cakes are tasty, worth trying. An important thing is they make an effort in offering more local products rather than imports, maybe they could make that more explicit.Inside the shop, there are three tables that serve as a cafe, and there's a shelf that showcases souvenirs of the interesting kind, I'm talking about Singlish ""dictionaries"" and Teochew recipe books instead of Merlion keychains. While these quirky souvenirs are quickly becoming mainstream, they also sell books by Math Paper Press, which are truly good local gifts.SPRMKT has a little bit of many different things and, sometimes, it's not quite clear what to expect. It is, after all, a place to have a nice dining experience and find some amusing local products. It is worth a try, the food is better than it would seem."

However, we really enjoyed everything we ordered. The salad was ridiculously fresh with a good balance of cheese, capers, olive oil, and lemon. The grilled octopus was also very tender and flavorful. The fish was nice but a little on the dry side. We were tempted to try the fried Greek donuts and were glad we did. The six puffy yeast balls came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup and honey for dipping. It was not overly sweet or greasy. The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because the service was not as personable or friendly as one would expect for a typical cosy, charming establishment like this."

Once on a weekday, the other a weekend. There was an April only promotion - 50% off for 4 pax.My first visit, weekday lunch starts at 11am. So there were 3 of us and the promotion would not apply to us unless we bought a 4th pax and we would enjoy the 50%. The usual price was $48++ per person. And so we did as recommended by the manager.Peach Garden is located in the Amara Hotel in the Havelock area.. Parking here can be pricey if you come on a weekday. We parked some distance away off Chin Swee Road, in the residential area and took a short walk to the hotel.Once we sat down, we were promptly attended to. We ordered our tea and took a look at the menu. The promotion menu is on a piece of print out where one would be required to mark what we wanted.Our first dish was the deep fried Soon Hock (Grouper). The dish was excellent. Every part of the fish was edible, even the tail because it was so crispySoup: we ordered a mix of clear sharks fin broth & thicker version. Both were tastyAbalone & wasabi. This turned out a little disappointing. The salad was rather bland. There wasn't a key item for the eyes to feast on therefore killed the dish for me.Fried shrimp. Slightly oily but tasted great. Would've preferred lighter/less batterSpinach, tri-egg in broth. This dish is a must have.On my second visit being a weekend, there were 2-round seating, one being 11am, the other being 1pm. Therefore be aware you cannot sit leisurely for lunch.The menu had fewer soup items, and a few additional items. This time, the manager told me that the Soon Hock is not available. This was a huge disappointment because this time, we brought our grandmother who loves fish. And we had to order other fish dish.This time, everything was salty. The saltiest item we ordered was the spinach noodle in Mapo Tofu sauce. We returned it. What we ordered that we did not the other day were Indonesian curry shrimp. The shrimps were fresh. Flesh was tender. Curry base was tasty. Would've loved it better if some yew tiao were provided to soak up the sauce.Steamed PaTing fish, slightly fishy, but still quite good. sauce it was sitting in was good with rice.Herbal shrimp. This was so good, we each drank up all the herbal soup that the shrimps were sitting in.Deep fried fish skin. It was good but was a little soft by the time the skins were served.I would definitely come back again but will only do it when there's a promotion. Otherwise, it's just too expensive."

Most of the normal dim sum was on it. The most expensive item is the shark fin dumpling with abalone being S$20 per bowl. The rest of the items starts from S$5.80 onwards.Entrance from the car park goes directly into the dinning area. You have to make your way to the front to meet the maitre'd. Service after that was fast. The waitress asked which tea would we like but actually she only had one type, so why bother to asking? Chances of someone ordering the tea she carries is like 1 in 70 due to the number of tea combo there are. There were numerous occasions that the waitress brought us the wrong order, sure the restaurant was crowded but not full.We ordered the normal stuff, prawn dumplings, meat dumplings, chicken legs, steam pork rib, various buns, century egg and pork porridge, fried carrot cake and the $20 shark fin dumpling. Unfortunately the shark fin dumpling was not that good and does not worth the $20. The pork ribs was lean and so after steaming, it was really tough. The various prawn and meat dumplings was average. The char siew pow was above average and was the only item worth ordering. The century egg and lean pork porridge was rather expensive as it was like 7 spoons of porridge only. The carrot cake was also nice but it was $18 and comes with prawns.Overall the food is just average and it was rather expensive But hey this is a after all an hotel restaurant."

And yes, I was thrilled when I heard that we are going to try out the buffet here. On the lift, it has quite a few advertisements about the Laksa and some other foods but I did not really sink that in until I came to this cafe.Open concept dining - score. This so called cafe has also plenty of seats. Located on the 1st floor, you wouldn't probably miss this place. Was served by the waitress promptly to our seats. Like any other buffet style, I know that we can walk around and see the food first before getting the food. As a foodie, I took pictures of foods as well as the assigned chefs and update it on Yelp first. I started at the end corner where the international chef was serving ham and turkey. Got myself a honey baked ham. And there was other toppings for the turkey but I placed it on my ham instead. Took a couple of food types in small portions there and started circling the other stalls. I also took a piece of scallop. Like the ham and the scallop. Ham was soft and tasty while scallop has ingredients on it as well which produced flavorful taste.Next stall I went to was the Laksa store. After seeing the advertisement on the way to the buffet area, I was somehow imagining the taste and flavor just by looking at the ad. Yes yes!! My imagination and my tastebuds matched. A must try dish if you pop by here.Next station was the sushi station. Got myself quite colorful sushis (not sure about the names) but the difference are the ingredients. There was a sushi master cutting sashimi at that area too. Didn't really get it as I wanted to taste other foods. Sushi's rice wasn't well done and not as fresh as the seafood section.Next stop, soup station - clam chowder and piece of french baguette. Quite disappointed with the cold soup and cold french baguette. Was expecting it to be warm.Last of all, dessert! I tried most of the dessert for the day. There are two kinds of shots - raspberry and chocolate. Loved the raspberry one. The chocolate was too thick and I was expecting it to be like a chocolate mousse in the cup. The log cakes - chocolate: bitter and need to acquire the taste before indulging in more, fruity flavored: passionfruit mousse with shredded coconut was the perfect combination of all. Tried the raspberry mousse cake. Loved the texture and sour sweet taste in it. Ginger creme brûlée sounds weird but it was good but please avoid strawberry as it had caramel on it. Overall, I am very satisfied with the dessert section. There were ice creams with cones too at this dessert corner but was too full to gulp into more delicacies.Service was excellent - servers cleared the plate as soon as I placed my plate aside. Was quick in serving water when asked too. Overall, I am very satisfied with the buffet style in this cafe. Do try it when you are in the area!"
Cafe Brio’s,392 Havelock Road Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel lobby Singapore 169663 Singapore ,169663,1.29028193417518,103.835147954372,[],Li T.,dJzKwp5k65MK3R_qn4Xpow,"Singapore, Singapore",4,12/19/2014,"A giant 15 feet Christmas Tree greeted me when I stepped into the lobby. Making a detour around it, I spotted a familiar figure--Mr Santa--resting happily in the goodie house and surrounded by his old friends, Mr and Mrs Gingerbread Men. The cheery festive spirits at Grand Waterfront Copthorne Waterfront were highly infectious and they definitely pumped up my appetite to indulge in the Yuletide treats at Cafe Brio's. Here are FIVE REASONS why this is a great location to wine, dine and be merry!Reason No.1:SALADS I know most people would naturally dive straight into the oysters and sashimi but it would be a grave strategic error NOT giving their salads a chance. One never look at buffet salads the same way again after trying the tasty offerings such as juicy mushroom salad, fresh corns with lentil beans and even a ""heart-shaped"" Seafood salad constructed with lots of cured salmon cubes and cherry tomatoes for that bit of tart balance. And the deeply savoury Norwegion Smoked Salmon with horseradish cream? Yes, they are my salads too. Reason No. 2: LIVE STATIONWith hotels upping their ante to dish up fresh hot food ala minute, live stations are no longer a novel concept. But where in Singapore can one possibly have Australian meatballs at the Live Station?  And there's the famed superb Super Laksa here too. The fragrance of the coconut milk permeates the potent broth which is the key that makes it an arduous task to leave any drip behind. It must be a lot of hard work for the one-man chef who is tending the station; one hand busy boiling the noodles and the other hand cooking the tomato sauce. But fret not as the quality is highly assured. Reason No. 3: MEATSBuffet is always a game of chance where there are plenty of choices but the only way to sieve out the better ones is to try a little from each dish. One great thing is that Cafe Brio stocks up quite a few dishes for each meat category, which increases the probability of success. Take of example in my favorite fish category, there is Deep Fried Sichuan Fish, Atlantic Butter Cod, Fish Otah, Stewed Fish Maw, etc. What took my fancy was the Pan Fried Sea Bass that sat in a pool of creamy mushroom, scattered with pomegranate seeds that complemented the savoury dish splendidly. Reason No. 4: OUTDOOR GRILL Adjourn to the outdoor grill section where one gets different kinds of marinated meats hot of the grill. We tried the thinly-sliced beef whose juices are duly retained. Some options like the pre-grilled items like pork fillets or lamp chops resided in the buffet warmer but I think it's still best to go for those freshly grilled items.Reason No. 5: FRENCH DESSERTSAttention gravitates towards the dessert counter, where a spread of tantalizing treats created by award-winning Executive Pastry Chef Nicolas Maugard who has honed his skills at several Michelin-star establishments over his 17 years of pastry career. This year's highlight is the Vanilla Pineapple Roasted Confit, Coconut Biscuit, Mango and Yuzu log cake.  Don't wrong the cake if you couldn't detect any crunch as the ""Biscuit"" is not literally the biscuit, but a dacquoise layer that is saturated with fragrant coconut shreds. Each segment had its own sea of significance but they seemed to bumped corners with another in what seemed to be an arbitrary assemblage. The Raspberry flavoured Grand Marnier and ""Guanaja"" Chocolate Christmas Yule Log Cake is a comfortable partnership of flavours but I wished the Grand Marnier flavour could be more pronounced. Nonetheless, the texture of the chocolate mousse is astoundingly velvety, just like the excellent Panna Cotta which I had previously at Pontini. Freshly made on the spot, the golden waffles with crisp browned edges and a tender, not-too-sweet interior is also worth a spot in the limited stomach space. Highly flexible to go along with any savoury ingredients like smoked salmon or sweet creamy ice cream."

It was the hotel's signature and bestseller, Chocolate Truffle, and we were all impressed the simple, yet pretty presentation and the taste. There was a shiny ganache layer, with artfully placed berries. Digging into cake revealed two moist sponge layers sandwiched between light light chocolate mousse. Raisins could be found within the layers as well, adding a variety of textures. There was also an alcohol tinge to the cake, not sure if the sponge had been presoaked with rum, but it complemented the cake nicely. However, as with most mousse cakes, too much will lead to one feeling rather stuffed, especially with a strong flavour like chocolate."

There is local food such as satay outdoors, Japanese food, Western food and more depending on what is available on the day that you are there. I have been there a couple of times and am always glad for the choices. The food though is not exceptionally good but I think the hefty prices of $49 for Monday to Thursday nights and $59 for Friday to Sunday nights are paid mostly for the variety of dishes and ambience. One thing that is lacking though is the dessert options. There are perhaps about five choices and although the dessert changes from time to time, it is still quite limited.The ambience, as mentioned before, is the other thing you're paying for. The outdoor seating is near the river and makes for a serenely romantic backdrop for the evening, whether you are on a date or enjoying a meal with friends or family. In the cool evening breeze and the lovely setting, it is an ideal place to chat and eat a buffet meal slowly, in a relaxed fashion."

Everything was so beautiful. It was like eating little pieces of art. There were a lot more courses than listed on the menu.The flavors were very simple but their freshness made them distinct. I'm not going to describe every course since it would take forever. Plus the menu changes with the season so every time is a new experience. Instead, I'll just focus on the few dishes that impressed me.The bonito smoke with hay was my favorite. Bonito is a strong fish. The smoke lends itself well to the bonito without overpowering and creates a different texture.The maguro was magnificent. We were given the otoro and akami . The otoro is an overrated cut of the tuna. The akami is by far my favorite because it has more flavor and a better texture. Chef Yoshiyuki agrees.The kinmedai was very elegant. It's a type of snapper but fattier and more flavorful than a regular red snapper. Grilling was the perfect treatment for the kinmedai.The entire meal was beautiful but these dishes were great. Will RTE if possible."

Dessert was a wafer like ice cream and as a birthday treat, Japanese fruits and a Sakura mochi were presented. Yoshiyuki-San was very polite and quite friendly.

I've visited their outlet at terminal 3 before and surprisingly the food here seems a lot better! The only disappointment I have is that the portions can be larger for the price i paid.

Both were so good, and I loved every mouthful. The wonton mee is soft and smooth, the sauce not too salty and the wonton nicely cooked. The generous vegetables were a big plus. The sambal does not have much kick, though.The fishball noodles were slightly less salty, and the fish balls are bigger than others I have eaten- very soft and not chewy at all. I'll have it again next time!Their chicken rice is oiler than I like, so paying some extra cents and worth it, though, is their char siew chicken rice. My god, it is fantastic. The slices were a lovely red colour and moist, going perfectly with the aromatic white rice. Don't eat with the chilli sauce! It overpowers. The soup is excellent, one of the best I've had.The you tiao is something I will not miss. It's just too oily to the point I feel lipsticked with oil. Generally, the fried items are not so bad.Dig in- don't be bothered if its too much oil or salt. Ananas is just another reason to enjoy hawker food while it lasts. :)"

It's the de facto community art gallery of Ubin.Affectionately known as the ""two sisters"" coffee shop by regulars, the place is run by two sisters who were born and bred on the offshore island. An evidence of how well loved it is can be seen by the photographs that were all donated to the sisters by regulars that include many a professional photographers, and old timer islanders who have known the sisters since they were little. It doesn't get as authentic as this.Food wise, they serve up the usual ""chze char"" fare. The food is nothing to brag about but it's all in the service and homeliness of the coffeeshop that brings regulars back again and again.

Cozy Bistro & Lounge is equipped with, Pool Table x 01, Darts machines x 02 and Telecast soccer match on TV. Nestled in the Jalan Lokam residential neighbourhood, it is within reach of Bartley or Serangoon MRT stations.1. Crispy Prawn Twister 12.80- Served with celery and carrot sticks with tartar sauce. Probably one of my favourite snacks to munch on while darting. Definitely a fun way to eat your favourite fried prawns! Crispy and tasty!2. Lamb Rack $23.80 *Highly Recommended*- 3 bone premium lamb rack cooked together with garlic and lemongrass presented with green salad and stirred-fried potato; complemented with red wine brown sauce. This is probably why I would come back! The lamb rack was so juicy and tender. One bite and you'll be sold. A good mix of meat and fats, with some light seasoning, makes this so irresistible.  It was melt in your mouth delicious.4. Roast Beef (Pre-order only) $88.00The roast beef was very thickly sliced and cooked to a perfect medium; it was salty, meaty goodness. Sides were also good: salad with dressing was good and oven baked potato. - 600gms Roast beef cooked to order. Presented with garden green salad and oven baked potato complemented with black pepper brown sauce.6. German Pork Knuckle (Pre-order only) $55.80- ""Chef Specialty"" presented with garden green salad, homemade mash potato and thai chilli sauce. Crispy on the outside pork knuckle skin and juicy and meaty on the inside. This is great for a party of 4 or more! It's huge! The homemade mash potato was a nice discovery, it was flavourful and savoury. I would definitely consider ordering this for a cool boys night out!Other dishes such as the Mushroom Aglio Olio was a tad spicy for me and tasted slightly bland for my taste. But again here, Cozy Bistroy & Lounge is extremely generous with the amount of mushrooms served!There is a current promo for CarlsBerg Beer $60.00 for a Tower or $25.00 for a Jug.Overall : Do stop by Cozy Bistro & Lounge for a fun night out without hurting your wallet! Prices are nett and you have gotta try the Lamb Rack $23.80,   German Pork Knuckle (Pre-order only) $55.80 and Crispy Egg Seafood Noodles $10.80."

That said, it was competently done with thin skin and crunchy shrimp filling. Siew Mai - same feedback as the Har Gow. Malay cake - fluffy soft and not too sweet. Wu Kok with Chili crab filling - interesting.

He is quite friendly and offered to pick the sauces to be mixed and I gladly accepted. I don't know how to describe the dish but it has a lot of ingredients.

I love to have my lor mee with the thick bee hoon and lots of chilli, vinegar and garlic.The aunty has a pleasant personality and even though i requested for a lot of things she didn't seem to be angry at all, some stall folks would get angry as it is different from the usual order.

There is a particular Nasi Lemak stall called Yi Liu Xiang that is an old time favourite of mine. They have such awesome chili and ikan bilis that I can just eat the rice with those two ingredients alone.Parking is pretty readily available in the adjoining multi-storey carpark.

Parking is plentiful (depends on timing though) and an easy walk from Kovan mrt and bus station. I love the soup which is very tasty, and full of vegetables. The small is sufficient for 2 persons. I find the cheaper fish (garoupa?) has more bones than the pomfret, but it is more flavorful. It also has slices of yam in the soup. The prawn paste chicken wings is a must order. Just so yummy. Sambal sweet potato leaves are equally good."

I normally frequent the tian wai tian at ang mo kio, but since I was going bowling at jForte my friends decided to grab dinner here on a rainy sunday night.At around 730pm, the place was packed. there was a queue to place zichar orders. All the tables were occupied and you would've to wait quite a while for an empty table. Even when we got a table, it took another 10-20 minutes before the table got cleared and cleaned. My recommendation is make a reservation, so that you have a clean table and the reserved tables are on the other side of the coffee shop which is more airy and windy. I say at the side facing the bus interchange, there wasn't much air crossflow.1. Fish head steamboatWe ordered a medium and my friends complained that they coudln't find much fish in the steamboat. There were 5 of us and yes some pieces were miniscule and some were half the size of an iphone 6S. The fish was decent, it wasn't MSG ladden as I didn't feel too thirsty after the meal. The soup was served with vegetables and seaweed. I loved the seasweed. The soup was refillable, but it is self-service.2. Prawn Paste ChickenTheir prawn paste chicken never fail to meet my expectations. I love them! They are so crispy on the exterior and juicy and tender on the inside. They aren't too oily but they sure are sinful! The chicken wings are also pretty plump. 3. Egg FuyongThe egg was pretty oily but they were generous with the ingredients, lots of prawns, carrots and some meat in the egg. The aroma of the egg was pleasant and even though we ordered a small portion, it was more than enough for the 5 of us. 4. Salted egg porkThis was the only disappointing dish we ordered. The pork was dry and I could barely taste the salted egg. The salted egg was also barely visible on the pork. Skip this dish5. Sambal Kang KongThis was drenched in oil! I ended up washing the kang kong in a bowl of fish soup before eating it as there was just too much sambal oil on the vegetables.For 5 of us, we paid $79, at $16 per pax, our tummies are filled with zi char food and we were all satisfied. But I'll definitely go for sweet and sour pork rather than salted egg pork the next time round.Overall : don't expect any service, since you're not pay any service charge or GST, make a reservation before heading down, and do give the fish head steamboat a try."

Oh man, it definitely hit the spot.  For the ribs, they were literally tender fall off the bone, the way real ribs are intended.  For Roasted Cauliflower, never was really a fan before, but after trying this for the first time it opened my world and now i'm try to figure out how can i make this at home. Once you try it, you'll know why. The ambience is more of an informal bar type setting. It's great for casual eating with friends but not so much a date spot.

I came with another friend to try the Hokkien Mee here. It took a while (at least 10 mins) for it to be ready and we ordered right when it opened (we got there before 10 am, and waited for it to open). So I do not know how long it will take if you order during peak period. The noodle was tasty. It was not too wet or dry. My friend said she could smell the prawn stock wafting from the plate. I liked it but I was not overly wowed. Maybe no lard (or not enough lard) -- I could not remember if it was there. It lacked the umami or rich taste of a nicely fried Hokkien Mee with plenty of wok hei flavor. Still, it is a good place to try.

My father will usually Da Bao a pack of 10 piece of meatball for my brother for snack. They are really tasty despite being on the oily side.What I don't like about the stall is that the noodles portion are really little, and most of the time I won't be full after eating.

(Brunch dishes - they're just eggs y'all!) I suppose when youngsters (and older, aka me) started turning up at cafes in droves with their laptops and staying for hours.At least with Regroup, I didn't feel too bad parting with $17 for my squid ink linguine (4 stars). For starters, it had soft shell crab in it. While the crab wasn't as delicately crispy as others I've had, the garlicky, spicy sauce was right up my alley. Typically, I feel like I order squid ink pasta more for its unique colour (I'm a sucker for green tea and pistachio flavoured items because of their gorgeous colours. Heck, I swear it was the wildly unnatural, beautiful lilac skins of yam baos [taro buns] that conned me into consuming far more of them than is probably advisable). But this time, the linguine itself seemed to be that much more flavourful. Warning: Don't eat this before an important presentation or risk looking like a toothless pirate.Tried some of my friend's truffle mushroom soup (4 stars) - it didn't taste creamy and wasn't salty. She found it a bit bland though. Also had some of her goldrush waffle (4 stars). The waffle was somewhere nicely between being soft and crispy, the dark chocolate ice cream was solid, and the honeycomb crumbs were a nice touch. The salted egg sauce was good, but it's not my thing to begin with. I had a single scoop of ice cream and the girl at the counter very nicely agreed to do 2 generous half scoops for me, making it $4 well-spent. Their pistachio (4 stars) is definitely one of the better ones I've had. The stout butterbeer (3.5 stars) had a good flavour but melted too quickly.Besides the food, I love the decor of the place (5 stars). It's spacious, brightly lit, and minimalist. They also have 3 fans going in addition to the air-conditioning - I'm guessing because the large windows make it fairly warm in the day. It was pretty empty on a weekday afternoon, and I got some studying done. Note that there's no wifi available. I see their pistachio latte, smoked salmon salad, and a good book making a perfect afternoon in my near future."

They do latte art. Flavour wise, it's on the safe side and even slightly on the bland side. But the nearest decent coffee at a walk is Wheeler's Yard but that place you'll probably have a much longer wait albeit tastier cup. 3.5 for the coffee.Waffles take quite a prominent spot on the menu but we were in the mood for some salt so we ordered the truffle fries. I have to say the fries were not very good. Firstly they are thick cut but more importantly the oil seemed a little over-used and the insides weren't fluffy..like the fries were a little old. Simple dish that a lot of places sell and make good margins on, so it was an unpleasant surprise that it was subpar.I do like the atmosphere of the place. It's laidback. Kudos for the cool stylish tap for getting your own water. Other than that, it doesn't stand out that much. It doesn't have the charm of the Duxton flagship I would say.I was there on a Sunday morning before 11am and the place was nearly empty.They don't have parking so maybe it appeals more to residents. I have a friend who stays round the corner and I actually drive by weekly but the fact is, I've only been in once..so that is saying something. If I need a coffee and can be fussed to park at my friend's condo and walk. But if I were gonna drive to drink and I'm not crunched for time, I would head over to Old Hen for a bit more life and vibe and taste.Icecream here is rich and sweet. Some almost too sweet for my taste but it's quite creamy and should please be a crowd pleaser. I'll try the waffles when I come back next time and see if it warrants an update!"

I'm enjoying a morning breeze on a idyllic Sunday morning with my loved ones.I ordered a Farmer's Platter and a ice cold Mocha for myself and a traditional Egg Benedict for my wife. The Farmer's Platter had a good mixture of meat (bacon, European Sausages and beef patty) and a good albeit small toast plus a nice serving of mushroom ragout! Overall, the food was good but the beef patty could have been a little overdone. Maybe next time I would ask for the beef patty to be not overdone. The mushroom ragout was good! Slightly creamy and mushroom was just nice and soft. The Traditional Egg Benedict has a nice poached egg on top of the English Muffin. When sliced, the egg yolk was flowing down on to the muffin and it made it looked even yummier. I would recommend this place due to the sea front setting and especially when there is a cool breeze blowing towards you. Ask for the outside seats, you will not regret!"

Half an hour after one cocktail comes in, the waitstaff will tell you that there isn't the other drink you've requested for. Iced water arrives about an hour after you're seated and should you have an extra friend come in mid way, then it's too bad. You're going to have an extra serving plate and cutlery 15 minutes before you finish your meal. But not before you request for the same items four times and then resignedly nick it off another table. Food is just ok. Sure, the crabmeat linguine is good. But Italian isn't really that complicated to execute. The Buffala pizza came drowned in cheese, so much so that the cheese pooled bathtub-like at the base, leaving the edges dry painted with tomato. The mushroom fettucine was reported to be unfresh, and the sauce gritty because the fungi hadn't been washed properly. On the upside, the ambience is nice. And especially romantic if you're looking out to the sea. Although.. While I was there, there was fighting at the nearby construction site. Which kind of adds to an ambience of a different kind. Gritty romance anyone?"

We ordered the unagi and foi gras appetizer and quickly discovered that the pairing did not work well. The entree we did manage to get was the duck confit and, although judged premade (due to the speed in which it was served), the taste was fine.

The drink was bottle version, available off the shelf.Ordered the dry version of the noodle and it was pretty disappointing. The noodles was lumpy and had quite strong alkaline taste from the lye water. Pretty washing the noodles in the small broth that served with the noodle, but only slight improvement. The wantons were slightly more salty than preferred. Overall it was a terrible dish which was pretty different from the usual dish which was served in other outlets.Deep-Fried Mango Prawn Roll (S$3.20++/ 2pices)Although this dim sum could be found in other outlets but the version was very different from other outlets. The version here was full of mayonnaise but barely able to taste the mango in it. I would prefer the version from Crystal Jade Dining In which was full of chucky mango.Assorted Trio Har Kau (S$4.80++/ 3 pieces)The dim sum looked pretty colourful in red, orange and yellow and tasted not bad with the skin not too thick.Overall it was a disappointing meal.

If you are not already  familiar with them, they have 3 different dining experience, the so-called Nihon Mura Izakaya, Mihon Mura Bento Sushi and the one here, fits the Kaiten Sushi notion - conveyer belt sushi. I rarely visit any of the outlets but last week, I decided to give it a try, after all, I need to find a place for my dinner and trying to skip ALL Chinese/French foods!!  So, this one here, seems to fit the bill - a quieter dining room plus its a Japanese fare!I guess the draw is - the affordable price tag plus that promotion currently rolling out. The colour plates are going for $1 each if you ordered 3s. But strangely, they don't seem to fill up the conveyer belt, nothing has been replenished and the moving platform looks empty and cold. Weaned me from wanting to eat more, I should be happy for the reduced appetite, but at the very least, please refill the belt to make the dining room looks more ""normal"" when you called it ""Kaiten Sushi"" eatery. It appeared so pathetic and everyone will have to take the hassle to order from the menu, manually. Defeat the idea totally.If you asked, let's do a quick honest review.. before I lost that inspiration again (btw, I have always been truthful lol).The usual pick, Inari sushi - nice and soft cooked vinegar rice  plump up the fried Tofu pouch like a coin-filled money sac. These tofu skin has a subtle sweetness in them, not overly candied and it was moist and cushy. I always opt for plain ones, to get a real taste of the basics. I hardly give chance to one that are stuffed with fanciful kani or  Salmon roe.. a simple good Inari sushi is one that will make my day. And these, yes, they did somehow ... plus its a dollar for 2!? A steal.. if you are not fussy over anything.The Chawanmushi is passable though I find the taste in the custard a little too harsh in the seasoning. I like the egg custard to arrive on my table, having a balanced flavour. The mirin was found domineering the poor soy sauce fella, I didn't quite understand the sweet egg dish in the tea cup though the chicken chunks were juicy and tender. I won't need a sweet dessert in between my mains..  The chilled soba was the worst I ever tasted. The one here, served in a bamboo tray was far from meh = Meh meh meh!! AVOID!!  It looks weirdly painted in some sort of a alien green, I hope I am not loading myself with chemical paints but the critical part is, the noodle was hard, I can't match it up with the proper ""al dente"" term, it wasn't any close. However, I am glad that  I have less to complain on the tsuyu dipping sauce.To make it up, the Ebi and Yasai Tempura was some fresh vegetables, mostly root plants with 3 shrimps. The lotus root tempura was the most chewy and stoned, while the rest was causing less exhaustion on my jaw-muscles. They were fresh but less crisp on the fried batter. $6.90 for that stack was reasonable, given the ""teaspoon-length"" shrimps. Then I went on to order a plate of Sakura Ebi Age Maki, again this fall under the $1 promotion. Never mind about the  micro-tag, it won't influence my review anyhow =) I wished this fried maki has been perfect, the light batter turn out having a loud greasiness in each bite. The honeyed Sakura Ebi wasn't entirely inferior in taste, the way it looked. The maki has a mixture of  some Kani, Tamagoyaki morsels, seaweeds - very flavourful except the less favourable greasy exterior. Maybe they should properly drained them or use a blotting tissue to fight the stubborn diesel?!!? I will have a hard time considering if the plate was to cost me $3.48 at its usual. $1 for that, I will have to try to digest with a faint smile then...It's probably a good place for a weekend family session, if you are not particularly coming for the authentic flavours. The tags are smaller than most Japanese sushi outlet but think twice for those who can't accept misfired items."

Teh also just so-soIt was quite cheap and really much more reasonable than the rip-off Teochew porridge just down the road.They also sell porridge in the same stall too though.

There's always a long queue out the front, so despite the inconvenience of getting there, I made a trip down to check it out.The curry chicken wing was tender but somewhat bland, so I didn't really like that. The pork chops were a little dry, but it was pretty tasty. I liked the cabbage, and stewed fatty pork. They were both perfectly cooked till there was a nice balance between the tenderness and chewiness. The minced pork ball was probably the best item I ordered. It's firm and springy as you bite into it, and very juicy. Full marks for flavours and texture, none for presentation though! There are also a lot of other things to choose from, but that's all I ordered. It's open from 6pm till 5am in the morning. There's a queue even at midnight! But don't worry, they are really fast and efficient. The queue moves quickly.It's located in its own kopitiam space, so lots of space for seating. Parking in that area isn't too bad later at night, but if you're going earlier, you may have to park further away and walk over."

The wasabi that came with the sushi was also pretty tasteless and not as 'spicy' as it is supposed to taste like.My friends had actually ordered other dishes like their chawamushi and bento sets but all were of average standards and we were actually paying for restaurant standards, really not worth any cent of it.

I've always been a huge fan of conveyor belt, 100jpy/$1 sushi.. and today was the opening promotion for the Seletar Mall sushi express. Located on the second floor, behind the escalator, the restaurant has a strange layout, in which they fully maximize the shop space with every seat facing the conveyor belt. It might look a bit claustrophobic, as I had initially thought it was.. but after awhile, you are so consumed by the sushi going around you, that you completely forget that the shoulder of the next person beside you is literally inches away from you.Nonetheless, the sushi was fresh! Thick salmon sashimi slices, ikura gunkan, jellyfish, you name it! To be honest, I haven't really had a lot of experience with high end sushi, but hey,.. if the sashimi melts in your mouth like it did when I was in Japan, it works for me too! I really liked the sweet shishamo fish, can't tell if it came out of a can or not, but hey.. 3 pieces of pregnant fish for $1++ works for me :D it's kinda sweet, so hot green tea came in handy!Green tea is free, unlike nihon mura .. so.. wash down all that omega 3, protein fish with hot green tea, the hot water dispenser is available every 2 or 3 seats, so you're never more than an arms' length away from getting hot water. Desserts, there's a variety of desserts, like pudding, cheesecake, cream puffs, chocolate cakes, mochi.. and even collagen jelly packet drinks! I didn't have stomach space to try their desserts, but definitely wanted to try their pudding in the cup, which had what looked like blueberry jam on top of the pudding.. or maybe it was yogurt? I don't know, it was readily available,  I watched it circle the conveyor belt once, and it was never replenished, but I was also too distracted looking at salmon slices floating around too.."

A plate of lettuce come together with the Chicken and you may wrap the chicken in lettuce.

NOT mind-blowing or mouthwatering.My friend ordered a Plum beverage of some kind aka Ampla Juice ($4.95) while I opt for a Root Beer beverage that evening.  Thankfully Penang Culture is Halal Certified by the MUIS.I may return to another location of Penang Culture and perhaps order some other items in their Menu in which I want to try.  Perhaps from there, my review might differ.Yet another establishment that DO NOT ALLOW separate checks when time to settle the payment.  *DOUBLE SIGH*Penang Culture at White Sands is opened DAILY from 11:00 - 22:00hrs.Penang Culture @ White Sands Pasir Ris1 Pasir Ris Central Street 3,#03-21, White Sands Shopping MallSingapore 518457Tel: 6585 4877gdgroup.com.sg/penang-cu…"

The sides they offer are pretty decent as well, but be careful to not over order, as I have a tendency to do so. 2 large pizzas are really filling and can easily be shared by a group of 4 or more.

I love their mashed potato and Cajun fries in particular. They are more spiced and flavored as compared to those sold at other fast food chains that either taste too salty or too pepperish. A variety of burgers are also available here if you do not fancy chicken.One thing that I do need to point out is that there are several schools around Downtown East, so it tends to get crowded with schooling people on weekdays."

Traditionally, salted fish is added in for a smoked fragrant. It might look intimidating to some because it looks like a piece of stale meat. The claypot rice is really good! The chicken & chinese sausage portion is generous, in comparison, the few strands of choy sim on top of it looks pathetic. Anyway i think its for plating purpose. If you would like to add more vegs, they have many choices on their menu. We had nai bai with fried enoki, tofu with prawn & salted veg duck soup. The veg & tofu are ok.. I didnt like the salted veg duck soup. Its too salty for me & doesnt go well with the rice. It should go well with plain rice. There isnt a crowd during lunch.

On its own or with pasta. And cheaper than other restaurants. Often there are interesting daily specials. I also order takeaway puccia. It's their inhouse made bread stuffed with cold cuts, tomatoes, tuna and chilli. I don't usually go for canned tuna but this combination just works, helps that it's served hot and crops. In fact we often order this to share and have there with other mains as it comes cut into 4 full pieces. Small selection of deserts but the tarts are always good. Only one negative.

Service and decor is good. I ordered the special pasta and it was delicious!! My husband got the lasagna and it wasn't hot enough in the middle, I think they didn't heat it up enough so the outside was really hot but the inside was cold. This and the fact that they served water in plastic glasses is what made me drop 2 stars. Other than that the seem to have a good happy hour deal so I might be back for that."

We tried a variety of things, from their porridge, to chili crab pasta, spam fries, big breakfast etc. Nothing spectacular. For an iced coffee that costs $6, it came in a plastic takeout cup.

The manager and server FIfi are a service team of a calibre we haven't seen anywhere else in Singapore in our two years of eating our way around the red dot. The rest of the staff however are not very useful so if you pick a night when the manager is off duty it will not be the same. The food quality is good. It's casual Italian bistro food with good pizza options, pastas and salads. They do fresh juice juice and they do have a wine list though it could use a little help from someone who knows their wine. The day time scene is very different, they convert the restaurant into a cafeteria style place where you line up and dishes arrive at tables at random.

He took my order of Salad Prawns (which price was indicated as SGD15.00 on their online website).When I picked up my order of prawns, the restaurant charged me SGD42.80 (not including GST yet) for 1 order of Salad Prawns. I was flabbergasted as it was thrice the price that was listed online! When I questioned Ah Leong, he claimed that the price indicated online was meant for the Ang Mo Kio branch and that the prawns used at River Valley was far superior than that used in AMK, thus costing thrice the price.He was very aggressive and said that if I could not afford it, I could request for a refund and was extremely vocal about it, attracting attention from other customers. I was embarrassed, paid and left in a huff.I was surprised yet again when I returned home and opened my box of prawns because there were only 5 pieces of prawns, each no more the length of my little finger, coated with layers of flour. That means that each prawn costs about SGD9.00.

We had half roasted and half boiled Hainanese chicken. Both was nice with moist succulent chicken meat, but the roasted had a slight crispy skin. But if I was to choose a favourite then it has to be the boiled version.Although Boon Tong Kee is popular for their Hainanese chicken, I found there are many other dishes that are also nice. One of these dish is the crispy cereal prawns and one I do recommend to order. The prawns were massive and were definitely jumbo prawn. It was messy to eat but it was delicious.

So, do be careful when you order and check the prices so you know what you are getting yourself into!  That said, my everyone was very happy about the chicken rice."

I was quite happy with the quality of the rice here, but i would have to give a slight edge to Tian Tian, who's rice is slightly more fragrant and has better texture as well.other factors - no chicken innards is a ""no good"" from me. the place is air conditioned which is a huge plus relative to typical hawker center fare."

The poached chicken is typically juicy, though if like me you don't fancy a super strong chicken flavor, the chicken breast is better - ask for only that. BTK's rice is great, full of flavor and with a hint of pandan that makes it quite special. The real gem are the sauces - BTK's trademark red chili sauce and the sweeter brown (Hoisin?) as also the fresh ginger paste make for the magical Singapore chicken rice taste - each on its own, or in any combination with the chicken and the rice! Yes, freely mix n match what is on your plate - for an equally delightful result do what you may!It is the average service, erratic stocking of even chicken, and a mediocre set of alternatives that take away a star from this rating.

The white chicken tastes good, with their potent chilies. What a pity that this restaurant does not serve chicken rice soup, which is complementary in other chicken rice stalls & restaurants. You would have known that their mini fried tofu that comes with wasabi sauce is great like a snack or side dish. Another dish that I like over here is the spinach with 3 different types of eggs. I would say they have a not too bad rendition of this dish that I really like. Apart from the queueing at times and sharing of tables, I wouldn't mind coming here more for my dinner fix. ;)"

How scared?- Like being in a demonic nightmare you can't awake from- Like jumping out of a plane only to realise you forgot to take the parachute- Like being chased by a hungry cheetah and you're wearing thongs(In Oz we call this being sh!t scared! OR wearing the brown underpants!)Why am I scared? It all stems from my youth, when as a horrible child I got up to all sorts of mischief, which resulted in being disciplined (on the knuckles initially), by my mother - using a long wooden spoon. My naughty nature was such that she got so adept at using the thing she could hit me with it from another room, around walls, and over her shoulder without looking.So why bring all this up? Well... back in the day my mother lived in Singapore, and one of the dishes she brought back to Australia was char kway teow. It remains one of her favourite dishes to this day. Now I have grown up on her version of this dish, and totally loved it for years myself, so upon coming to Singapore I was interested in seeing how authentic her version was and if I found one better would I once again incur the wrath of the wooden spoon?Cue: No. 18 Zion Road Char Kway TeowThis was also my first hawker centre visit, so I was interested in the concept itself.Upon arriving I walked past endless stalls which only had 1 or 2 customers lining up for their food until I arrived at stall 18. Kaboom, a good 15-20 people lining up. Had I timed my run too late? I knew that it was closing at 3pm, and I'd gotten here at 2:10pm thinking I'd have enough time... As the line slowly progressed that time was running out, but then as if like magic, a big pile of orders were delivered at once and I was served probably 20-30 minutes after getting into the line (maybe quicker).The serving sizes are Small ($3.50 used to be $3), Medium ($4) and Large ($5).The glutton in me will pick the largest size 9 times out of 10 but I decided to be pragmatic here and opted eventually for the medium size.It was the right choice. The medium is a big enough serve for a hungry man, and given that char kway teow is quite heavy on the calories it's probably the best one to go for in terms of bang-for-your-buck-and-keeping-healthy balance.What I really loved seeing, when it was finally my time to order, was a photo of the cook/owner stuck alongside his grill. It had to be from 25-30 years ago. And for him to still be doing this, and churning out the same dish endlessly shows a real passion for the product.When I had the dish in my hands I made my way to a spare table in the centre and took a seat. Whilst I let the aroma of the dish invade my nostrils, the upbeat crappy but totally catchy Ronan Keating played over the speakers, followed by Owl City. I think it was important to mention this, because you feel good here. You feel somewhat light-hearted, and I think that is a great feeling to have on a weekend after work, just a carefree sort of afternoon with a nice meal.So what's the verdict Dan? Was it better than your mums? Here's the stickler. I'm loathe to say it was, for fear of that wooden spoon (or even never having the dish again) - but it was somewhat different in both flavour and texture.18 Zion introduce a generous amount of fresh cockles into the dish, and these juicy sweet bursts of flavour really cut through the richness of the dish, which I think is important as it can be quite rich. The pork lard crackling is an element I have never had before and it is exceptional, when you bite into one of those crunchy croutons of bacon-ness you are transported to flavour town.They also use a much darker thicker sauce, and the lap cheong whilst prevalent is diced much smaller than I'm used to - in such a way that it incorporates into the dish and is not something you identify separately - which is a key difference because it really rounds out the flavours.I loved this dish it was so flavourful and it is easy to see why it is considered one of Singapore's best exponents of CKT. However, I am also mindful that a dish like this is calorific - CKT sits at #6 for most calories in Singapore's Top 50 hawker foods with a whopping 745 calories based on a standard plating size - That's close enough to 3 Big Macs (257 cals each) to put it in perspective. If CKT wasn't so heavy on the calories I'd probably eat here very often."

Mr Ho's attention to detail is second to none.  I had the privilege of being the first person in the queue, and I watched for 15 mins as he made final preparations before they opened.  Adjusting where the eggs would be, where the noodles would be, the angle of his stock pot.  And then the final moment, when he dons his cap (backwards) and then turns on the light to the stall.  We're open!A little known fact that might miss a few.  Being first in line has it privileges.  One of them being, whilst the rest of the stall is being prepared, in the wok is actually a whole wok-full of lard being fried.  And so that first batch of kway teow, amazing!"

With this said, I truly enjoyed this meal.  Obviously one does not come to an establishment expecting large portions but his made me cherish every biteAs is typical, I was challenged to make my selections because everything looked so good.I started with the roasted eggplant and red pepper soup which was quite good. However, I have a feeling the classic French onion would have been a better selection.For my main course I selected the wagyu tenderloin topped with pan fried foie gras (which melted in my mouth with every bite). My largest disappointment comes in what I did not order. After eating I realized there was one more item in the specials that I'm sure would have been excellent. It is white asparagus season and it is flown in fresh in from France - I love white asparagus!For dessert I chose crème brûlée which was also quite good.  My only critique is that the serving was quite thin.  As a result, the sugar overpowered the very tasty vanilla creme. The same portion size would have been fine had it  been in a smaller but deeper serving cup."

Outstanding was the gravlax. Unfortunately it's not always available. The escargot was a disappointment with bits of grit. The mains were all very good. Best was the confit of suckling pig belly. Which was crisp and meltingly tender. Again preorder if you want this as this sells out fast. We finished with a brace of desserts, all well done. Overall a very nice dinner.

So I would gladly eat the one here again.Daily special of butter poached pink trout - so so good. the trout is deboned and so succulent and tender. Perfectly cooked and not dry. Add the french beans and toasted almonds, it has a wonderful combination of taste and bite. Love this dish!Daily special of mussels in white wine sauce - the white wine sauce is great, very flavorful and a good amount of wine taste, garlic and many other goodies.

There were dim sum with chicken and shrimp so I did not have to miss out because of pork. The Japanese area was my favorite: tofu hijiki salad, cold soba and udon, dashimaki tamago, and then...behold....rice with toppings and ONSEN TAMAGO!

The portion was very small and I guess was meant for one instead of two.  I did enjoy the salad and it was very good.  We followed that with the miso chicken, sesame togarashi and shishito peppers and the steamed atlantic cod, prawns, clams, kaffir lime leaves. Both dishes were amazing as everything melted in our mouths.  Truly well done.The second night, my family and I ordered lobster and pork chops for four to share.  Both items were cooked to perfection and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The shared lobster also came with two sides which we asked for garlic mashed potatoes and Wild Mushroom sides.  I must admit it was an excellent meal.As for service, it was very attentive and professional.  I thoroughly enjoyed the service by a specific waiter.  I did not get his name but he was a taller stocky fellow who made excellent recommendations.  I would not give them five stars but they were definitely headed in that direction.  A great special events location."

I adore their Sunday brunch with its freshly shucked oysters and meat grilled to perfection, and its martini bar where the alcohol was poured into an ice sculpture where it traveled before reaching the glass so as to keep it chilled. I am not sure if this is a standard feature every Sunday or just that time. Pretty cool to watch even if you don't drink. Food is fresh and service is attentive. I also love its lunches. It has become my new favorite place for a relaxing bite in the afternoon. Besides the a la carte dishes, you could do the mezze lunch - appetizers and dessert buffet (small but comprehensive) or with a choice of mains. The main portion is not huge so it is quite a good addition if you want more meat or seafood in your meal. The staff check on the buffet selection very often so it is replenished very quickly.The Buffalo mozzarella with fresh tomatoes are awesome, likewise for the salmon dish (don't remember the name) where the salmon is so tender it can melt in your mouth.

This latest instalment features a main course and buffet spread of appetizers and desserts at an unbelievable price of only $58++!! Buffet sounds highly inviting but the showpiece is the main course that comprises a selection of wood-fired steaks and seafood, grilled over apple wood at more than 200 degrees Celsius in temperature. Some of the mains require additional charges but they are very worth the extra bucks. Take for example the Rack of Lamb from Australia that truly exemplifies the skills of Chef Owen who is a master at handling tricky cuts. The marinade is nothing fancy, but the meat is superbly succulent and tender, as if I was slicing a raw eggplant.The pastry team seems to know the cacao bean very well as the chocolate treats were clearly the jewels of the dessert table. They were so decadent that one would be forgiving towards the slightly chewy over-chewy macarons. Sparkling like a bar of gold, the well-tempered Chocolate Yuzu Tart doesn't hit one in the face with a sharp citrus taste but it crawls in gradually towards the centre of the tart. There is a gorgeous dark chocolate ganache cake topped with raspberries but it could not surpass the supremacy of the Hazelnut Royaltine. This signature cake of Four Seasons lives up to its reputation with a satisfyingly thick and crunchy feuilettine. Probably a seasonal Italian inspiration, the ""chocolate salami"" is another dessert snack with its rewarding crumbliness and incorporation of salt that cuts through the cookie beautifully. Even ""mainstream"" desserts such as mixed berry crumble with buttery rocky-road chunks or the cloud-like bitter Chocolate pot de Crème stood notches above the rest. At a very reasonal price of $58, the Mezze dinner here goes beyond the sophisticated meal experience by creating a very welcoming, intimate ambience as if one is dining at home without feeling rushed or disturbed by loud, noisy conversations. Located just right next to the kitchen is the Chef Table which can seat up to 14 guests, making it a highly suitable option to host gatherings with your family and friends. But ultimately, it's all about the food. Driven by the philosophy of freshness and seasonality, there is of course one big catch: the menu changes all the time, so the yummy lobsters or chocolate yuzu tart might not appear on the buffet table on your visit. No worries, everything here is first rate."

We also ordered Tajima wagyu steak which was from their 'wood-burning grill'. It was fantastic, because I love the taste of steaks when they are slightly burnt from the grilling.

I think the same logic/concept applies to Artemis which offers complimentary bread, ranging from sourdough to some exotic Spanish bread, all served warm from the the bread basket. What made it hard to stop nibbling is the Dukkah spice and olive oil dip. I could detect some dominating aroma of Cumin, even though dukkah is a Arabic dry-roasted mixture of assorted spice, herbs and nuts. In fact, the use of spice and herbs is commonly seen across the dishes on its Mediterranean-centric menu which is simultaneously influenced by the flavors of coastal Spain, Southern France, Italy and Greece. Unlike most grill restaurants that focus on meats, Artemis Grill also offers large range of vegetarian and gluten-free dishes. One example is the Beetroot Tortellini ($20/30), a gorgeous plate of ring-shaped pasta filled with ricotta and feta. The intensely tangy flavors were neutralized by the sweetness of carrot purée mixed with apple juice and cinnamon. With a commitment to quality and sustainability, Artemis Grill works with artisan suppliers to bring the finest seasonal organic produce, free-range and hormone-free meat to the table. Even the seafood are sustainably sourced. The Alaska King Crab salad ($28) is a summery combination of chunky shellfish, avocados that is graced with the brightly sweet grilled pimento peppers. Yes, I could not believe that red peppers can be SO sweet.Served on a generous bed of greens and sweet corns, the Maine Lobster Tail($90) was redolent with the tantalizing char-grill aroma despite the absence of butter in the dish. It's springy and tasty with the drizzles of savoury corn jus, but a pity that the sweetness was partially masked by the bitter  charred marks. My favourite dish that evening, Spicy Iberico Pork Presa ($40) tasted like anything but pork. While it might bear resemblance to slices of roasted beef, the texture is slightly firm or even tad fibrous. Yet this shoulder cut is extremely flavorful, especially near the brown rims of the meat. The sweet plump tomato relish and padrano peppers complemented the subtle heat from the hearty dose of harissa chilli, making this Vegetable lovers will be delighted to know that there are plenty of interesting dishes to choose from on the ""Sides"". This is quite unlike most grill restaurants where sides are limited and predictable. The Crispy Heirloom of Cauliflower ($14) is a treasure trove of yellow and purple cauliflowers, some which are done in tempura style and drizzled with spicy aloli. I was missing the lemon zest here but this is salty enough to make you feel peckish. Besides the cheese and sweet wine, there are only about 5 desserts to choose from. Hence, I played the game of elimination and picked the Chocolate Trio, which is a fine play of chocolates in different textures, paired with a robust mocha gelato.  After having such a decadent chocolate dessert, I was awakened from the sweet slumbers by the extremely tart Apricot and Lavender Souffle ($20). The levels of sourish notes punched above the rest and even the nutty Walnut Creme Anglaise could not tame its wildness. That's when the sweet vanilla ice cream came as a timely company to the moist, creamy tower that exuded a character of its own. In fact, it is not just the cuisine that speaks for the place. Perched on the 40th floor of Capitagreen, Artemis offers the best vantage point for a breathtaking view of the Singapore skyline by day or by night. Together with the delicious cuisine that are carefully thought out on flavors and presentation, this place is one of the best dining spots I've ever visited in my life and I will definitely be back here for special occasions."

As well, we were invited back a second time, and we accepted, and I'm pleased to update this review as the second time around we had a great time. Service, drinks, food, and views were excellent, thank you!For this review - (2 stars for the first experience, 4 stars for the second, averaging out to 3) [ORIGINAL POST]: Bar views are amazing and drinks are too. However, the experience was soured because the bar staff that forgot our second round of drinks order and then became defensive and aggressive when we reminded them. Specifically, we placed a second round of drinks order and waited around 20 mins for it, when nothing appeared, we asked for the waiter who promised it in ""180 seconds"" (a weird promise but sure). Waited another 5-10 mins but nothing appeared, so we hailed the waiter who averted his eyes and ran to the bar (cue shaker sounds). When we asked for the manager and explained the situation and our frustrations she told us we ""needed to be patient"" and that the bar staff had been making drinks back to back all night. The bar was empty and there were 2 people at the counter. If you had forgotten our order (you clearly did) and straightaway apologized, we would have forgotten about it, but for your restaurant/bar manager to escalate the situation by saying ""please be patient, we are very busy and the bar staff has been making drinks back to back"" when we have been waiting close to 30 mins? That's frustrating and aggravating. When I said to the manager that I was simply lodging a complaint and she was being defensive, she got more annoyed and accused us of being impatient, effectively ruining our originally great night at this bar. All in all, great food, great drinks, terrible staff, rude manager, who needs more training."

We had dinner in the private dining room, which can accommodate up to 16 guests. The food is not Michelin Bib Gourmand standard , but is surprisingly not bad given the 'mass production' nature of the meal. The sole waiter was a bit rushed, but his zeal and friendliness resulted in commendable service. Good for business lunches or after-work group events, but you can do better when food quality and intimate ambience are critical factors."

He almost broke the door. When I came out and asked the reason the guys yelled at me saying there was a long queue  - it was literally five minutes we went in.I could hear the conversation from outside the door there was an Indian woman who skipped the Queue and lied that she was waiting there for half an hour(  sure this would have been captured on cctv if the bar cares to check) and this woman ran off as soon as I asked how long was She waiting for. However in any case it was not okay for this man to come and bang our door aggressively and to that when I decently told him that was not okay to do that  and he should at the very very least apologise this man told us that he didn't care and he could take the Liberty do whatever as he worked there. If the owner or the manger reads this- please consider this a feedback and no one wants to be treated like this. There are educated people who come to this bar and pay for services, keep your staff in check unless you want to run some cheap establishment.He was clearly high either drunk or something else and extremely aggressive.When I pulled my phone to take the video of his behaviour to us  this guy even got more aggressive.At least one of bar staff came up to us to ask and help try and resolve the situation and made an effort to understand ( this guy was actually the person that the woman was complaining to, as I recognise his voice and he had told the woman that someone was inside, she had to simply wait - professional), but this man came out of context and conversation and started harassing us. We clearly left this place feeling disturbed by this whole incident, what next he would have broken into the toilets if he wanted  ""because he worked there"".It's not okay to behave this way in a public establishment to paying customers, this is not a bouncer run club where we are drunk or doing something wrong. We paid, we did nothing wrong and left just on time we were suppose to leave and we were just two women that this guy tried to bully in a public place because he thought he could and he was the service staff.If you are unable to be sober you should not be working at a public establishment anyways.My friend actually pointed out that once she was here previously this same guy looked drunk and had misbehaved with her and another girl at the entrance.I have been to this bar in the past both in Singapore and New York and on the past they were so good but definitely this was a first experience in my life at any bar that left a sour taste and definitely my last at employees only.Please take some action against this sort of behaviour, instead of condemning your customers with comments like below.I would share this with anyone who want to go there, go to bars next door there is flamingo, cudroy etc that don't harass women and customers  or encourage this sort of behaviour."

While there are certainly a ton of other bars with perhaps more innovative programs and ambiance, I think EO is worth squeezing into your itinerary. They were packed the night I showed up, yet somehow found a way to squeeze me in at the bar. They were pumping out drinks quite quickly considering they were slammed. I noticed how much fun the bartenders were having while still maintaining professionalism. That is a delicate balance not always achieved. The bartenders were also excited to recommend other bars to visit while I was in town."

When I wasn't very inspired by the menu and ordered some classic cocktails, they also added their own twist to them and they were absolutely delicious. I've tried:- Fraise Sauvage: perfect for someone who loves refreshing drinks - extremely delicious- Provencal: super interesting with savory notes from the herbes de provence, loved it!- Ready Fire Aim: did not expect to love this because of the mezcal, but they balanced out the smokiness really well- Red Dawn: delicious and didn't have the earthiness from the beetroot at all- Mata Hari: so. yummy. The pomegranate juice really adds a delicious touch- Ginger Smash: refreshing- Negroni (single glass, not on the menu): super well balanced, very good version of this classic drink- Aviation (not on the menu): absolutely delicious! They added their own twist to it and I loved it- Corpse Reviver (not on the menu): delicious but I preferred other versions I've had- Daily Daisy: this was a frozen Sangria when I visited recently, it's deliciously spiced and not too strongThe food here is also pretty good for a bar - not exactly the only reason I'd visit but they were delicious. The skate wing is a specialty here and tastes great with the paprika sauce and spaetzle.The service is great if you're at the bar and only have to deal with the bartender. If you're seated at a table, the service can be slow because the servers are super busy.If you make a reservation, you'll have to sit at a table away from the bar since the bar is walk-in only. Also, if it were up to me, I'd only visit in the early evening. It gets crowded, rowdy and the music is way too loud past 9pm. For a bar where I'd like to have a nice conversation with people, it's extremely unfriendly when it gets that late.I'm taking one star off for the price (so. expensive.) and the noise level past 9pm. Otherwise, this place has 5-star worthy drinks!!! Would love to visit the NY store to try their drinks."

Everything I fancy in a nice restaurant - modern decor, yet having abit of old chic feel with its booths and lights.  Almost thought I was in a scene from Mad Men and I can just bump into Don Draper having an old fashion neat in the corner. Service was impeccable and our waitress was knowledgeable and offered valuable opinions. We ordered their fresh oysters for the day, and the 400g naked prime rib (medium rare) with half lobsters tail, hash brown for sides and 2 glasses of wine. Was about to order a dessert when the restaurant surprised us with a really sinful and delectable double chocolate birthday cake (it was my birthday). I could probably give it a miss for the oysters but my oh my ... The prime rib and the sweet garlic that serve ... Just typing about it right now makes me wish I'm there for dinner again. The steak was so good on its own , you wouldn't even need the mustard. Perfectly caramelised on the surface and tender and moist inside. The lobster tail was sweet, light and having a tinge of lemony taste. Gosh, and don't get me started on their hash brown. So sinful but decadent with that herb cheese stuffed with it. If it wasn't so expensive though, you would find me here maybe weekly. Well done Lukes !"

Attentive service as well that goes with the overall theme. We tried a lot of the starters and snacks: tuna tartare, deviled eggs, half dozen oysters, clam chowder and the lobster sliders. Everything was delicious and very filling so much so that we skipped to desert.

Boy, I've been on Yelp for a while now!I was taken here for a dinner on a Saturday night and being there reminded me of being in a chop house in the States. The waitstaff here are dressed as they would be in the US, and the place itself is clean-looking, small, and bright. It gets quite busy and crowded here on a Saturday night so be sure to make a booking. There weren't many empty tables in sight. They proclaim on their menu that all their seafood is procured from sustainable sources, so if that is a concern to you, eat re-assuredly here!We started with a tuna tartare (4/5), and portions run big here, so I am glad my companion suggested we share the prime rib-eye with garlic. The garlic is actually a whole head of garlic oven-roasted. This would probably be the only grouse I have with this meal, with that being that the garlic could have been cut in half and roasted with oil to a darkened goodness to elevate it further.I think the real star of the meal were the sides. I cannot forget the hash brown! The hash brown is a giant plate-sized of very crispy and finely-julienned potato, with some herb cheese stuffed within. This is a winner! I think they should have a breakfast menu and sell this as a rosti. The other sides were equally good, with the bacon, which is actually a slab of pork with maple and a slightly heavy-handed touch of liquid smoke, and crunchy green apple salad on top. Somehow in my head, after my first bite I assigned this dish to an Angmoh ""char siew"" of sorts, so I got a bit confused every time my companion asked if I wanted some bacon. We also got the creamed spinach (3.5/5)In true 'Murican fashion, we washed it all down with cocktails. I was glad that their Moscow Mules are served in copper mugs here, because it doesn't seem all that common in Singapore for some reason. Dessert! Banana and coconut pie with avocado ice cream, and some really nice crumble on top. Just the right amount of sweet, not overbearing, and very nicely warmed. Oh I do like this place! I would I like this place because of how it makes me feel, also perhaps maybe I do miss America. P.S. I love the musik here. And the service."

None of those crap fake crab cakes)- kurobuta pork chop (yummy and succulent)- prime ribeye (my least favorite but still a good piece of meat and a very large slice!)Special mention: OLD STYLE HASHBROWN. Whatever you do, order it. This is like nothing that you've ever tried. A perfect side dish, more like a rosti than a hashbrown. Crispy on the outside, and they filled it with Boursin cheese and spring onion. Pure genius and perfectly done.All the portions are really large. And when they heard that we are sharing, they actually served the dishes with 4 proper portions. No judgement for sharing dishes here. So we were all perfectly stuffed even though we did not order one main course each.Service was also great by Singapore standard. Our server heard that we are celebrating a birthday and they served up an awesome dessert that is full of candied ginger flavor. So so good. While it is not a cheap meal, we felt that it was well worth the money. Looking forward to returning for brunch as they serve up a brunch menu that has lobster roll....and yes, please also throw in the hashbrown."

(My view was facing a plain white tile wall and a fire hose reel. With all of the commotion behind me, I felt like my chair was in the way) The prices say fine dining, but the overall ambiance does not.  Because of this, I would say that the food (and dining experience) is waaay overpriced. Our table for 2 was almost too small for everything to fit.  It was like an ice cream shop table and chairs.  On the other hand, the mammoth bar runs almost the length of dining room and takes up too much of the small shop house space.  The bar could be downsized by half.   What they really need is a larger space.For dinner, I had the tuna tartar and the ""Luau"" ribeye.  My companion had a selection of a half dozen oysters and the prime rib au poivre (+foie gras).  The shared sides were the hashbrowns (with boursin cheese) and creamed spinach.  The tuna, the ribeye and the hashbrowns were amazing.  The prime rib had a (very peppery) peppercorn crust/sauce.  The foie gras was nothing special.  The tuna chunks were served on a layer of avocado chunks (tossed in a vinaigrette) and accompanied by grilled buttered bread.  Really memorable.  It could have been a meal by itself.  The luau flavours on the huge ribeye were a caramelized pineapple glaze(?) and I wish the flavours had been less burnt tasting. The tender meat was cooked perfectly.  The crispy hashbrowns were delicious.  The oysters and spinach were just what they should have been, though we wouldn't order either on a second visit.With 1/2 dozen oysters, tuna tartar, ribeye, prime rib (+foie gras), 2 sides, 3 martinis, a glass of red wine and 2 coffees, the total was $478 for 2 of us.  As good as the food was, I still can't bridge the gap between the high prices and the crappy small table too close to the front door.  A little overpriced for my book, but we look forward to returning for another special occasion.  Maybe with a larger group, we'll be treated to a grown up table further from the front door."

We tried quite a bit during our first experience at this restaurant and I can honestly say it was all good! The Tuna tartare is an excellent starter, so flavorful and well presented. The ciabatta bread that it came with was lightly buttered and toasted just perfectly (not overly crispy). When we realized that the restaurant had some boston roots, we had to order the clam chowder to see how they stacked up; it was wicked good dude. I won't forget the taste, it had some strong black peppercorn, which was perfect with the creaminess of the soup. My wife had the Rib eye ""naked"" and I had the scallops. I specifically ordered the scallops knowing that I'd probably end up eating a lot of my wife's steak. The scallops were presented well, dressed with some large capers, and the sauce was very delicious as well (if I'm not mistaken it may have been butter based?). They offered a side of coleslaw, which I didn't end of finishing, because if found the dressing to be a bit in the strong side. The steak was choice. Loved the seasoning they threw on it, really offered a ton of flavor to the outer side. They also offered 3 fancy mustards,  (though I feel that the steak itself required nothing additional), it was a nice complement. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and the kale salad as sides thinking that the portions would have been smaller. I won't write about those yet because we were so full that we ended up doggie bagging them. Overall great place, great atmosphere, prices are most definitely appropriate for the quality of the food. Enjoyed it very much and look forward to going again!"

There is hardly enough room for that.). Nonetheless a cool east-coast joint filled with swanky jazz music. The food is overpriced for the portion sizes and location of the restaurant.The food 1. Lobster sliders - Ok. Loved the mini toasted buns (tasted like fried mini man tous @Jumbo) but they were way to small even for me (a 5'2, 110lbs, petite, Asian lady). The lobster bits were ok. 2. Jumbo shrimp cocktail -  BAD. The waitress marveled at their house made sauce which was pretty awful. I can't quite put a finger to it. It felt like someone went crazy in the kitchen and mixed all types of flavors together - sweet, salty, sour etc... Sometimes less is more. 3. Clam chowder - Love! Thick & rich with generous sized clams in them. 4. Jumbo lump crab cakes - Love! Filled with real crab meat not those cheap mixed stuff some restaurants give you. 5. Tenderloin pepper crust $69, grilled foie gas +25 lobster tail +25  - Sadly, Overcooked. The meat was tough and dry. However, the sauce was good. The foie gas - I passed on. The lobster tail was sweet and good but for $25, the size was measly. I could finish it in 2 bites.  6. Oysters & clams - Ok. 7. Cornbread - LOVE!!! My favorite dish actually. Simple yet amazing. This was served as an starter instead of the staple, bread. It was a small, bite size muffin shape :) Service - Ok Ambiance - Interior deco Good. Simple yet classic. Mostly expat crowd."

The food here is incredibly good. I can safely say that I've had everything on the menu by now. It's true, the food is not cheap, but it's worth it.What I love about Luke's is that it's a 5 star restaurant that's totally unpretentious. Small enough to be cozy, extremely attentive service, perfect place to impress a first date or client. Now, the food. The clam chowder and prawn cocktail are my favourite appetizers. The lobster roll is excellent too (I think that's only lunch), and the prime steak is melt in your mouth. They used to have this avocado banana coconut tart that was magical, but have sadly replaced it since. Maybe if enough people ask about it, they'll bring it back! Until then, definitely have the choc chip cookies with the stout milkshake for dessert."

Marinated lobster meat in a buttery roll, it feels sinfully indulgent and is absolutely yummy. The burger, with bacon of course, is also very good.During dinner, I'd recommend the Lobster Pot Pie to anyone who likes lobster, or pot pies. BUT. At $99++ a pop (or pot for that matter), it's painfully expensive.And that's really my biggest dissatisfaction with Luke's. The place is prohibitively expensive! Sure the list of must-orders goes on with the clam chowder, the oysters, the clams, the shrimp cocktail, the cold lobster, the lobster sliders, the veal, the pork chops (I find that their steaks, whether at lunch or dinner, are spectacularly mediocre and not worth the money), but the prices!As someone who thinks that $450 a head at Shinji is worth it if you go every 6-9 months, and that $300 for dinner at Andre is, by comparison, a steal, it should say a lot that I think Luke's is prohibitively expensive. It's not an 8 course set menu, or a sushi omakase experience. It's an a la carte experience that can come out to more than $100 a head, depending on what you order, and while the portions aren't stingy, they aren't overwhelming.I'm regularly bewildered then, that Luke's is always so full that can't take reservations even when I'm calling a week in advance. Maybe they don't like me. Maybe they really are that busy. I don't know. All I do know is that damn some people earn a lot of money, and that the food at Luke's is undeniably delicious.And also (to me, at least) excruciatingly expensive."

To be fair, I had a cheeseburger at a place that bills itself as an ""oyster bar and chop house,"" so I was probably not hitting their signature dish. But I'd been dying for a good cheeseburger and I was cautiously optimistic that this might finally be the place in Singapore that could deliver. With all the add ons (house-cured bacon, egg, and cheese) the price crept up to $42++, so I was hoping to be blown away. It was pretty good. My wife has more refined tastes, so I got to try the lobster pot pie and the lobster corn soup, with kale salad and creamed potatoes on the side. These dishes were all more well-suited for their wheelhouse. They were generous with the lobster, so they earned the price point. ($115 for the pie.) I'd say the winning dish was the kale. Fresh, crispy, well-tossed, and nicely seasoned. And they had some conservative but respectable draft beer (Hitachino lager)."

Criteria: 1. It has to be opened (it's in the cbd & it's the weekend after all)2. Somewhere we haven't tried before3. Mid range price (approx $20/pax)Miss G's fulfilled all the above thus in we go! We ordered an Iberico Char siew rice with onsen egg and chilled Kang kong (pls note it's usually served in white rice but was changed to brown rice cos white rice is out), a chilled truffle somen with hotate and a lemon ginger whiskey highball.The portion of each main is ok but for a gentlemen with large appetite, it might not be sufficient. (Perhaps to entice one to order their yakitori or appetizers to go with?) The portion of the somen for a small eater like me was perfect.Overall taste of the food is good! The chili for the iberico char siew rice deserves a mention as it truly complements the dish by adding the extra punch and increases the appetizing quotient to the dish. The char siu can be more flavorful but it's still tender and definitely not dry. The kang kong is a tad too crunchy but still decent.The truffle somen is quite the real deal. Unlike many places where the truffle is just for a welcoming sniff and then disappears when you eat, the truffle is consistent throughout the somen, thoroughly soaked and ""well-oiled"". The hotate is also quite fresh but slices are rather thin.The whiskey highball does have the whiskey punch so don't play play. Overall a great discovery for us. :)"

First, if you venture into the restaurant itself (yes beer-ed up CBD folks, the bar has a restaurant), you'll find a souq filled with day beds, tables and a mosaic-tiled bar. There's loud Middle Eastern music to fill the air and I heard there used to be belly dancers. Food wise, I had hummus, tabbouleh, kebabs, chicken wings, lamb chops, the excellent shish taouk and some ground lamb thing stuffed in some flat bread or tortillas to look like quesadillas.

At the corner is May Hua Food Court which is 24 apparently opened 24 hours. I never dropped by so late or in the wee hours to find out. During the peak lunch period, it is crowded as is anywhere else in the CBD area. In the evening, it starts to get packed after 6+pm. Besides catering to the office workers, you also see laborers tucking into bowls piled high with rice (probably extra portion).There are a few stalls which seemed really popular - Roast meat stall in a corner facing Republic Plaza, pork soup (all kinds of pork parts - intestine, liver, meat ball, meat), ban mian, yong tau foo and Ah Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee (main branch in Hong Lim Park).The curry chicken bee hoon mee tastes the same as the one in Hong Lim Park, with the same smokey chili sauce which is really the highlight for me. The wanton noodles is really nice with a generous serving of char siew which is caramelized at the edges. It is flavorful and not dry at all. The wanton can be better as the skin feels too thick and sticky and the filling is quite normal. The soup is definitely the wanton soup which is peppery and tasty. I see many people order the roast duck noodles too. The roast chicken is not as good and the roast pork is decent. I think the noodles is better than the rice. Another favorite is the ""xiao guo mian"" - mini pot noodles, which is at another corner of the food court, facing the main road. It sells prawn noodles soup (not fantastic, can skip this) and bak chor mee (minced pork noodles). I like the mini pot noodles which is actually a pretty big portion with prawns, minced meat, sliced meat, fish ball, meat ball, fish cake (so good it sells it on its own). I find that the uncle cooking it is better than the auntie.For something light, the fish soup is pretty good. The yong tau foo stall has a large variety of choices. The ""cai fan"" (economy rice) stall has the usual stuff which is ok but not something I particularly like unless I want rice with more veggies. The beef stew from either the Thai or is it the Vietnamese stall at the back is terrible. I think the better food is found in the main area of the food court. It is a good place for local food if you are in the area at night and you want something fast and simple. Many places (especially hawker food) in the CBD area still mainly cater to the lunch crowd."

Being 2 pm, the office crowd has left and there were only a few stragglers left. I was told the bestsellers were the dry mee siam with assam chicken, assam laksa and ayam buah keluak set. I decided to get the dry mee siam with assam chicken though my inclination was for the ayam pongteh set. I guessed I liked to go with the recommended dishes when dining at a new place, especially when I was not sure what to order. I did not expect much as most dry mee siam I had was pretty lackluster. So I was surprised with their version. The dry mee siam packed a punch. The spices were subtly infused with the rice vermicelli and the sauce/gravy drizzled over it was full of the mee siam flavor - tangy from tamarind, lime and tau cheo (fermented beans). The only thing missing was the dried tau pok (dried bean curd) or tofu cubes. There was a small piece of shrimp and some slivers of fish cake, otherwise it was a plain dish. The assam chicken was equally good. There was a hint of smokiness in the chicken (still did not know why it would be smokey but it was all good) which was very tender and fell away from the bone easily with the fork. The gravy was not that assam-y (sour), instead it had lemongrass note to it. I think it would go better with rice than with the noodles. I would want to go back to try the other dishes. I find it rare to find places where you could actually taste the individual spices which made the dishes more aromatic and tasty. The last time I experienced that was actually in a nonya cafe in KL, Malaysia. The name of the cafe is a bit of a misnomer as the dishes are not solely peranakan. Some dishes are Penang style and the name Jonker is commonly known for Jonker Street in Malacca. Googling more, I found out the the owner's grandmothers hailed from Malacca and Penang, hence the type of food served."

I did not get a chance to eat anything beforehand, and we toured Gardens by the Bay all morning into early afternoon. We arrived for the afternoon tea session, which is 3:00-5:00 PM on Saturdays. I had made a reservation about a month ago for this.The cost is 60 SGD per adult. Tea selections can be changed as pots are finished. I stuck with sencha the entire time, and my mom enjoyed the jasmine. Eric R. started with Alexandria and switched to sencha. What was highly unusual about this afternoon tea experience compared to any other I have had in London, Osaka, or the U.S. is that besides our three-tiered server with sweets and scones, there was a buffet! The buffet included many savory dishes, plus four additional stations on the sides.The server kindly gave us a tour of the entire buffet and pointed out which items had pork so my mom and I could avoid them. The center of the buffet had salads, gravlax, smoked salmon, and toppings like capers. The hot entrees included fried buns with ""chili crab sauce,"" ""black carrot cake"" which is a stir-fried radish and egg dish, fried rice with vegetables, clam vermicelli noodles, Thai fried chicken wings, spring rolls, ""cronuts"" with masala potato, turkey rendang puffs, and Canadian salmon tarts. Another side of the buffet had soy milk and a local rose-like beverage.The stations included:1) curry chicken with paratha (roti)2) popiah (fresh vegetable wrap), kueh pie tee (fried cup with seafood stuffing), and rojak (fruit and tofu salad that one mixes together in a bowl)3) turkey roulade, stuffing, and pumpkin veloute with chestnuts4) dessert station with tiramasu, lychee yule log/roll cake, pannettone, pecan tarts, bread puddingOur three-tiered server included plain and blueberry scones with butter, clotted cream, kaya (coconut jam), and mango passion fruit jam. The middle tier had macarons, fruitcake, brown sugar coconut cakes (ondeh ondeh lamington), cassis chestnut tarts, stolen cookies, and cinnamon star cookies.We were stuffed but I joked this was my intermittent fasting triumph because I ate all of my food for the day between 3:00 and 4:30 PM! ""Last call"" for tea was supposed to be at 4:30 according to the menu, but we were asked at 4:50 PM if we wanted anything else, which was nice. We lounged leisurely until 5:00 PM before heading back to our hotel. Because of the wide range of dishes that represented so many cuisines, I would suggest this is a great place to ""taste the world"" in an afternoon tea, which is atypical (especially the buffet experience)."

The service was lacking, as it was unattentive and they were often slow to refill tea or other items. We noticed one of the food runners consistently dropped items at incorrect tables and didn't know the seat numbers, so he had to keep asking the customers what they ordered. We noticed him walking around aimlessly and would never clear an empty teapot after dropping off a fresh pot, leaving the table very cluttered. One of the teas my husband ordered came only somewhat hot and overbrewed, as if it sat waiting for a while. The savory set was tasty but was overall pretty heavy, all pastry-based and with a spiced or curried filling. I really enjoyed the masala cruffin. Their hot sauce was definitely one of our favorite things on the table. The holiday dessert set was very heavy as well, and most were too sweet. Their Ondeh ondeh lamington was the best thing from the dessert selection, after you remove the unnecessary ball of cream from the top.Also, anything left on the table you cannot take home, unlike other afternoon tea services I've found in London and the States. Ultimately, at $55SG/person, it's a pretty steep price for just a lackluster experience.It's a good place for those with deep pockets satisfied by a bougie room with no regard for food or service."

Oh yes!I know...... dinner at Clifford Pier and you had Bak Chor Mee?!?!?!But I couldn't help it. I absolutely love Bak Chor Mee and the fact they declared it ""Best"" made me just want to try it more and I had absolutely no regrets.Best Bak Chor Mee ($27.00) The minute the bowl came, I knew there was something different. The Mee Pok (flat yellow noodles) looked a lot thinner. Took a bit and I was completely drawn in. The noodle was springy (QQ) and had a nice snap to it and the seasoning was mind blowing  good. The vinegar they used was so fragrant. It was slightly sweet, slightly salty and slightly pungent, without any of it over taking each other. With each bite, it felt like multiple flavours filled the inside of the mouth, building up the anticipation for the next bite. It was complex, more complex than any Bak Chor Mee I've had before yet it all very balanced. They were very generous with the ingredients as well, with a mixture of minced pork, lean pork, pork ball and pork liver. The addition of lard was always a welcome and the inclusion of small pieces of crispy flat fish just added to the umami and gave a different texture to each bite. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the wanton. Wanton felt doughy despite looking fat and stuffed with ingredients and there was this taste of almost raw dough that lingered in mouth after eating. Apart from that hiccup, everything else was amazing. Nasi Goreng ($27.00) Nasi Goreng unfortunately was a bit of a let down. Not that it was bad, it was just very normal and well...... ""hotel"" standard. The rice was fluffy with a bit of spice, but it wasn't very fragrant and was more Chinese fried rice than Nasi Goreng and the fried chicken looked and  tasted a lot like it came out of a CP bag. The achar (pickled vegetables) it came with was pretty good. Not too sour and not too sweet. The star of the show had to be the satays. In all honesty, it looked like nothing much but it was good! The chicken satays were tender and you could taste the fragrant lemongrass in the marinade. The peanut sauce it came with was good too. It's a lot smoother than what you get outside yet having this almost peanut butter flavour to it. In fact, it was so good, we ended up ordering a plate of satay ($21.00 for 8 pieces. We had a mix of chicken and beef). Dining at Clifford Pier was truest and experience. The food had some hits and misses but I was overall still really good. The only thing was..... while the singer was good..... she didn't quite fit the setting. Still. And overall wonderful experience"

The hotel has a giant dining area, as well as a lounging area right beside it. Both are equally large with very high ceilings and an exquisite atmosphere. From what I have heard, the full-on buffet is not a regular happening, but on this day, there was a celebration in town (we went at the end of May), which was the partial reason for the buffet. From antipasti, to seafood, to salads, skewers, traditional rice- and noodle dishes, glazed pork belly and more; they had EVERYTHING on the menu. We were very happy with our choices.The staff was equally helpful with allergy questions and very attentive, which is also a great bonus. Can only recommend."

The other one is called Clifford Restaurant so look out!This place is a beautiful dining hall overlooking the MBS side, with nice chandeliers, big big vases of white orchids, and soft background music playing by a live band (for dinner). It is a very, very pleasant experience to dine here. Service here is impeccable, and waitstaff are attentive and prompt.Let's come to the important bit. The food.Cuisine here is Singaporean hawker food, served with an upmarket touch. The prices here are a steep mark-up from the usual hawker fare, so be prepared to shell out some heavy dough. I came here with a companion and we started with two popiah rolls (thin crepes stuffed with turnip, prawns, egg) ($12). I had the laksa with lobster ($36), which I enjoyed, apart from it not having cockles... My grouse was that my laksa was not Instagram-worthy, with bits of chopped lobster scattered in the laksa. Come on guys, for 36 bucks++ the laksa better look good.My companion had fried snapper with brinjal/eggplant. He rated it 6/10. You have to order rice separately, which is $5 extra, but you have a choice between white and brown rice, which is freeflow. Pretty sweet. I like the brown rice option. Plus point for having healthier choices!We ended the meal with a key lime pie for him, and an ice kacang for me.The key lime pie was good, and had a good digestive crust. They were very accommodating when I mentioned I didn't want peanuts and red beans inside my ice kacang. The ice kacang differs from the hawker one - the ice is very finely blended/ground, so that it is soft and is melt-in-the-mouth, unlike the crunchy feel from the hawker ice kacang. Our bill for two came up to 200 because we had two beers and a glass of champagne (they sell Perrier Jouet by the glass ehre ($30)). If you don't drink, I think this meal is still affordable - comparable to a normal restaurant meal.Would I come back? Maybe. Definitely not getting alcohol next time!"

The concept is great in theory, but it fell short on the quality-to-value scale. Aussie Roll basically caters to the average, rushed office employee who needs a quick lunch that's fuss free, inexpensive and portable. For those who don't like raw food, would like more protein and dislike vegetables, the cooked meat rolls *look* delicious and helpings are generous compared to say SSB, your average supermarket sushi roll or the mass market restaurant chains. It's relatively cheap too. So basically these are tummy fillers for the rushed.What I didn't like about the food was  that there wasn't much effort put into the flavors and it felt like I was eating a soulless, mass produced roll. If you've had some of the fast fusion food coming out the food truck scene in the U.S (mind you, I dislike making cross country comparisons but this felt especially relevant) for example, a bulgogi sub or taco cone can still taste excellent if you had each of the ingredients on it's own. That wasn't the case here with the rolls as a whole or with the ingredients pieced apart, which is what I ended up doing when I realized it was going to be a chore to finish my lunch.I had the beef bulgogi, teriyaki chicken, spicy prawn and salmon avocado. First thing that hit me was the rice was pretty bland, coarse and slap dashed together. Even for a supermarket sushi type chain, this seemed like a big flaw to me because 50% of sushi is the rice and you're serving it to Asians. The meats weren't great either - the beef bulgogi was tough and crumbly, that and the teriyaki chicken was too salty. The seaweed, was you guessed it, soft and rather tasteless.To save the day though, the aunties manning the counter were really funny when I asked them for recommendations. I can't reproduce our politically incorrect conversation but they were hilarious. Bottom line, Aussie Roll probably works for some and will last awhile because it serves the perfect market in Raffles Place."

Bored of staring at sushi conveyor belts? Get a quick fix at Aussie Roll,  right in the heart of CBD. This review is going to be simple.  Aussie Roll has a great appeal. The queue is long during lunch peak hours but it moves really quickly.  The 3 or 4 service personnel there have a good system going. There's a huge variety of sushi to choose from. Its listed on a wall inside which you can stare at while waiting in line -  another great idea! A few of my select favourite include the king prawn variations and calamari sushi! All really tasty. Choosing a particular 'roll'  of sushi gets you 4 pieces each and my normal meal consists of 2 to 3 rolls on average. By all means have more if you can. Soy sauce and wasabi takeaway sachets are also available just right after you are done paying. Almost production line like,  but if it works it works! Did I mention how affordable it is? At $2.60 to $3.20 for each roll,  you would hardly ever spend more than $12 here. Which is great for that much sushi. They are not stingy either in terms of how packed each roll is. Apparently the rolls go at 2 for 1 after 6pm, so hey,  pop over for dinner too if you are in the area. A much recommended fuss free joint if you want some no frills sushi and if you aren't too particular about sushi in general. This gets my stamp of approval."

Perfect for those after workout quick fix.- The rolls can be cut into four slices or eaten like a handroll.- Unlimited supply of wasabi, soy sauce, and utensils. There's also a sink for you to wash your hands! Ginger and mayo do cost extra though.The Bad:- There's no alternative healthy options, ie brown rice.

Also love how they leave the packets of soy sauce and wasabi outside for you to help yourself, so you don't have to keep going back to the counter to ask for more, and also give you a packet of tissues with your purchase. Very classy. I always forget to bring a packet of tissues with me when I'm out for lunch so it comes in very handy indeed!Also, they have a buy 2 get 1 free promotion every day after 6.30 or 7pm (can't remember exactly) - but it's a great deal so if you are still around raffles place at that time, drop by to pick them up!"

Woohoo :) Each roll is around $2.60-$2.80, and they cut it into 4 for you if you say yes to cutting.I had:1. Spicy soy chicken - ratio of meat to flavour was not quite there - a bit lacking in flavour given how chunky the meat was! Eaten with the sushi rice, it became a bit bland overall. Good meat though.2. Korean BBQ beef - pretty good! The second piece started tasting a little salty though.. Which made me actually eat the rice to balance it out. Nice that there was a bit of lettuce and some cucumber to add crunch3. Korean spicy pork - I think this was my favourite! At first I liked the beef, then on my second piece (I ate 2 pcs of each roll) that started getting a bit too salty. So this one had the best balance of flavours. Wasn't that spicy to me, but I have pretty high tolerance for spice.They also have your more normal rolls like cream cheese salmon, salmon avocado, seaweed salad (for vegetarians), deep-fried sweet potato, lobster salad (pity there weren't any left!) and all types of breaded seafood (I was trying to steer clear of deep fried stuff)."

It is near another salad place ""the Salad Corner"" which has a queue as it has very good pricing there. I like Platypus for its simple way of ordering which is pretty straight forward. There are 3 types of lunch boxes here- Balanced: 1 protein + 1 veg + 1 carb + 1 topping + dressing- High protein: 2 protein + 1 veg + 1 topping + dressing- High carb: Errr I think that is max carb + veg + topping + dressingYou can also add extra protein or carb or anything to any of the box or create your own. Add soup (changes daily and can be sold out before 1pm if it is popular) and drink to complete your meal. There are at least 6 types of proteins (fish, pork, chicken cooked in different styles) to choose from and 3 types of carbs (potato, pasta or rice). Toppings are the different type of nuts (walnuts, almonds) or dried fruits (raisins, cranberries). You can also choose to have corn or beans in your salad. I find these do change frequently, so it depend on what is available that day. The food is fresh and I love the poached salmon which is done to perfection. It is not hard or dry at all. The cheesy chicken is also wonderful, especially if you like cheese. It is filling and the price is $7.50 to $8.50 for a box, making it quite economical compared to other salad places with similar quality. Actually I think this fills me up better than the other places which seemed to be all vegs and less protein and carb."

We had the Chinese New Year Menu and to my wonderful surprise, the food standard didn't drop; every dish was good! We had Teochew yusheng first, that was rather different. Like a salad really, with abalone and a sweet sour plum sauce. Very appetising. Second dish was fish maw soup with crab. Filled with maw and crab, barely any starchy soup, it was warming and comforting with some black vinegar and cilantro. Third dish was whole roasted suckling piglet. The skin was wonderfully crispy and there was very little fat. If I can best describe, you don't feel guilty to eat this at all. Fourth dish was steamed pomfret. The big fish was just so succulent and steamed just done. This is an achievement because steamed fish is hard to get it right, much less a big fish. The soup was flavourful with a sourish tang. Fifth dish was steamed prawn. This was the only let down. Prawns are super fresh but probably a few minutes overdone so the meat was a little tough. Sixth dish is my absolute favourite. Yellow chives stir fried with scallops. There's a wonderful smokey flavour that was the result of using copious amounts of fried ti po (I believe it's dried pollack fish fillet). I liked the vegetables more than the scallops. Last savoury dish is fried mee Sua. I hoped for their signature kway teow but luckily this didn't let us down as well. Good carbo filler.  Dessert was orh nee with a twist - a whole steamed mandarin orange that was mashed into the yam paste. They were a little stingy with the portion though. We could get at best a couple of tablespoons per person. But it was tasty good. Maybe it was a good thing not to have too much of this sinful thing."

It's perfectly situated across the bay from Marina Bay Sands, and right next to Merlion Park. The views were spectacular, and even got to see the Marina Bay Sands light show twice while dining, incredible. Food wise I ordered what I came for, Chili Crab along with some Palm Beach Noodles and a Mango Breeze Cocktail. When they bring out  plastic gloves, wet naps, and a bib - that should be a warning for the carnage to come.. this meal was the messiest experience of my life. It was a fight for each morsel of meat, but once I got my bites in I was not disappointed. The noodles were also delish but heed my warning - the portions are no joke. The small would feed 3 people.I ate alone, and was served a meal for 4, at a price for 4. Overall pretty good.

The crab was of the highest quality and cooked to perfection, not to mention the ginormous size of 'em. The chili ""sauce"" was super flavorful; I wish I could've boxed it up and tossed it with some pasta. The pepper crab also deserves its glory as well. The flavor was quite pronounced from the locally sourced pepper. The downside was the price, but when in Rome (Singapore), am I right?I would suggest only sitting outside, where there are beautiful views of the Lion fountain, the water, and Marina Bay Sands.

The waiter who seemed like the outdoor seating Manager - again very nice but took our order and rushed away quickly. We got our food and didn't like the fried squid at all (very chewy and too sweet). However, no one attended to us at all and so we never had the chance to tell anyone it wasn't satisfactory. We then waited and waited and finally flagged down someone to get water re fills. Our table was never cleared and no one came by to ask us how we were doing at all. By the end of the dinner, we were so fed up that we just flagged down someone for the check and left. I was disappointed that we paid a lot of money for what we thought was a Michelin star level restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant.

Meat was super flaky and the gravy just lacked the flavor profile i was looking for. It had a very subtle tomato flavor but lacked the sweetness and acidity that tomato sauce has. There also wasnt much spice to it like what? Also the crab meat was definitely not worth the price. The meat came out in flaky bits and lacked the characteristic sweetness that good crab has. They at least had the mantou but since the AC runs very high in the restaurant the food becomes cold very fast. What a shame. I have had better at mellbem and engseng. If you are looking for good chili crab i would either recommend you give this place a pass or you consider making sure the crab they choose is a little smaller. Restaurant also has an odd off seafood smell at least that is what i can tell.

There was first confusion with our drink order, which was not a big deal except that our drink server took the incorrect drink that I had already tasted and gave it to a guest two tables down.

The location is pretty sweet; it's near the Fullerton Bay Hotel and has a great view of Marina Bay Sands. If you go for dinner, I would definitely recommend sitting outside as MBS at night is such a beautiful backdrop. In terms of dress code, I'd say it's casual, but if you want to err on the side of caution, then a black smart casual outfit would do. (I mean, you'll be eating messy crab, after all!)Get your ""That's what she said"" line ready because let me tell you: the Sri Lankan crabs they serve are HUGE. We're talkin' 2 kg behemoths, with claws the size of a child's face. You'll definitely pay for it; the market rate was $80/kg the last time we went.Both the chili crab and pepper crab are delicious; I guess if I had to choose a favourite, I'd go with the pepper. But by all means, definitely try the chili so you can compare and write an educated Yelp review! For sides, I've had the kai lan and seafood fried rice; both good but not anything to Yelp about. I'd definitely save room for dessert though, as their fresh fruit platter is refreshing and the perfect palate cleanser. If you're dining with guests who don't live in Asia, it's even better; it's a great way to introduce delicious Asian fruits like jackfruit, durian, and mangosteen, produce that can be difficult to find outside Asia.After you're done, walk off some of that crab by strolling along Marina Bay and snapping some shots in front of the famous Merlion!"

Anyway - the food was alright and I am biased b/c I am vegetarian and although I appreciate the special veggie prix fix meal that they had available for 35$S - the food was super bleh. Now as for the seafood my friends devoured - they got the chili crab and the black pepper crab and a few other dishes and totally devoured everything. I am giving this place 4 stars not b/c of my experience but from watching how much the rest of my party enjoyed the place. Additionally - the location is just great - great view of the Singapore bay and a view of MBS

The service was very slow, often waiting 10m or more to get water refilled even though we were paying a fortune for bottled water. Food also took forever to arrive and not well paced (does anyone really want the vegetables before the main course arrives?) The food itself was okay, though personally I prefer more meaty flavorful San Francisco crabs or even the small Maryland crabs which at least are easy to hammer open. They do not provide the tools you need and are stingy with napkins and wipes. Overall the experience was well below what you would expect at a higher end place and of course there is no view from inside the restaurant (where there is minimal though insufficient A/C). If you want better crab (minus the view) I'd hit one of the outdoor food centre/hawker stalls. And beware the spicy chili oil will do a number on sensitive stomachs. I'll be generous with 2*"

I've eaten at Shin Kushiya twice for work lunches and I love ordering the Ladies Set and the skewer combo platters. The Ladies Set comes with sashimi, some meh cucumber sushi (which you can substitute with sashimi), unagi, chawanmushi, salad and other stuff. That sort of rings like a winner takes all bento to me because I don't eat simple carbohydrates like white rice (if the restaurant started offering brown rice that would be perfect). The skewers are available ala carte and in sets, some of which include mushrooms, pork belly, chicken balls etc. My host ordered a fatty chicken liver (the poor cousin of the duck I guess) and it was pretty tasty, although the portion was so big you'd feel sick if you ate the whole thing. I usually pair my meal with the Yuzu cooler diluted with water.Lastly, the restaurant is decked out to look rather modern Japanese with dark wood paneling and the obligatory pawing cat on the counter.

No, if you grew up in the Philippines...you'd probably be like me and love Jollibee or Tapa King a LOT more than McDs.I am one of those who grew up being a BIG fan of Tapa King as my favorite fast-food breakfast spot. While others were chugging burgers and hotdogs at Jollibee or McDs, I would be having a RICE dish for breakfast like a freaking TRADITIONAL CHAMP. The rice dish is considered one of the most popular Filipino breakfasts to date known as  the TAPSILOG, which usually consists of a ""tapa"" (sliced spiced-meat and the main varying component of the dish), garlic fried rice and a fried egg (usually sunny-side up). To give you a better idea of what tapsilog is, here is a picture of the ""Tapa King"" set: yelp.com/biz_photos/tapa…There are many variations in this dish and are a part of the ""SILOG"" family. At Tapa King, you will see the flavor profile variations for the Tapsilog (with the King set - original flavor, Queen set - sweet & spicy, Prince - sweet, Joe - herbs, and Flakes - another variation in the seasoning) as well as a lot of different meat options that I'm going to go gung-ho on, such as CORNsilog and SPAMsilog, which uses corned beef and spam as the choices of meat.Not to mention, if you are a heavy rice eater...the garlic rice here is AYCE! (I must mention though that they don't seem to add salt to the garlic fried rice so its flavor profile is more on the ""plain rice side with hints of browned garlic"")They also offer a few other dishes that are not -SILOGS such as sinigang, which is one of my all-time favorite Filipino soups for its sour flavor profile. I'm eventually going to try those as well and will add to this review.Yelp 100: 10/100"

Also, this restaurant has a good reputation that no MSG will be added to any of the food.Long waited the infamous Red Chili Crab was finally arrived. The crab was in decent size. The presentation was nice. I first worried about the red chili sauce would be too spicy. Actually it wasn't so bad. It's a mixture of sour and spicy and the level of spiciness was kind of in the middle. It was very good. This is a must eat dish in here.Mantau was a deep fried steam roll. It is slightly sweet. It has a wonderful texture of the crispiness on the outside shell and softness in the inside of the mantau.Dou miao is fresh.Other than the dishes. The waiters were patient to explain the dishes on the menu and to show me pictures of the dishes which I wasn't sure what they were. Highly recommend this place!"

Well, unless you're deathly allergic, then maybe not. But for everyone else, Chili Crab is a must. I was told a story that Singapore is green because it apparently looks like a crab and a brown crab is an unhealthy crab so they decided to plant many trees to make it a green crab. It's alive!I think I missed some of the parts to that story, but nevertheless, crab is a really important part of Singapore for all tourists. It's not too hard to find places that serve Chili Crab and they're usually swarming with tourists. Crab is also super expensive but I figured it was worth the splurge as long as I could get a review out of the trip.I decided to go to Mama Kong's because it was recommended to me by a Singaporean friend. I had tried to go last year and was turned away because I didn't have a reservation. I wasn't about to make the same mistake this time and booked a reservation for 5pm -- table for one!The restaurant is small with seating both indoors and outdoors, It's a clean, sit down restaurant with a cozy vibe. Very different from the Chili Crab places about a block away. Reservations were made online and they have a rewards program, but since I don't live here I didn't sign up. I had had Chili Crab before at a tourist trap and it was awesome so I was expecting good things.The Black Pepper crab is ""The Original"" crab that is most recommended here. I was told it was spicy so I decided to get the classic Red Chilli (spelling it how it's spelled on the menu) instead. It's advertised as your basic Chili Crab, but Mama Kong's style. Both crabs were priced at $50 ($36.67 USD), so it didn't make a difference in terms of budget. Again, crab is always expensive in Singapore. It's probably possible to find cheaper crab, though.I was parched and got an apple juice, as well. It was $6 ($4.40 USD) and it literally tasted like apple juice, so I wouldn't say this was special by any means. It was definitely over priced but whatever, I needed something to drink and Mama Kong's didn't have a special drink that I was dying to try.The apple juice came first, followed by the Chili Crab shortly after. The crab was huge and I also ordered Fried Mantou for $3 ($2.20 USD) which is commonly served with Chili Crab. The Fried Mantou were so good! They were a bit heavy for me so I didn't eat all of them, but while they may have been unhealthy, they were also very delicious. I dipped the bread into the Chili sauce and enjoyed.The crab came pre-cracked. They have a de-shelling service but I didn't need it. I made piles of crab meat on the small plate they provided. I then put the meat onto the big spoon and scooped some Chili Sauce. The crab meat was juicy and there was a decent amount. The Chili sauce was sweet with a strong kick. I don't like spice so it was borderline too much for me, but I was pretty happy overall. It didn't go too well with the apple juice, though. Next time, I'll opt for a water.The restaurant was pretty empty while I was there but it's probably because I got there so early. The waiters asked to take a photo of me and gave me a copy with my check. The service was good and every one was super nice.I think Mama Kong's is a great place to go if you're looking for Chili Crab and you want a nice, cozy ambience. However, the actual quality of the crab was similar to that of the crab I've had a tourist traps and the crab overall was a bit too pricey for what it was. Plus, the $6 apple juice really threw me off.TOTAL COST: $70.05 ($51.38 USD)34 Mosque StSingaporeThis review is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews."

We tried Hainanese Chicken Rice our first night and Fish Head Curry from Banana Leaf Apolo the following day. For our last full day in Singapore, we headed out to Chinatown to try Chili Crab at Momma Kong's.Our initial research pointed to No Signboard Seafood as the place to get chili crab. However, recent reviews of No Signboard Seafood point to a decline in dining experience so we decided to give Momma Kong's a try.Reservations are highly recommended as the place was quite popular and cozy, with indoor and limited outdoor seating. Even in late December, it was hot and humid in Singapore and indoor seating with AC is preferable. We made a reservation for 2 for 5:00 PM, right when they open. They must get busy since we were informed they have a 7:00 PM reservation for the same table and they hoped we would be done by then. I was a bit put off by that but I knew we would not be lingering that long so no harm no foul.I ordered the red chili crab (Sri Lankan mud crab fresh flown daily - at least that's their claim) with jasmine rice. My wife, a self-proclaimed ""lazy eater"" opted for the prawn fried rice. For starters we shared the fried tofu chips with a zesty tomato-based dipping sauce. To round out our order, we ordered fried mantou and a couple of refreshing calamansi juices (on the menu as lime juice).The chili crab was the unquestioned highlight of our dinner...and it got messy. The chili gravy wasn't spicy and even had a hint of sweetness. The crab was fresh and I had to work to extract the meat...for the both of us. They can de-shell the crab for a fee ($15?)...but where's the fun in that? Needless to say, I used multiple napkins (so rare to find napkins in restaurants in Singapore) during dinner. The prawn fried rice was good as well as were the fried mantous. The fried tofu chips were also a hit. Based on food alone, we were inclined to give this place 5 stars. However, I rate on the entire dining experience.So what were the negatives? For starters, we didn't ask for but we were served these coated peanuts. They were OK...nothing special. We thought they were complimentary only to find out we were charged $2 SGD (Singapore Dollars) for them. We also used the wet napkins on the table (of course...this was a crab place and it gets messy)...and was charged $0.60 SGD for them. Oh yeah, we also found out they added a 10% Service Charge for a dinner for 2! I just can't help but feel like we were being nickeled and dimed for what already was a relatively expensive meal...just took away from the experience.Dinner for 2 came out to just under $108 SGD...or about $75 (US) in ""real"" money."

Momma Kong's was just a few walks away from our hotel and it looked pretty decent joint, a small-ish one but with good reviews, so we went in. We didn't take the package (you should if you're a big eater, we found out later that the package for two people is really good deal), but we ordered one crab each, the black pepper and the chili one and a set of steamed mantou to wipe all those delicious crab broth away.The crabs were super delicious and we were super happy. I had problems with cracking the claws but the staff spotted it right away and helped with it. My boyfriend who never had such large crab experience before also dove right in without any problem. My chili crab was perfect with the perfect amount of burn and the black pepper was super delicious. The bill came at around 75 dollars or so, so it was almost the same price with the package ( I believe the package is without drinks, and alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore) and we had beers, so if you think you can eat a lot, go for the package.I would definitely go back to this place if I had time next time. I am still thinking about the chili crab these days....and do book a table online, they can be a bit busy!"

They have other flavors besides the famous red chili crab. They have side dishes as well, which seemed a bit over price to me. We tried the tofu fries - which came with a spicy chili dipping sauce, it was alright! I would definitely just focus on the crab. It depends on hungry you are, but it seems like one crab per person is the norm if that's going to be your main meal. Butter crab was a bit bland (so good for those who can't handle the heat), and pepper crab (the OG Momma Kong's crab) was too peppery (?). The red chili crab still my favorite, sweet, savory, and spicy. **TIP: try the steamed mantou buns. They're super soft and fluffy, and helps to soak up all the delicious crab roe and gravy."

My sis, mum and bro in law have been here a couple times and raved about the bee hoon crab and butter crab. According to them the chilli crab which was supposed to be their best seller was so so. They had a not so great experience with sotong last time so decided to give the stingray a try this time. The bee hoon crab was cooked with bee hoon soup. Soup broth was milky and sweet. Very delicious. Crab was very fresh. Peranakan crab was so so. Found the sauce to be aromatic but lacking in taste and a tad too oily. Crab tastes great. Fried mantou was very good but slighlty oily. Stingray was bad. Tasted like they steamed or boiled the stingray first and just grilled it a little in oven with leaf and chilli. The sambal was also very weak in taste. Worst sting ray i ever had. Stingray had a fishy smell. My bil who had blocked nose was only one who could eat it. Shanghai greens was meh. Totally meh. Just fried with garlic and not enough salt. Conclusion: they are only good with their crabs. And honestly quite upset with their service as they missed out part 2 of our order which is the peranakan crab and veg and barely an apology."

DING. Four of us. FOUR CRABS. Done.Chilli. Pepper. Fresh steamed. And Bee hoon soup. We had all four of their preparation styles. We also had their chili marinated top shell starter that was SUPER GENEROUS in terms of portion size, and a nice, spicy starter. Only I had to eat most of it because top shell wasn't too popular with the rest of the people at the table. A single portion shared amongst 6-8 people would be ideal though. It'd really whet your appetite.The crabs. Now the bee hoon soup was... average, the fresh steamed incredibly unmemorable, the chili a bit too sweet, but the pepper was quite delicious. Not quite Eng Seng at Joo Chiat level, but good. Why was it so disappointing though?a) Temperature: some of the crab pieces were actually a little cold. It seemed like all the crabs had been pre-cooked and then they're reheated and tossed in whichever sauce you order it in. b) Freshness: the crabs didn't come across as very fresh. The flesh had that slightly mushy, waterlogged texture that comes from freezing, and it was especially noticeable in the legs where the meat was really almost unpleasant. One of the crabs we had, I think the steamed one, also had a rather unpleasant smell of... ammonia. It tasted okay, still sweet, and a little mushy, but it smelled really unpleasant.Overall, the value was okay, but when I eat crabs, it's all about freshness. I'm sticking to Happy Crab at Pahang Street.yelp.com.sg/biz/happy-cr…At least there the crabs are super fresh."

The toast was perfectly crisp and conveniently bite sized. The Taro kaya sauce was delicious, not too sweet yet enough to give your toast the kick it needed. I also tried the Thai green milk tea which is priced at $2.80. Previous yelpers had noted how they witnessed the workers brewing the tea right in front of them, but my experience was a bit different. Perhaps they have tried to operationalize the practice to be more efficient, but all I saw was the workers pouring pre-made Thai milk tea into my cup and sealing it.

There was much more on the menu that I would have loved to try, such as the uni, as well as the pork jowl with curry.   We washed this down with a couple bottles of wine, fairly priced under $90, but still the tab came out to $150/person, and I was still hungry.  So overall, I would definitely come here again, but perhaps not as hungry, and I would love to try some of the cocktails as well."

Second, they play some fun catchy 80s tunes to get the party going (which brings me back to my old stomping grounds in Murray Hill, NYC)! Third, the drinks are relatively cheap, albeit watered down and/or measured, as is most alcoholic drinks in Singapore (ugh!). Fourth, the crowds are good looking expat working professionals (very few, if any, locals to be found).To conclude, I give this place 5-stars for the atmosphere, but more importantly it's the place where I've met so many of my Singaporean based friends, since moving to this country three yrs ago. I liked it so much that I had my 28th birthday party here!"

Kinki is pretty casual, which I really like and if you go early evening, you can catch a really good happy hour. (2 for 1) When they don't have a DJ, they have an awesome setlist of old school R&B jams- which I really enjoy as its very hard to get that anywhere else in Singapore and it goes nicely with the funky, urban style setting of the bar.Bar food is great also.

Ok let's skip the fanciful words and read this: fresh sashimi with flavourful truffle = a clear winner. The Pork Belly with Truffle was melt-in-your-mouth lovely and left a aromatic aftertaste swirling in your mouth with the shaved truffle. Plus, indulge in the Fresh Sashimi Platter (with Maguro, Amaebi, Hotate, Hirame, Hamachi and Sake) which features fresh cuts of plump meat, no scrimping there.A word of advice, be down there when you are feeling ready to spend and order without looking at the price list.

The salmon was of a generous serving, cooked perfectly moist and tender. The mochi dessert is always the highlight of my meal because it's delightfully chewy and fragrant - I wish they'd provide 2 pieces instead of 1 every time. I do find the price of $5 for tea a tad exorbitant but you're paying for a nice view with a relaxing ambience. It can get crowded at lunch if you're in a big group so make reservations on Chope."

However it's worth checking out if you go for their weekday lunch sets! I got the executive sashimi set for $46. The set came with miso soup, rice, pickles, a fresh salad and a mochi dessert. The strawberry cream mochi wasn't anything great, and the green tea mochi also had a cream and red bean paste within, but I thought the best one was the simple peanut mochi that had no filling.The rice was just normal white rice, so if you want Japanese rice, they charge you more for it. This seems rather outrageous, if you ask me. It's a legitimate japanese restaurant, so they should be serving proper japanese rice! The miso soup was average, salad was very fresh and crisp, but the cream mochi was too creamy so I didn't enjoy it. The sashimi was very fresh though! It was pretty good quality, and there was a wide variety. They have 2 pieces of each type, and one sweet prawn. They even give you 2 pieces of the fatty tuna and scallops, which are pretty premium.The service staff aren't friendly, but they are efficient at filling up your green tea cups and clearing your plates, but they're a miserable looking bunch with nary a smile for anyone.The other saving grace is the view you get overlooking the bay and their chic interior. I really love the strange but interesting light made of black cords and bare light bulbs arranged to look like a chandelier on a low ceiling. Save it for a special lunch date or business lunch meeting, I suppose, but I find that it isn't great value for money here."

Sorry to say this as Kinki has a cool vibe and a nice rooftop where i've taken guests in the past. I thought the staff was poorly trained and the dine-in policies bizarre and inflexible. Suffice to say, I wont be going back.I attended my friends birthday party at Kinki where she reserved a table for 20 from 6 - 9 PM. My partner and I arrived about 1 hour late and at that time the table (for 14) that was given to us was over-packed already. We noticed that the table for four next to our large party was available and I asked to sit there so we could be close to the birthday party. We were told by the wait-staff that the table was reserved. Ok no issues, we were only 2 people and didnt want to take up the larger table so we asked to sit at a 2 person table in the vicinity of the party. Again, that table was reserved. We then approached the manager and told them of our situation: we had a party for 20 but were seated in a 14 person table but we arrived late and the wait staff wont let us sit at the tables nearby. So how?The manager let us know at that point that the entire restaurant was booked for the night. Perplexed, I looked around the restaurant of (im estimating) 30 tables and only 8 of them were occupied. As we were with the large birthday party, i inquired if could eat quickly at any one of the reserved tables before the parties arrived and was told that we could not as the tables were reserved. I then asked what time the people were coming for their reservation for the tables near the birthday party and were told that she didnt know. Then I asked since they didnt know, if we could eat and if the party came, they could be seated at another one of the 15 open two seater tables. Again, I got the ""cannot sir"". I asked her ""so you are telling me that we are here for a birthday party already eating, you have 75% of your restaurant unoccupied and you are not letting us eat"". The only reply i got was sorry the restaurant is reserved. I thought this was odd, and we were left awkwardly hovering near the birthday party table for about 10 minutes while they hurriedly finished eating. At that point we were told by the birthday girl that we had a reservation upstairs at the bar and that they had some bar snacks that we could eat. We hovered and waited for critical mass to finish eating and headed up stairs to the open air bar area. Despite a reservation for 20, Kinki gave us a table to seat 4 but was in the corner so we had some standing room only spots. We ordered a few bottles with all the mixers and ice buckets so there was little room for us to order food to eat. I asked the bar wait-staff, if we could sit at the table next to ours so that we could order some bar food to eat. Again, that table was reserved. Looking around there was our party of 18-20, and about 8 other people in the rooftop bar area and about 15 open tables. I asked the wait staff what time the table was reserved for and he said 10pm. Looking down at my watch, it was only 8 so i asked him to give us the seat for 30 mins so we could quickly eat and then we would go back to the original table. He said, sorry the table was reserved and walked away. However, he then came back a few minutes later and nicely said okay we could site there for an hour. Another wait-staff took our order and being vegetarian I ordered the Vegetarian Okonomiyaki. He told me that the Okonomiyaki was not available. There weren't many vegetarian bar snack options so I asked if i could order from the restaurant menu. ""No, you cannot"". I asked where the bar snacks were being prepared and he answered ""the restaurant downstairs"". Odd... I told him nevermind and that I ordered a drink. When he came to bring my drink he apologized and told me that the Okonomiyaki was available so I confirmed the Okonomiyaki order.The vegetarian Okonomiyaki was brought out abut 30 mins later and it wasnt Okonomiyaki looking at all. It was mayonaise atop toasted bread but wasnt bad tasting until I bit into something that tasted like chicken. At this point i was about to lose my sh*t. I asked my meat eating friends if it tasted like chicken and 2 out of 3 agreed. I approached the wait staff and  told them annoyingly that they had served me meat on a vegetarian dish. The wait-staff shook his head violently and flapped his arms up and said looking even more annoyed than me, ""that was vegetarian"". They sent another wait-staff who confirmed that it was mozzarella cheese. I never really knew mozzarella cheese and chicken could be so easily confused and let my friends eat the rest of my dish. No dinner for me after 3 hours of trying, thanks Kinki!"

The food is a but pricey for the amount given but the quality is great. I LOVED the tai carpaccio and truffle rib eye. Also loved the spicy edamame. It had tons of flavor. I consider the sushi to be so so and not really worth the price.  There are plenty of better dishes and the okonomiyaki is not like the japanese varitey at all but is really just a pizza ( but its still good).  I wouldnt come for great japanese food but its dishes are inventive and pretty good with a few misses.The bar above is a really fun spot. I love the atmosphere, the view of the bay, the open air, etc. They also have these great miso pork nachos that are awesome.  Its fun and lively and a great spot to preparty or just hang out for the night.  Its just as good a view as the lantern but half the price.  Definitely on my go to spot for showing friends around singapore"

The price for food is in the upper range which is being compensated by the quality. The environment is nice so far or maybe I have just been lucky. I'm not into the pretentious places and so far Kinki this is not the case at all during my visits.The setup of this venue is ideal be it for a lunch or dinner, meeting or date.I'm not big on drinking a lot when eating sushi however they have a bar there which by itself is worth visiting as well.

It's a good spot for post-work and farewell drinks. The drinks are OK-ish price wise (a Gin & Tonic costs around $12+++ I think) . I suppose you can expect to pay a little more for the ambience, etc.As Kinki is an open roof top bar, it can get a little warm on some nights. They do have fans etc. to alleviate the warmness though. It's usually busy and crowded. They play good music which sometimes veers on excessively loud to me (maybe I'm getting old?), so expect to do more shouting than talking."

However it's worth checking out if you go for their weekday lunch sets! I got the executive sashimi set for $46. The set came with miso soup, rice, pickles, a fresh salad and a mochi dessert. The strawberry cream mochi wasn't anything great, and the green tea mochi also had a cream and red bean paste within, but I thought the best one was the simple peanut mochi that had no filling.The rice was just normal white rice, so if you want Japanese rice, they charge you more for it. This seems rather outrageous, if you ask me. It's a legitimate japanese restaurant, so they should be serving proper japanese rice! The miso soup was average, salad was very fresh and crisp, but the cream mochi was too creamy so I didn't enjoy it. The sashimi was very fresh though! It was pretty good quality, and there was a wide variety. They have 2 pieces of each type, and one sweet prawn. They even give you 2 pieces of the fatty tuna and scallops, which are pretty premium.The service staff aren't friendly, but they are efficient at filling up your green tea cups and clearing your plates, but they're a miserable looking bunch with nary a smile for anyone.The other saving grace is the view you get overlooking the bay and their chic interior. I really love the strange but interesting light made of black cords and bare light bulbs arranged to look like a chandelier on a low ceiling. Save it for a special lunch date or business lunch meeting, I suppose, but I find that it isn't great value for money here."

Ok let's skip the fanciful words and read this: fresh sashimi with flavourful truffle = a clear winner. The Pork Belly with Truffle was melt-in-your-mouth lovely and left a aromatic aftertaste swirling in your mouth with the shaved truffle. Plus, indulge in the Fresh Sashimi Platter (with Maguro, Amaebi, Hotate, Hirame, Hamachi and Sake) which features fresh cuts of plump meat, no scrimping there.A word of advice, be down there when you are feeling ready to spend and order without looking at the price list.

In my view, it's the best after-work / happy hour bar in Singapore. Friday nights are simply packed. First off, it's got an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands. Second, they play some fun catchy 80s tunes to get the party going (which brings me back to my old stomping grounds in Murray Hill, NYC)! Third, the drinks are relatively cheap, albeit watered down and/or measured, as is most alcoholic drinks in Singapore (ugh!). Fourth, the crowds are good looking expat working professionals (very few, if any, locals to be found).To conclude, I give this place 5-stars for the atmosphere, but more importantly it's the place where I've met so many of my Singaporean based friends, since moving to this country three yrs ago. I liked it so much that I had my 28th birthday party here!"

They have left out certain items in our order until we checked and the food was just ok.  I would say go for the location and the view but nothing more."

Kinki is pretty casual, which I really like and if you go early evening, you can catch a really good happy hour. (2 for 1) When they don't have a DJ, they have an awesome setlist of old school R&B jams- which I really enjoy as its very hard to get that anywhere else in Singapore and it goes nicely with the funky, urban style setting of the bar.Bar food is great also.

Ok let's skip the fanciful words and read this: fresh sashimi with flavourful truffle = a clear winner. The Pork Belly with Truffle was melt-in-your-mouth lovely and left a aromatic aftertaste swirling in your mouth with the shaved truffle. Plus, indulge in the Fresh Sashimi Platter (with Maguro, Amaebi, Hotate, Hirame, Hamachi and Sake) which features fresh cuts of plump meat, no scrimping there.A word of advice, be down there when you are feeling ready to spend and order without looking at the price list.

The mochi dessert is always the highlight of my meal because it's delightfully chewy and fragrant - I wish they'd provide 2 pieces instead of 1 every time. I do find the price of $5 for tea a tad exorbitant but you're paying for a nice view with a relaxing ambience. It can get crowded at lunch if you're in a big group so make reservations on Chope."

However it's worth checking out if you go for their weekday lunch sets! I got the executive sashimi set for $46. The set came with miso soup, rice, pickles, a fresh salad and a mochi dessert. The strawberry cream mochi wasn't anything great, and the green tea mochi also had a cream and red bean paste within, but I thought the best one was the simple peanut mochi that had no filling.The rice was just normal white rice, so if you want Japanese rice, they charge you more for it. This seems rather outrageous, if you ask me. It's a legitimate japanese restaurant, so they should be serving proper japanese rice! The miso soup was average, salad was very fresh and crisp, but the cream mochi was too creamy so I didn't enjoy it. The sashimi was very fresh though! It was pretty good quality, and there was a wide variety. They have 2 pieces of each type, and one sweet prawn. They even give you 2 pieces of the fatty tuna and scallops, which are pretty premium.The service staff aren't friendly, but they are efficient at filling up your green tea cups and clearing your plates, but they're a miserable looking bunch with nary a smile for anyone.The other saving grace is the view you get overlooking the bay and their chic interior. I really love the strange but interesting light made of black cords and bare light bulbs arranged to look like a chandelier on a low ceiling. Save it for a special lunch date or business lunch meeting, I suppose, but I find that it isn't great value for money here."

It was also very hard to track down anyone to ask questions about the menu or even take our order. When we finally got someone to help us, they told us the wrong info as we asked for example how many pieces of sushi comes with the Kinki Customs and he said two when infact it was 6 when it came out. My one friend waited for over an hour for her vegetarian pizza without any apology. She also asked for the meat one without a topping and they told her it was already made so it can't be changed. When the food came out, they just placed it in the middle of the table and left without saying what it was or even putting it in front of the person who ordered.

What better place to reintroduce my tongue to Japanese than the uber-swanky new Japanese restaurant Kinki.  The place is decorated with koi acrylic floor paintings, Oishinbo inspired food portraits on the walls, and very low furniture making it seems futuristic and modern. Also the view is breathtaking.I had the edamame (salted to perfection), vegetable tempura (best I've ever had), and pomegranate miso black cod while my companions stuck mostly to sushi.  The sashimi we saw coming out of the kitchen made me drool by the way.  All of the food was spectacular and obviously was washed down with sake.  I would just caution that the miso was just barely cooked which I'm sure is the method de jour but I am just barely adult enough to handle undercooked fish.  Stick with the raw stuff if this bothers you too.  The sushi I was able to sneak off my husband's plate was fun and inventive and really tasty.At present the clientele is mostly older business gentleman. I suggest we turn this around and make it a haunt for the younger foodie crowd.  You won't be disappointed."

Sorry to say this as Kinki has a cool vibe and a nice rooftop where i've taken guests in the past. I thought the staff was poorly trained and the dine-in policies bizarre and inflexible. Suffice to say, I wont be going back.I attended my friends birthday party at Kinki where she reserved a table for 20 from 6 - 9 PM. My partner and I arrived about 1 hour late and at that time the table (for 14) that was given to us was over-packed already. We noticed that the table for four next to our large party was available and I asked to sit there so we could be close to the birthday party. We were told by the wait-staff that the table was reserved. Ok no issues, we were only 2 people and didnt want to take up the larger table so we asked to sit at a 2 person table in the vicinity of the party. Again, that table was reserved. We then approached the manager and told them of our situation: we had a party for 20 but were seated in a 14 person table but we arrived late and the wait staff wont let us sit at the tables nearby. So how?The manager let us know at that point that the entire restaurant was booked for the night. Perplexed, I looked around the restaurant of (im estimating) 30 tables and only 8 of them were occupied. As we were with the large birthday party, i inquired if could eat quickly at any one of the reserved tables before the parties arrived and was told that we could not as the tables were reserved. I then asked what time the people were coming for their reservation for the tables near the birthday party and were told that she didnt know. Then I asked since they didnt know, if we could eat and if the party came, they could be seated at another one of the 15 open two seater tables. Again, I got the ""cannot sir"". I asked her ""so you are telling me that we are here for a birthday party already eating, you have 75% of your restaurant unoccupied and you are not letting us eat"". The only reply i got was sorry the restaurant is reserved. I thought this was odd, and we were left awkwardly hovering near the birthday party table for about 10 minutes while they hurriedly finished eating. At that point we were told by the birthday girl that we had a reservation upstairs at the bar and that they had some bar snacks that we could eat. We hovered and waited for critical mass to finish eating and headed up stairs to the open air bar area. Despite a reservation for 20, Kinki gave us a table to seat 4 but was in the corner so we had some standing room only spots. We ordered a few bottles with all the mixers and ice buckets so there was little room for us to order food to eat. I asked the bar wait-staff, if we could sit at the table next to ours so that we could order some bar food to eat. Again, that table was reserved. Looking around there was our party of 18-20, and about 8 other people in the rooftop bar area and about 15 open tables. I asked the wait staff what time the table was reserved for and he said 10pm. Looking down at my watch, it was only 8 so i asked him to give us the seat for 30 mins so we could quickly eat and then we would go back to the original table. He said, sorry the table was reserved and walked away. However, he then came back a few minutes later and nicely said okay we could site there for an hour. Another wait-staff took our order and being vegetarian I ordered the Vegetarian Okonomiyaki. He told me that the Okonomiyaki was not available. There weren't many vegetarian bar snack options so I asked if i could order from the restaurant menu. ""No, you cannot"". I asked where the bar snacks were being prepared and he answered ""the restaurant downstairs"". Odd... I told him nevermind and that I ordered a drink. When he came to bring my drink he apologized and told me that the Okonomiyaki was available so I confirmed the Okonomiyaki order.The vegetarian Okonomiyaki was brought out abut 30 mins later and it wasnt Okonomiyaki looking at all. It was mayonaise atop toasted bread but wasnt bad tasting until I bit into something that tasted like chicken. At this point i was about to lose my sh*t. I asked my meat eating friends if it tasted like chicken and 2 out of 3 agreed. I approached the wait staff and  told them annoyingly that they had served me meat on a vegetarian dish. The wait-staff shook his head violently and flapped his arms up and said looking even more annoyed than me, ""that was vegetarian"". They sent another wait-staff who confirmed that it was mozzarella cheese. I never really knew mozzarella cheese and chicken could be so easily confused and let my friends eat the rest of my dish. No dinner for me after 3 hours of trying, thanks Kinki!"

It's a good spot for post-work and farewell drinks. The drinks are OK-ish price wise (a Gin & Tonic costs around $12+++ I think) . I suppose you can expect to pay a little more for the ambience, etc.As Kinki is an open roof top bar, it can get a little warm on some nights. They do have fans etc. to alleviate the warmness though. It's usually busy and crowded. They play good music which sometimes veers on excessively loud to me (maybe I'm getting old?), so expect to do more shouting than talking."

Totally melts in my mouth. Also really like the wagyu aburi sushi, salmon belly aburi sushi, unagi and anago sushi as well as the botan ebi and uni aburi sushi ... all pretty tasty! We also really like the momotaro tomato with ginger dressing and snow crab, organic tofu and century egg with ponzu sauce and ginger. The grilled black cod marinated in Kinki pomegranate-honey miso served with braised gobo and scallions is supposed to be a Kinki specialty, but we thought it was just so-so. The wagyu ribeye cooked over cast iron seasoned with truffle sauce was pretty good as was the pan seared kurobuta pork belly served with Kinki's spicy sesame sauce. We were not impressed by the Kinki okonomiyaki, i.e. a Japanese styled pizza of Hokkaido scallops, prawns,apple wood smoked bacon, sweet onions and mozzarella. Kinki doesn't have a wide selection of desserts so we tried the most exotic sounding one i.e. the Oreo Sesame, which is black sesame ice-cream blended with Oreo cookies. Predictably it was a bit too sweet and heavy.Ambience : Love it love it love itService : Pleasant, welcoming and efficientPrices are a bit steep but the fusion sushi is great."

One of the most top selling stalls is Lai Heng, which is a stall run by an aunty and a few of her sons. The Kway Tiao served here is one of the best that I've tasted, as it's not too dry with a good amount of sauce that isn't just water added at the end of preparing the dish. The noodle used is soft and thick, and they found a way of frying it such that it doesn't disintegrate or break up into tiny pieces in the wok. This means it's a lot easier to eat without having to literally scoop bits and pieces into your mouth, and also you get more flavor while chewing it instead of tasting more of the egg and pork lard used as seasoning. My only gripe is how slow the service sometimes is, and how the aunty always seems to get at least 1 in 5 orders mixed up, resulting in even more delay trying to figure out what went wrong. But people do make mistakes, and people do grow old. At least the wait was worth it!"

There were no spritely char kway teow nympths to greet me upon my visit to the lau par sat outlet, however - but that did not stop the food from tasting good. Firstly, note that Lau Par Sat is, by its location and set-up, very much geared towards the tourist crowd. Hence expect higher prices and less authentic food quality. I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, that my $3.50 netted me a rather large portion of the local dish. I felt the char kway teow was well-fried, with just the right amount of sweet sauce. The cockles, while fresh and plump, were few and far between, however. What gives this just an average score, in my opinion, is the lack of a distinct ""wok"" flavor one would find from the best of the best CKT stores. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."

Both sandwiches came with generous portion of filling (mine with lots of smoked salmon pieces on creamy dill sauce) and it sure filled me up until dinner. Unfortunately, the sandwiches are only available on weekdays and they have an entire different menu on weekend and dinner. On my second visit, it was a Saturday post gym brunch with my friend. I ordered the smoked salmon (again!) and scrambled eggs served on sourdough, while my friend ordered bacon and egg served on a mini baguette. While the dishes were executed perfectly, I thought the price was slightly on a higher side for brunch food. We paid almost $30 each for a main and a drink, hence I minus one star for this review. Even the dinner price ranges from $10 to $15 only. That's bizarre when it should be the other way around.  The café is open every day - Mon to Fri until 9pm, and weekends until 4pm, so swing by if you're around the area and give it a try. I'm sure you'll like it as much as I do."

The sandwiches are cute and tasty and served fresh even during the rushiest of lunchtime rushes.My companion and I couldn't go past the steak sarnie. Let's face it, who can?This bad boy features grass fed cut steak, amazing sautéed mushrooms, onion, mixed greens and an in-house tangy steak sauce to round out all those flavours.To finish up we shared the Coconut cocowhip (think low-fat ice cream/yoghurt) which was a perfect end to the meal to cleanse the palate and refresh us both from the simmering SG heat.For a lunchtime haunt Sarnies is highly recommended.

If I come here again (though I probably will not), id just get coffee & hang out here! Seating is limited as mentioned in other Yelp reviews with 2 longer benches & tables seating 6 ppl, and a few more tables for 2. Service was friendly, and the iced latte ($5) I ordered was good!! It had a strong espresso taste, the way I like it. The food unfortunately was lacklustre. We ordered 2 Thai disco spaghetti & 2 aglio olio. I expected a fusion dish of Thai basil beef with pasta but unfortunately it wasn't great. The texture of the spaghetti was kind of rubbery, and perhaps another type of pasta would be better suited to enhance the taste more. The beef was the sort of minced beef in bolognese, and was quite salty. The spiciness and vaguely tom-yum taste was there, but that was all. From trying my friend's portion, the aglio olio seemed pretty solid and garlicky with a generous serving of prawns, so perhaps it's the better choice. Another table ordered the satay chicken and it was three sizable slabs of grilled chicken (with no sides though). We also tried to use the Entertainer 1 for 1 app for main courses, and they only allowed 1 use of it I.e only 1 dish was free for the 4 of us (not 2 dishes)."

The food and drinks menu are full of variety and can bend to any taste. However, it is small, and you can easily walk straight past it. Heck, we almost did.

I have allowed my curiosity to build up until one morning last week when I found myself particularly free and decided to venture inside Sarnies.As i pushed the door and stepped in, I seem to have walked from Telok Ayer to England, perhaps some cute little cafe in East London. I could not help notice that the overwhelming majority of the clientele is angmoh and just a second ago, I was surrounded by the laughter of uncles enjoying their kopi at the kopitiam next door so wow! that was a bit unexpected.The set up is simple, there is a huge counter where you order and get your food and drinks and then a few tables and chairs against the wall and filling up the rest of the limited space.  A lot of people seem to opt for the outdoor seats which is a pretty good spot for people watching on the busy strip of telok ayer.  Having quickly scanned the menu on the board, I decided to get the salmon cream cheese bagel since I have not had a bagel for a while (actually never in Singapore to be accurate).  I was a bit disappointed that I could not choose the type of bagel. It is definitely not cheap, my bagel came at a cost of almost S$10 and with a flat white that brings the total damage to 14. I mean, to be fair, the bagel is huge and if you are willing to pay 10 for a sandwich in the cbd this is acceptable but still, $14 for breakfast seems a bit on the high side.  I opted to bring my bagel back to the office since the place is too packed.  Delighted to find that they have taken the time to wrap my bagel up in foil so by the time I sat down at my desk and opened the wrapping, it's still nice and warm.  The bagel itself is pretty good, soft and smooth cream cheese that blends well with the salmon and the portion is quite generous.  I really enjoyed it so quality wise I cannot complain. I heard their brunch menu is pretty good so will come back and try."

I have tried both the Caesar salad (good yoghurty dressing with some herbs) and the Halloumi salad (too salty!) here, and I have heard the bread is great too.  The Caesar portion is large but I still do not think it is worth the price, unless you're itching to spend $15-$17 for a salad!

Missed the day menu by 2 hours (I was there at 6). But the dessert special (churros) convinced me to stay. It's one of those treats that are so difficult to find in Singapore that I always jump at the chance to try some whenever the opportunity arises, although previous attempts have been somewhat dismal.Churros took a bit long to arrive (from my seat facing the kitchen, it seemed as though this applied to all the food in general) but exceeded my expectations. For just $8 (disclaimer: I consider any reasonably-sized dessert priced below $25 affordable.... Unless its just a slice of cake), I got 5 large sticks of churros. These were nice and crisp on the outside and perfectly moist within, substantial but not too dense. It came with a generous cup of chocolate sauce for dipping in, and some salt at the side. Tip: dip the churros in the chocolate, then dab on a bit of salt. The interplay between the sweet and savory flavours when you do that makes the dessert so much more interesting!Appreciated the service, I was there alone and the staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome, by engaging me in polite conversation and constantly checking if there was something else I needed (and sharing their thoughts about the churros!)

My favourite has got to be the steak because they added mustard and makes the meal so tangy and yummy especially with my favourite mushrooms too.Moving on to desserts, the brown little square of brownie is my favourite as it is so chewy and full of flavour, and they sized it just right so you would not get sick of the cake after awhile. Best of all it is not too sweet, just the right amount of chocolate and sweetness.Overall i think they sell value for money food with the right portion and price. Very good choice for a good dinner."

The food delivers, and the service is way above-par for Singapore, especially for a casual spot.My favorites include:- Pesto chicken salad (I have this for lunch on a weekly basis)- Brunch muesli bowl with yogurt and honey (it is to DIE for)- Steak sandwich (or any of the sandwiches, really)The Sarnies folk have also been kind enough to put together a hodgepodge of side dishes into one breakfast entree for me: scrambled eggs, sliced tomato, grilled mushrooms, avocado, and the fabulous Sarnies toasted bread.

Prices a little steep. A sandwich or salad ranges from about $13-$15, and an iced tea is a staggering $7. That said, the sandwiches and salads that I've had have been HUGE. Like, too big to put in your mouth HUGE for the sandwich (yeah that's what she said) and I was surprised I was STILL EATING HUGE for the salad. So I've seen the steak sandwich, the roast chicken sandwich, and the chicken pesto salad first hand, and they're all huge. A main in and of themselves huge. Worth the price? Ehmmmmm close. Portions wise definitely, quality wise really on the border definitely.I highly recommend the pesto chicken salad. Chicken pesto salad. Whatever. There're mushrooms, pesto, TONS of chicken, plenty of greens, cherry tomatoes, and a big slab of bread. You'll notice I've been using a lot of capitalisation in this review. Portions here just FEEL LIKE THAT. IN YOUR FACE. As for their $7 iced teas, it's pricey, but they are quite delicious. The green tea with honey and ginger, the orange with cinnamon are both subtly flavoured and very thirst-quenching. Okay, a little wallet hurting, but I like iced tea so I've usually been able to convince myself that it's worth it. (It's not, not really... I'm really good at lying to myself.)The coffee's decent, but the staff. The staff are friendly, and really cool. They really try to engage you, they make sure to smile, and it really feels like they're having fun as they work through the lunch crush. So if you're in the area and a little stumped for what to eat, I'd give Sarnies a try. They're a little pricey, but it's a very very pleasant experience."

My greek salad was mot well spun resulting in alot of water in the bowl, making the vegetable soggy and unpleasant. However, the service was commendable. We reflected the problems, and they were taken back, and replaced. We even had a free muffin on the house with a staff checking if the replacement was okay.Perhaps it wasn't a good day that we had visited since most items sold out by the time we reached there.

Very private with quick and efficient service. There is a good mix of local and Korean staff, so no fear of any awkward gesturing and language barriers during your meal. It's located just nearby Raffles Place which means a mostly office crowd and and quiet atmosphere for lunch.

Prices are crazy high, but I guess that's to be expected along the water, with gorgeous views of the hotel/casino. I happened to come on national day, and all the tables were reserved for later in the evening, but the staff did accommodate us and let us know we'd only have a short time to eat/drink before the reservation. The menu has a good selection of food and beverages. Again, prices are a little crazy. My passion fruit iced tea was $10 and alcoholic beverages range from $18-$25. They do have ""happy hour"" but it's only for one particular drink each day. On the day I was here, happy hour only applied to whisky. Lol.

The steak frites is delicious with the truffle fries and bearnaise sauce. Drinks are not watered down and juices are refreshing.Note: Service can be a bit slow.

Best part? They operate till late, 3am on a Friday night! Go for their signature truffle burger. I love how the beef patty integrates so well with taste of the cheese! Always looking forward to the burger. Ask for truffle fries if U're in for a little more truffle! However I would say that the standard and portion has dropped some fair bit. A pity but still good on the taste buds. Also ordered their buffalo wings with spiciness on a scale of level 2. Not too spicy for locals but definitely a bomb for foreigners. Disappointment of the entire meal was... The buffalo wings were uncooked!! Didn't ask for a change as the staffs looked under-manpowered. Overeasy Fullerton was quite obviously under staffed, but can't be helped as they're popular, sporting a large crowd with guests queuing for tables on a Friday late night! Had their chicken BLAT burger too, was quite appetising with the soury mayonnaise. The mayonnaise taste very much like the same kinda mayonnaise we can easily find from our 'neighbourhood' cafe haha.There's a lovely draw to this place. Maybe It's the droopy lightings. Maybe it's The 'hype' atmosphere and airiness of this overeasy chain. It's quite relaxing, u can watch MBS's laser show here too as it's right smack ooposite from MBS!"

What happened was really disappointing - it started raining and everyone just fled from their tables. We were all standing in the sheltered area. Plates, cutlery, glasses and beer bottles were still standing soaking the rain while the waiters hurried shifted the tables in one-by-one. It was almost amusing seeing them frantically trying to make sure the customers didn't run away without paying, and also to re-seat the customers who left stranded.Among the two of us, we shared two plates of mini burgers (I think it was 6 burgers on a plate), a caesar salad and a prawn pasta. I got an Asahi to go with the food. We first ordered a steak but the order didn't come after we had finished everything. My friend was gathering exasperated by the inattention of the waiters; we changed the order into another plate of mini burgers.Well, he really did enjoyed those burgers, which I hear is famous over here at Overeasy. I found them to be just okay - i like burgers with leafy salad, tomato, cheese and all. These burgers only had a patty (it was like a cut of steak and pretty juicy, though slightly too cooked for my liking) enclosed with two buns and a toothpick to hold it together.The salad was just okay, I think I can make better salad lolCan't remember what the white sauce on the pasta was but the prawns were really fresh! It was moderately okay, and it did remind me of the copious amounts of pasta I used to eat (and make myself) when I was in the States.The bill came up to 50+ per person. A little ex, but considering the nice location (you can see the whole marina bay front from the dining tables outside), it would still recommend this place."

Won't it be boring to have one kind of green in the salad, in terms of mouthfeel and taste? At least that is what we thought. Midway through, we changed to outdoor seats.

They've got a great outdoor seating area as well, and I generally prefer getting a place out here because, unfortunately, Overeasy's indoor space tends to get as cacophonous as a dim sum restaurant. It gets incredibly loud in here, what with the loud music and patrons straining to have a conversation over it. For your sanity and comfort, I strongly recommend getting a place outside, but it does get crowded very quickly on weekends, so try to head down in the early evening or call ahead for a table."

That warranted much worry as it meant I had only 16 hours to show them how awesome Singapore was. I initiated them to my lovely home country with an epic night-out in the BING style ... and kick-started my chain of bar/club-hopping with OverEasy - the first place which came to my mind!OverEasy is definitely my favourite chill-out bar in downtown Marina Bay. It is lovely both indoors (with a live DJ on most nights ... darkish romantic ambience) and outdoors. The crowd is a right mix of local and expat yuppies (the crowd DOES contribute a lot to a place's ambience and 'feel'). Get a table (there are couches or high tables) outdoors ... and sip your cocktail or wine while admiring the magnificent Marina Bay Sands. Be here at either 8:00PM or 09:30PM daily to catch MBS' light and wonder show from the comfort of your couch/stool (my touristy friends were quite in awe)!Drinks are priced quite decently as well. Good place to have a civilised drinks catch-up with friends before hitting Butterfac next door!

One of my favourites is the Little Creatures pale ale, which isn't stocked at many places (I picked this taste up from The Plain, of all places).Overeasy also do surprisingly good food. I know their burger comes highly recommended, as do their slides, especially when the market closes below a certain index (then they go for $1!). I went for lunch once and enjoyed the breeze as I dug into the most perfect bowl of truffle mac and cheese with mushrooms. It's hard to imagine how something that sounds so simple can taste so amazing. I don't think it's just the 'whole truffle oil makes everything magic' idea, because the cheese was toasted to such perfection, topped with some crumbs to add a crazy mix of texture to the whole dish. The mushrooms were pretty good as well, not the cheap button mushroom sorts, but the nice kind you'd expect from a restaurant. Loved it so much. a Five-star dish if I've ever had one. Must try!"

We were a little disappointed by the selection of wine listed under premium wine.  We also ordered a bottle of sparking water to help ease spicy food later.Cucumber salad with garlic was crunchy yet tender.  Fresh cumber mixed with red chili and garlic sauce was very good, after we finished eating cucumbers, we kept the sauce to use it later for other dishes.Asparagus appetizer was cooked well and it also went good with the chili garlic sauce we kept from the cucumber salad earlier.Steamed Sea bass was so moist and tender, sauce used to flavor the fish went really well with sea bass.  In fact, we ate every edible parts of the fish.  The fish was that good.We also had their famous chili crabs. They were good but it seems like all chili crabs taste the same. We'd had chili crabs from other restaurants in Singapore, and I thought all I had so far tasted the same.  Since the chili crabs were a little spicy for me, we ordered several buns to ease my spiciness in my mouth.  We were trying to stay away from carbohydrates but this bun was so yummy, I ended up eating 3 of them.  Eating chili crabs brought back so many good memories I spent in Singapore in the past. I think I had chili or black pepper crabs at almost every visit to this country.  Must have in Singapore, right?Service was excellent.  The server exchanged serving plates for each dish.  When we started eating chili crabs, she kept coming back with more wet towels and more plates to keep our table and hands as clean as possible.When we finished eating, we were very pleased with the quality of food served here.Free WiFi here - ask the server for password"

I had a few lunch meetings here last year and the food was memorable. So much so that I can wax lyrical despite having eaten tons of over the top Cantonese meals as a Cantonese daughter. My love for Cantonese food only extends to good soups, zi char and modern Cantonese fine dining. I loathe eating the traditional 8 course parade of abalone, braised vegetables yaaawn. Hence Jing by reputation was already on my good books.Jing has a modern feel to it, with a gold and moss green scheme offsetting the brown flooring. The private room I've dined in is spacious and has good acoustics so you're not craning your neck to hear the presenter at the opposite end of the table. The contemporary aesthetic pervades the menu, which Chef Yang (formerly from Pine  Court) sending out some familiar Cantonese dishes with a modern twist. The perennial Peking duck ( I still haven't figured out why Cantonese restaurants serve Peking duck) skin is served with pan seared foie gras and caviar, which tastes incredibly rich compared to the watermelon and foie gras at Majestic. As I am against killing sharks for their fins, I thought the use of sharks bones for soup both maximized the lost of life and produced a wonderful deep, milky broth. The crispy fried fish with soy sauce was very fresh and had great texture, while the crystal prawns were equally fresh, crunchy and evenly coated with wasabi mayo. To end the meals, lobster noodles was in order and trust me, you will not regret ordering these noodles done to perfection, despite what I imagine to be a pretty hefty price tag. The cream of avocado dessert with coconut or vanilla ice cream is also unusual yet refreshing. In all, you won't go very wrong bringing family or work meetings to this restaurant."

That's $10, no pluses.I like the beef tacos and soup of the day ($2), while the Cajun chicken salad does the job. Several friends have tried the yellowfin tuna salad (which comes with a good deal of fish) and loved it. Plus I always see pastas getting munched, which means even if you're carb-phobic, these calories are probably worth it. The grilled salmon is on the small side and depending on how the chef is that day, it can be really greasy.If you get here early, you get a seat in an air-conditioned, lively restaurant. Water is free (can't believe we have to state that but it's not a forgone conclusion with salad bars these days) and the food arrives quickly *most* of the time.

It does, however, mean you can buy a round of drinks for friends without having to take out a second mortgage. The snack menu is okay, though skip the ""cheese"" plate and instead focus on basics like edamame and fries. The ""nachos"" are wrongly named - they're actually just chips and salsa, but the quality was good and was a great crowd pleaser.

It was amazing the number of options the CBD crowd gets for dinner. The Mad Poet is the new kid on the block there, inspired by watering holes in New York.I was surprised to see how empty it was as compared to the rather packed &Sons next door (had a taste of it at Savour 2014). Well, both Mad Poet and &Sons are gastropubs but the former is American, while the latter serves up Venetian ciccheti, which is a novelty in Singapore. Perhaps that's why the Mad Poet has been neglected. But hey, don't write it off as yet. Comfort food is always what we go back to isn't it?An extensive drinks menu is available to go with the food. There's a good selection of European and Asian craft beers e.g. Old Speckled Hen and Wychwood Hobgoblin from the UK, and Hitachino Nest Red Rice and Yona Yona from Japan. I enjoyed the refreshing Death & Resurrection, a Caribbean white rum infused with cumin and shaken with Japanese yuzu.The best kinda bar bites are those that are fried to a crisp, with lotsa flavors. The Tempura Mushrooms were quite perfect and we loved the really light and crunchy batter that was paired with a truffle aioli.More crunchy bites but here's one that really packs a punch, the Jalapeno Poppers ($10). I thought these jalapenos were harmless, like the many that i've tried in Singers. Instead, i felt the blood rush to my head and i momentarily lost it for a bit. But yea. piquant peppers with creamy cheese stuffing and salsa are possibly the best beer food.I liked the Buffalo Wings as well. It's hard to find decent ones in Singapore (not too spicy nor sour). My only complain is the accompanying blue cheese dip wasn't pungent enough.The Smoked Duck Breast ($18) was also a great side/main. I haven't had any smoked duck that left an impression on me until Mad Poet came along. Tender and succulent slices of smoky red meat with the perfect balance of sweet and savory.For something more substantial, there's the Mad Burger ($23) which is made with a Wagyu beef patty. The burger is a little on the bland side though.If you work in the area, Mad Poet does a really affordable lunch menu that is priced at $10 nett. Think pastas and hearty sandwiches with various fillings such as cajun chicken, smoked salmon and roast beef. It also makes a decent spot to down a couple after work."

The food was served up very quickly despite the long line out front, within 10 minutes or so. Excellent service, friendly staff who were helpful with their recommendations. I did not expect the burger to be so superb - indeed it surpassed all my expectations. The fresh beef patty was juicy and succulent, served with very fresh, crisp vegetables, an entire slice of pickle on the side, and a generous amount of sauce and cheese. Even the buns were fluffy and nicely toasted. I especially liked that I was given the option to change my fries to sweet potatoes fries instead, a delicious and somewhat healthier choice for those who are watching their carbs. Triple-O's also has a happy hour for the Shenton Way crowd, so I chose a beer and fries combo upgrade by topping up a mere $6 for a refreshing cold beer to enjoy with my burger. Happiness in my belly. :)"

For the amount of money that we forked out for every of the dish, it was certainly only worth half of the price. The eggplant was tasteless, the beef carpaccio was super bland and it was served 'on the rock'. What a gimmick. That rock served no purpose. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Just a lump of heavy black thing in the middle of the table with beef covering the top, and we really felt like we had Lady Gaga from the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards chopped and served to us on the table. It looked gross, unappetising and marginally unhygienic. How do you wash that black rock? What is it made of?! Is it porous and what kind of minerals are in there that may have transferred across to the beef and is that even what our body needs? What about any kind of detergent that you may have used to wash that lump? Any residue there? Uh-huh, take that black rock away. If that black thing is demanding the dish to be $45, take it away and please lay the meat better on a bohemian crystal platter instead. It'll look more deserving to get people forking out the doe, maybe. The only thing that gave that beef carpaccio some kind of taste was the green spicy sauce/puree/paste thing that was sprinkled all over it. It's that same green thing appeared on the egg plant dish as well as the on-the-house dipping yoghurt that came with the 3 small squares of focaccia. The menu says that if you want more, it is subject to availability. What precious 3 tiny pieces of focaccia that the restaurant might just run out of it. Are you kidding me?! You're a restaurant, so, go make more focaccia, or cross the road to some Cold Storage and get some more, toast it and serve it, for goodness sake. We seem to be at the mercy of your poorly supplied on-the-house focaccia that seems to happen for every meal serving, as it's permanently stated on the menu! The calamari that was tossed with a small variety of herbs seemed to be basic and extremely overpriced. They must have served us squid that was swimming in a 24 carat tank and the herbs were meticulously plucked from the garden of Eden. A dish that is simple, like it's been taken from the Basic Cooking 101 book. After all those, we finished off with the blue crab pasta. Was really hoping this dish would just pick things up for us. Just wait. The menu says the crab is so fresh that it melts in our mouths. So it did, for the crab. How hard is it to find fresh crabs? - you wouldn't want us to get a bout of food poisoning by serving us crab that has been lying about dead for days, right? The pasta on the other had... was under cooked. That pasta certainly refused to melt in our mouths even if we kept it there fermenting in our saliva for a week! The taste of the whole dish was... like every other - bland. What is it with this restaurant and bland, yet expensive food?! The taste of the dish was just the blue crab and not much else. Some green stuff around to make it a smidge spicy, but overall, it was really a basic, simple meal that even my Thermomix can do a better job in 20 minutes. I am sorry, I am not being rude or unkind. We really did have high hopes for this restaurant but we left feeling underwhelmed and robbed of our hard earned money."

If you make a reservation, they'll have a beautifully hand written welcome note waiting for you at your table.Staff is extremely attentive and friendly, service and fast and prompt. Recommendations are always spot on and their seasonal specials are always ""WoW"".My favorites ""must-order"" at every visit to Katanashi-an:1) Bamboo Sake - cold home-crafted sake is smooth and served in bamboo bottle and cups.2) Seared Salmon - fresh salmon sashimi slices lightly dribbled with mayo and seared right in front of you, finished with a hearty topping of salmon roe. Every slice heavenly melts in your mouth.3) Air dried Chicken - a must try for all chicken cutlet lovers. Air dried to seal in the taste, succulent and flavorful with crispy chicken skin.4) Tuna Avocado - Tuna sashimi mixed with avocado and a touch of wasabi, served on small crispy biscuits. One of the all time favorite appetizers.5) Ebi Tempura Mayo - Perfectly fried Ebi Tempura topped with light mayo and soft boiled egg. Normal Ebi Tempura just doesn't cut it for me after my first taste of this King of Ebi Tempura6) Seasonal Special - Grilled Squid with mayo ebiko paste. This dish is to die for, squid is grilled to perfection, tender and flavorful, that's brought to a new dimension with the yummy ebiko mayo dip. If this dish is available, never pass it off.All the dishes are beautifully plated, fit for a TV program and magazine. Price is reasonable to come on a regular basis.

Just watching all the vendors cook their food over the grill is a cool experience. The prawns were cooked perfectly and not dry from the grill. The beef was also nicely cooked. Chicken can be a little dry, but they also give you a sauce to dip the satay in. Lastly, be sure to bring napkins! Like most hawker centers, they don't supply this.

They now use those buzzer devices (you know, those that ring and light up when your order is ready) but they don't always work.Atmosphere - it's pretty easy to get seats during off peak hours. It's air-conditioned and family-friendly.Be mindful that the cashiers sometimes overcharge if you're swapping the default drinks for the combo meals. I wouldn't say the service is /bad/ but it could definitely use a lot of improvement. Very good food, nonetheless."

It is conceptualised as a coffee-shop, where customers won't pay neither the dreaded service charge nor tax. Instead, customers are encouraged to get a ""proper"" drink at the bar, since drink sales are what pays for the service crew. That explains the 15-dollar pints.Nothing can go wrong when you have three kitchens with very different kinds of food, and this is a good example. The three kinds of food being served are Thai, North Indian and Western. So far I've tried the Thai and North Indian, which is my favourite (since I'm such a sucker for Indian food). The good thing about this kind of variety is that different cravings can be satisfied on a single visit.The food is good and prices are quite affordable. Drinks are a bit overpriced but, as explained above, it's for a good reason. The staff members are friendly and attentive, though at times they seem overwhelmed.

I have not sampled the Western food but I have been pretty happy with both the Indian and the Thai food. Neither is any OMG-experiences but both are well above average and at very decent prices.I like the relaxed atmosphere here and they have always been very friendly and service-minded so it has been pleasant to visit here. The good food is complemented by a beer selection of craft beers that is perhaps not amazing but also well-above what many places have. The fact that they also do not automatically add a service charge is another plus in my book.What is however not a nice experience is the men's room.

We really enjoyed the curry although we found the outside seating uncomfortable as there are no cooling fans that work. Since this experience, we always get a take away.

In this case, I was the only sober person in our group. Upon learning Spize was a diner-like chain that existed only in Singapore and served a myriad of local specialties, I crammed everyone into a taxi and off we went.The restaurant is a good size; spacious enough for various groups and just enough breathing room to not feel like it was overly cramped. More importantly, the ventilation was on point. Cold enough to dry our sweat, but not enough to chill our food. Singaporean air con is right up there with the best.After 2AM, it was full of young people who were soaking up their alcohol filled night with all sorts of foods. After a small wait, my group and I were seated and the staff was running around just to fulfill orders. Sadly, it meant that there was a longer wait for us than we wanted. After being passed up several times, we had to flag the waiter down just to get our orders in.Once the food arrived, it was decent, but fairly unmemorable in comparison to the local options I've had during my stay. (#1) We had ordered a number of things: nasi goreng ayam, fried beef kway teow, egg + onion roti, along with tall glasses of water. The nasi goreng initially seemed like the winner but it was bland without the hot sauce. The noodles of the kway teow were nice and greasy and the beef was tender enough despite looking overcooked. I want to try other roti combos next time, this one was pretty subpar.It won't be the last time I'm in Singapore and given my track record, I have a feeling I'll be back at a Spize location sooner than later. Hopefully I'll have a better food experience to report.____________(#1) Maybe I just needed to be a tad more drunk. #samelevel"

First time lunch in here; Served by Mr. R**i aka Store Manager. Main intention to have his opinions for their specialties (trying new stuff). Asked him difference between Magee and Mee goreng. But, his response was ""We have been selling all these food for 13years! Is this ur first time? Where are you from? Most Indo**** order prata... If you order hot water and cold water will be charge $0.60, ok?"" Errrr...... This is store manager we are talking about! I ordered additional food with his staff which is very helpful in giving us his suggestions and TELL us that food pics are the most recommendation. No doubt on food but seriously Mr. R**i?!?

Plaster prata is a hit or a miss here, sometimes I feel like sending my plaster back so that they could give me a beautiful yolk but they are pretty busy most of the times I visit. One of their nasi goreng is quite delicious, especially with the accompanied samballll. The iced teh limau, which is iced lemon tea and teh halia are pretty good as well. What I dislike from here is probably the smokers' corner and the dust from the road. But guess what? I have been successfully avoiding these two since I found out they have delivery services and satisfied my crazy hunger pangs at 3am! :D I could then sleep soundly without being grouchy.

It is a bit more expensive than a hawker stall but worth it in the extra execution in the food.

The most extensive range of late night food you could probably ever find, and when you're tipsy, or tired, or happy, the food will still taste great no matter what. Even sober, the food here doesn't disappoint, and while it's no Tony Roma's or Chilis, but they do offer a great variety of Western and local wares to keep you satisfied.I am a big fan of the fact that they server truffle fries here. Truffle fries! At 3 am in the morning, truffle fries are a godsend. Haha jokes aside, I have seasoned truffle fries connoisseurs tell me that the ones served here aren't half bad at all. Their food options cover the whole spectrum, from your fish'n chips, to prata, they have almost anything you could think of whilst inebriated. Or sober.Here are a couple of the dishes I have tried which are mention worthy and some you should definitely try when visiting Spize. Their roti john chicken special - cheese, mushroom, chicken goodness on bread. Their maggi goreng seafood pattaya - maggi, with seafood and a tinge of orange spicyness wrapped in a hot omelette, nuff said. Their truffle fries - as mentioned above. Their fish and chips - fried crispy goodness with tonnes of fries. Their bangers and mash - good ol' sausages with creamy mashed potatoes and an equally tasty gravy to match. Their nasi goreng - they've got multiple variations of fried rice, be sure to give them all a try. There's a reason why there's more than one type. I could go on but you get the jist. I think the magic in this place is that it comes alive late at night, and is always full of sights and sounds way past midnight. Fantastic for eating those post party blues away. Also fantastic for drunk people watching at 4 am in the morning when you are hungry and cannot go to bed. Their only downside, when it gets crowded, be sure to expect that orders will slip through the cracks, and you may end up waiting for some time before those truffle fries finally arrive at your table."

Instead, head straight to Spize which is so nearby, will still be open and has food that tastes good whether or not you're intoxicated. The menu is really extensive, as is the seating. As a vegetarian, there are plenty of options - the usual nasi goreng and mee goreng (both about $4, as there are a few kinds) can all be done veggie style, though you might want to repeat your order a few times to make sure they get it right (this goes for anywhere, really). More favourites are the drinks like ice limau (lime) and longan. The Blue Longan drink is awesome as well. It's basically just processed fruit and colouring, but it's exciting. Because it's blue. Who needs cocktails, right?"

And it's a great niche to cover because, let's face it, when you're drunk you could probably pick up a yoghurt-lid slathered in bird shit off the ground and devour it as if it were three-star Michelin fare. Hooray for drunks!I will admit that I'm drunk almost every time I come here. And I come here a lot. It's basically a ritual. I don't care that there are other late night options in Singapore, such as Geylang and what have you. What I want late at night after drinking is prata + teh tarik and Spize is the most dependable and easily accessible option. The food is pretty good guys, come on. And you get to be in the company of your fellow drunks and party goers. Always fun! We even get the benefit of fairly dim lighting so that we don't have to be subjected to the seemingly rapid deterioration of our fellow patrons under harsh fluorescent lighting (exacerbated by our impending sobriety).By the way, even though I order the exact same thing every time I come (cheese egg prata and teh tarik less sweet), I have been very pleasantly surprised by the crayfish.

Drawbacks: the prices are pretty steep for an Indian-Muslim place (probably because of it's location) and parking is problematic.

Take your pick. Most of the fried rice or noodle dishes here are pretty standard. Satay here is decent, but pricier than most other hawker centres. In fact, all the local dishes here cost a little more than average.There's also a western menu available, but I've never tried any of those dishes. Neither have my friends, so I can't really comment on that.The toilets here are usually filthy, and the floor is really oily. Tread carefully, especially if you are inebriated. They set up rows of tables and chairs on the walkway outside their shop, and the next 3 shops on either side.Parking around here is a real pain when you've got the post-party crowd in.

Most customers seemed to had takeaway orders. Some ordering up to 5 bowls to go!Check out the amount of fried fish! It's a mountain of fried fish to be honest!I like my fried fish to separate from the soup so that it doesn't turn soggy. They have about 6 pieces of fried fish. On top of the noodles they were generous with the fried omelette. Using pure oil at high temperatures and egg white you get this crispy brown, light and fluffy texture! Next up the fish. I was so disappointed as the fish wasn't crispy or hot. It was soggy despite being dry! I should've realized when I saw that mountain of fried fish that the pieces must've been sitting outside for a long while before being served to customers. I've eaten a lot of fried fish noodles and this was literally a sad bowl of fried fish noodles.The Ee mian tasted okay and since there's the omelette on top as garnishing, they didn't bother to provide you with an egg in the soup.All in all, a rather disappointing meal in a hawker centre.

We were not told we had to scarf down our food and beer with 6ppl in 1.5hrs! They insisted that they told us even though they obviously didn't. They even took our order of a glass of red wine and a pint of beer and expected us to be done in 5mins.The most outrageous part was when they decided to waive the beer and glass of wine and rather take back the beer that had already been consumed, DIRECTLY from my friends hand and throw it out rather then let him finish it since they waved it so they can chase us off their premises.This was one of the most shocking displays of service I have ever encountered with a bill close to $200.Oh well.. There will always be service staff who behaves this way. Lesson learnt."

I would say that I prefer it more flavourful (more salt pls) but hubby tried and said it's me. :PGaint Pizzas - we had 2 giants so that 4 flavours altogether. The pizzas were very well received by everyone.  Kids like the square shape pizzas they cut them into and happily dug in with their hands. We were a part of 5 adults and 4 kids, and still had to doggie-bag quite a bit of pizzas. Oh well, hubby was happy to be able to have more pizzas for the subsequent days.

This time, we decided to make a reservation and have a proper dinner there.We got the calamari and pancetta pizza to start while waiting for one of our friends to arrive ... the calamari was pretty decent and went well with the mayo and salsa dip provided. The pancetta pizza was pretty good except we would have preferred the egg to be runny like the one from Spizza. Love the peach and banana smoothies! We then proceeded to get the pepperoni pizza and the Amatriciana (linguini with smoky bacon & sautéed onions in zesty tomato sauce) when our friend arrived, before ending off with a tiramisu to share.Everything was pretty good for a casual pizza joint and service was pretty efficient.

Sure, whatever right?We sat down, ticked a bunch of things, which may seem a lot for two people, but I'm a big NOM monster, so who cares?This place does the basic items well and while there isn't anything very OUTSTANDING, the quality of everything is general is very good, which is why I give it 4 stars. 1 less star for expecting me to eat everything in 45 minutes. Especially for serving me my last item at 1137am. We ordered radish cake (yum), char siew noodles (good char siew), har gow (okay), siew mai (okay), steamed yam cake (okay), egg tarts (YUM), char siew polo (okay), chicken feet (YUM), salted egg yolk custard bun (YUM, and flows like a river), fried wantons (delish, remember to ask for salad sauce to go with it, the default sauce is something not memorable). Most dimsum places have a few good items, and the rest is soso. I really love this place's consistency in quality across the board. When I say an item is okay, it does not mean that it is passable. It means that I would eat it. Do I eat a lot of things? Not really. The cost was reasonable, about $70 for two people, which is a lot less than eating dimsum at a hotel on a Sunday. Would I come back? Yes.Come here for dimsum, but call before coming, or face a long wait, or a very rushed brunch."

We ventured bravely into the restaurant, without stopping to ask the lady at reception where our friends were, and promptly got lost in the maze of rooms in this huge complex. The restaurant is mainly made up of private rooms, great if you're dining with a large group of people.Food was great, I had the Century Egg Congee (about $9 and came in a huge bowl), char siew bao, char siew sou (like a pastry), polo bun (HK-style pineapple buns), fried pig's intestines, liushabaos, egg tarts. Didn't try the usual dimsum orders with prawns as I'm allergic to them.Everything I tried was good, certainly one of the better dimsum places I've been too. But special commendation must go to that dish of gold-on-a-plate, FRIED PIG INTESTINES. Ok, it's mainly an acquired taste, only 5 out of 10 in our group actually liked it, but I'm a huge fan and... this was amazing. Crispy and flavourful and the intestines had none of that pungent odour. (Sometimes with the lower-quality ones it becomes exceptionally smelly) Gosh I'm salivating just thinking about it T_T"

I'm certainly not the only one who feels this way about this outlet (or some of their other ones for that matter), going by how difficult it is to get a table from 11.30am-2pm on weekends if you don't reserve in advance. The simple things are done very very well and my picks have more to do with personal preference. For my pork fixes, I love the char siew soh (shared 9 pieces with someone before), char siew noodles and pork belly/siew yoke combination. There is a baked coconut pastry that is all kinds of delicious in the same vein as AG's custard polo bao. I think the siew mai is ok but the giant fried wantons shouldn't be refused (now if only we could have Pontian mee chain's wantons in this size my life would be perfect). The chefs also fry vegetables (you cai) really well . If you're a stickler for cooking, you'll realize the simplest things are the hardest to do and besides the way one of the chefs at Hup Choon does his irresistible broccoli with garlic , Imperial's team is the only other one I like that peels the stems meticulously and blanches/fries the vegetables to a perfect 'al dente'. It's like they make these familiar home style dishes to subtly say ""now THIS is what a chef can do with your humble kailan"". Finally the soups here are pretty good but I don't order them often for lunch and if you have a craving for XO mee pok, I think Summer Pavilion's version has a slight edge.I think I just wrote myself into a dim sum craving.

Service so bad it's almost comic. Staff stood in front of restaurant and approached me saying Sir, very good Indian food.  Come come. And that's the last I see of him. Come in as single. 25% dine in crowd but overrun with dispatch riders picking up to go orders.  Sat down at 8:40 pm Get menu. Order lassi, naan and vindaloo.  8:55 lassi arrives.  Watch maybe 20 to go orders getting picked up.  The 10 or so  diners in the place all had their food when I arrived.  Staff are all huddled in the back talking, not serving anyone except handing bags of to go orders.  9:10 no food. A few diners leave so the MIA staff comes up front to cash register.  I ask where my food is and he says ""on the way sir"".  9:20 a couple comes inn, sits down and orders.  9:25 couple gets served food.  That's it.  40 minutes for naan and vindaloo?  Get up to leave, cancel order and pay for lassi.  Prompts staff to come up and say just 2 more minutes sir.  Tell him I would not enjoy my meal there and leave late and hungry.Maybe the food is good there but the staff are clueless. They clearly put to go orders first.  If I had called food it would have been served faster.  Singapore has great Indian restaurants that provide quality food and service and pay attention to their diners.  This one rates near the bottom....I notice that other reviewers have commented on the Long wait for food.  Others rave about the quality.  Since my patience ran out at 40 minutes I admittedly cannot attest to the quality.  But taking so Long to serve with servers huddling in the back, chatting and handing to go orders and then someone who arrived 30 minutes after I arrived get  served really ruined my appetite."

To be fair, I almost always buy to take it back home so it's lost some crispiness by then. It's served with a really yummy tasty, just right amount of tanginess fish gravy.Tried their prata bomb once but nothing special. Much prefer the one at Fadhiya.They also have a pretty nice selection of rice and dishes, I ordered the mutton on the bone before and that was really tender and softly gnawy. Soup kambing here is not bad but I ordered it with mutton bones coz their usual is with cubes.The teh tarik is super sweet so definitely ask for less sugar. Even my friend with a sweet tooth finds it too sweet.Sometimes they have putu mayam, it's just bought from somewhere but what a great dessert after the spicy savoury dishes.Staff are all nice and cheery and the prata man always has a chat or laugh with me. I usually call ahead and they prepare it for me to do a quick pickup since parking is difficult. Outside is the dreaded jagged yellow line so you gotta be quick!24 hours opening yay but the rice dishes get cooked around 10 or 11 as a few times I came around 11am and the veg was not ready. In this area, I definitely rate this about Spize which super greasy."

R.,lShwcacIvs5i2MYsQHPzMQ,"Jacksonville, FL",5,8/23/2013,"Wow, how can I describe my experience? I am a total steak lover, quite possibly because I'm an Ang Moh and meat is large part of our diet. Finding a good steak in Singapore is not generally easy, and when I have found a new steakhouse here, they're either poor quality or so expensive that I can scarcely afford to pay for the bill! Here's my verdict: Pepper is surely the best steakhouse I have eaten at in Singapore.  Let me say that again: this is the best steakhouse I've eaten at in Singapore! First, the menu has a ton of choices to pick from (perhaps too many), and so I was pleasantly surprised to be so spoilt for choice. After about 10 min of deliberation with my guest, I made a decision to go with the New Zealand grass fed Black Angus beef. I then chose the ribeye cut for just over $60. I'm exceptionally health conscious, but I also enjoy red meat, so it is vital for me to order something that is lean, grass fed, with no artificial things added...so no problem there.The food came out quickly...within fifteen min, which is just right, and as we were taking pleasure in our meals, the manager came over to check on the food, as did the waiter. We were both all smiles. The steak was absolutely delicious, and I enjoyed the french fries too...though I could have taken advantage of a free-flow of steak fries, I was too full to finish my first order...in fact, the meal was so filling that I didn't eat dinner that night! I also didn't get a chance to try their beer this time (it was lunch time and I was working), but I hear positive things about their microbrewery, so that is on my short-list as well. My partner had a seafood pasta with loads of prawns and a pleasant alfredo sauce (I tried a bite, just to be sure!). I'm not sure what restaurant the other reviewer was at, because this was definitely in the top 3 joints I've visited since relocating here Two years ago...and I eat out a LOT! :-)  I've travelled and eaten around the world...so I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about here.  Do yourself a favour, and give Pepper a try."

Having made reservations via Chope, when we arrived we were seated at the non-booth tables at the end of the restaurant. Nothing wrong with that... except that my family all run a little on the short side, with the tallest of us being still under 1.65m. The seats at Pepper Steakhouse, for some odd reason, are rather low relative to the tables, meaning that when we sat down, the table was at chest height. That's not very comfortable when dining. We asked to change to a booth seat, which from our estimation, looked more comfortable in terms of height (ironic, I know). The manager/supervisor told us he didn't have any available tables at that moment, but he'd change us once a table became available, definitely before our mains. Satisfied with that compromise, we ordered. For starters we have the beef tongue (decent, a bit greasy as it's braised, then fried) and the beef carpaccio (also decent, unspectacular). Those came and went... and then eventually our mains arrived. No word of a table change, no sign of anything. Mildly put off, we continued eating.We had three steaks in total, and the New Zealand 'Wakanui' 500g Chateaubriand was excellent. At $78 ++, it was excellent value, and actually one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. Both my dining companions didn't feel their steaks were anything to rave about (one had the 'Savannah' entrecote, and the other the 'Harvey' ribeye), but they did feel tat my steak was much better than theirs. Perhaps the Wakanui is just a better grade of beef. Regardless, this steak was cooked as requested, I asked for it rare and it came beautifully red all the way through, succulent and in no way dry. The outside was seared well, and salted to bring out the flavour of the meat. My brother felt it was a touch too salty, but both my mother and I felt that it was within the 'delicious' range of saltiness.Signature steaks also come with free flow fries, however the thick cut fries were nothing to write home about. Lukewarm, a little bit soggy, they tasted tired and we didn't even finish the portions served, let alone ask for more. We had all asked for Bernaise sauce with our steaks (the sauce is complimentary, which is refreshing since many places charge nowadays), and the Bernaise was competently executed. The flavours were balanced, it wasn't too tart, and went well with the steak. I just felt it important to mention that because I've had some incredibly sour Bernaise sauces in Singapore where the chefs have clearly been a bit too enthused with the tarragon vinegar.One final point of note is that Pepper Steakhouse and Bistro is run by the Pumproom group, meaning that you have access to all of the Pumproom's microbrewery ales and beers. Steak and beer. You can't go wrong.So we never did get that table change that was promised, not all our steaks were that memorable, the fries were unimpressive to say the least, and one of our party who had been seated next to their wine cooler was interrupted throughout his meal every time then needed to pull a bottle of wine out of the chiller. But if you're hankering for an affordable steak and happen to be in the area, the Pepper Steakhouse is worth considering. I'd go back. Maybe."

You can really taste the freshness and high quality ingredients they use here.

I know, I have first world problems.As I have no idea who to order my ramen from, I tried to order one from each stall to taste and see. It helped that I have my family along to con them into eating ramen from the different stalls.King Ramen from Butaou - hubby ate this and he liked it enough. The rich soup is tasty and full bodied. I tried it and it was nice...just not sure if it's my best tasting.Spicy Ramen from Tonkotsu Itto - I like spicy anything so this ramen already win a few more point by being spicy. The soup is rich and tasty too. Ramen from Tonkotsu Itto - daughter ate this and she really liked it. I tasted and can understand why. Same rich and tasty soup goodness here.Garlicky Spicy Ramen from Miyamoto - after tasting all the ramens ordered, I decided I liked this the most as I like garlic, and spice and the generous dose of bean sprouts they throw inside with the ramen. I realised that I needed the bean sprouts to compliment the taste of the ramen, so that it won't be too ger-lat too soon.Nice place to grab a pre-movie meal, easy and fuss-free and tasty. You probably need to come with a group and order 1 ramen from each stall to eat at the same time to figure out what is your favourite ramen!! Good luck!"

Was the drive over worth it? Neh. Broth- its super thick gravy like and just layered with chili oil. I love the spicyness but that's about it. There's no flavor profile to it. Just none.

Previously I went to the Bugis outlet which seemed to have more stalls.Based on my non-scientific survey, I saw 4 stalls and 1 drink stall.Itto - We ordered the tonkotsu special. The difference between this and the classic seems to be 4 slices of thin char siu instead of 1 and an egg instead of none. The price was around $16.50 instead of $11.50. They served in black bowls. It had the thin kind of noodles which I believe is Hakata style (?). I enjoyed the noodles and it reminded me a bit of Ippudo. The soup was richer and saltier than Ippudo..which is fine with me coz I like my ramen soup salty. My favourite shop is Miharu which some complain is too salty (obviously they are not regulars and do not know that to drink it you can ask for a pot of broth to lighten it and make it go further ;). The char siu was very tender. The egg did not look like the seasoning had permeated at all but the texture and doneness was good. Probably not worth the special price unless you have a particular craving.Sukiyaki Ramen - They serve in red bowls. This had quite a special taste to it, being a cross between sukiyaki broth (thicker than it) and ramen. Again we had the special and it had char siu as well as sukiyaki beef slices. The beef slices were quite fatty and were very tender. The char siu was also quite good but I think I slightly prefer Itto's as they were a bit more meat than fat. We really liked the flavour of this soup and ended up using noodles from the white bowl stall (see below) to dip in it.There was a white bowl ramen stall (I forget the name) but I think true ramen lovers should skip this one as it was very light tasting and nothing special. In fact it had a strong taste of beansprouts from the copious amount of beansprouts. The noodles were flat and wider like mee pok. It was a bit doughy for my taste.Bishamon Zero - We ordered a cold tofu and gyoza from here. The gyoza was ok. The cold tofu was topped with fried onions and sitting in what I thought was sauce but turned out to be a sea of chilli oil..it was just too much as I was hoping for something fresher and cold tasting as a foil to all the rich soups.It's nice that some stalls had some side dishes so that it's not ALL ramen but some of the dishes were sold out.Make sure you get the loyalty card chopped for each bowl of ramen. Some of the stalls don't tell you or give it to you."

And the set menus look very appealing, though they all seemed to have at least one item that I'm not a fan of. Had two dinners here, one with a party of three and one by myself. This review covers both. When we arrived as a party of three there was a short queue. After a little wait we were moved to the intermediate waiting area where they have magazines and menus to explore. Good way to make a longer waiting time seem shorter. Service was very quick and precise. Orders are noted on a piece of paper (or pieces of paper in case of separate checks), checked if the order is correct and later on checked if all the ordered items have been delivered. I normally judge a sushi place by the crispiness of the nori, but the only item I had with nori (really) were hand rolls and those are somehow usually always crispy even though other nori items may not. Only one of us had a set menu. It looked really nice, but I can't judge about the taste. I really liked the texture of the salmon and the fact that the tamago wasn't too sweet. The ebi tempura was also very nice. The shrimp meat perfectly cooked. When I revisited this restaurant by myself. I choose to be seated at the bar as that would obviously go faster. The advantage of sitting at the bar is that the food goes straight from the chef's hand to you and you can watch the chefs prepare all the food. Disadvantage is that the conveyer belt keeps moving tempting dishes by at about exactly the right height and distance to grab some more (-;I have had a look at the 'fish market' where they sell all sorts of ready made sushi and fish to be prepared at home. The ready made sushi looked so much better that those of the supermarket on the same floor.

You know how they sometimes serve you sesame dipping sauce at a Chinese hotpot place? It's almost exactly like that, except in this case the udon was drenched in very thick and creamy sesame dressing. It was nice at first but too much after the 4th bite. The place was spacious and comfortable, though. My friends and I ended up staying for almost 3 hours just hanging out.

Not any more. I've patronised Ichiban from day one, when they were first located at Novena, and originally positioned as a mid priced offshoot of Kuriya. I dare say the quality (and quantity) of food and service has gone down the drain. Sashimi is barely fresh. Portions have gotten smaller. And quality of ingredients has become mediocre. Barely value for money as it were. Service is harried at best, occasionally surly. And the kitchen misses orders with a regularity that is - frankly - quite embarrassing. This place is a shadow of its former glory. Its mediocre Japanese cuisine at best, and a bright shining example of all that's wrong with over-expansion and mass market mentality. Only eat here if you've no choice. Still better than other mediocre chain outlets like Sakae Sushi or Sushi Tei. But only by a bit."

I'm also surprised at how efficient the service is, as we usually go in a group of 6 and everyone usually gets their food around the same time.Their bento sets are pretty good; my only complaint is that the amount of food you get can be a bit too much for someone who's not very hungry. My favorite is their aburi sushi; it comes with around 7 pieces and you get a clear soup with it.If you're not one to wait for a mass-market sushi meal, check out their Kuriya takeaway area. (Note: I'm not sure if this is something that I should separately review, as Kuriya and Ichiban share the same space and cash register, but have different names.) They have an amazing variety of rolls, bowls, nigiri, aburi... basically, a lot of what you can order off the menu at Ichiban, and a lot better than what I see at Fairprice and Cold Storage.

Also some staff can't speak English or Japanese!Note that we have lived in Japan for many years. Be wary of the Chicken Saute on the osusume menu - it is actually fried chicken, not sauteed, and is mostly koromo, skin and gristle, very little meat.  The Horenso Salad has over-garlicky salad dressing, it smothered the salad - it is overpriced and they don't mention that there is pork in it (though this is standard in Japan). The tskune is really good but ridiculously small for the prices.

I love the location, but thought it would cultivate a tourist trap. Turns out the chef knows what he is doing. This is one of maybe a handful of times in years that lobster was soft under the fork, perfectly cooked instead of the usual rubbery texture I've come to expect from Singaporean chefs. The snapper was, again, spot on. They made the most of the medium steak with even texture showing perfect control. The chef also knows how to balance salt and seasonings, again something less common here and it took me straight back to the Mediterranean of my youth. Pasta was al dente with a well seasoned and balanced bolognese ragu which I managed to get through despite being full before starting it. Every other table was having pizza so I guess that's what we're trying next.I would have 5 starred it but the Primitivo had very clear volatile acidity (when bacteria trapped in the wine produces acetic acid, leaving a stench of vinegar). This is not an unknown problem with Italian wines and it was still early enough that I could drink it by holding my nose (Primitivo has enough fruit to offset the acidity). But at $12 a glass, in a restaurant where the staff clearly has a trained palate, this is a real shame. It means I won't risk wine at further visits and they will lose the profit I was happy to give them. A bottle of decent Primitivo from 2016 is probably $20-30 to import, hardly a huge hit on the bottom line. I'm sad because it is hard to find a place that cooks meat and especially fish so well, and I was looking forward to pairing it in the future. Tables are relatively close together and the popularity of the restaurant (despite its rating here) meant that it got pretty loud. By 9pm we could not hear each other across the table. I measured an average of 55dB with my phone with peaks at 65dB, about the same as someone drilling through the other side of a wall. Outdoors was better for that reason, despite the excellent presentation of the white tablecloths and fountain behind the dining room."

I can see why their service was deservedly panned on Yelp.

The older generation would probably love this. My grandparents certainly do. The main attraction for my family though is the food. Been here more than 10 times and almost everything we have ordered has been really good.Tonight we had the following dishes:Black fungus in vinegar (cold appetizer) - mainstay for our family. Simple dish but oh so delicious and refreshing. 10/10Cold bitter gourd (cold appetizer) - refreshing and very bitter. I don't personally like this as I don't like bitter gourd, but it's one of my father's favourites. 9/10Sea cucumber w fish maw & abalone - I'm not a fan of this dish as I don't like abalone but the majority of the table liked it alot. Abalone and fish maw was tender, sea cucumber was juicy and plump. This is an individual portion dish. Came with a lot of veg, so you don't need to order a separate veg dish if you don't want to. 7.5/10Salt & pepper spare ribs - my brother loved this dish. Pretty good, Tender, juicy, not oily. 7/10Garlic dou Miao - very sweet 8/10Dan Dan mian - not a fan of this usually, but ordered one portion as someone wanted to try. Wasn't half bad, sauce was rather tasteful.  7/10Deep fried cod with garlic - lovely. Not at all dry like the usual fried fish in Chinese restaurants, very soft and flaky, almost melt in your mouth. Closer to jap gindara teriyaki type of cod texture then the fried Chinese type of fish. Awesome dish.  8.5-9/10Shark cartilage/bones soup  -  Don't eat shark's fin soup, and definitely prefer this instead. Warm, rich and full bodied. Very satisfying. 8/10Cold aloe Vera jelly dessert - refreshing, great end to dinner. Possibly my favorite Chinese dessert. 10/10Total cost was about $700 for 6 pax for tonight's dishes"

I can really understand that view as many of the places around here cater to people with more money than sense and taste but I do not believe that Toby's Estate is one of them. The coffee here is actually really good, they serve excellent filter coffee and the ice coffee is also one of the better ones I have had in Singapore. Espresso based beverages also do not disappoint but I seldom order them since the other coffees are so good and in my view a good filter always is preferable over an equally good espresso based beverage.The food is not bad but a tad bit on the pricey side so I do only eat here when my hunger coincides with an intense need for coffee. Service has always been very friendly here and I can see that as a regular you tend to get certain benefits as I have noticed that when I have been here a lot during periods (when I stayed close by) they always manage to find a seat and also sometimes give some free tasters of some coffee.I can agree with Michelle M that the bathroom set-up is a bit strange but that seems to be the same for several places around there but I never had any issues with it being overly dirty or messy - maybe it is for once the ladies room that looks worse than the men's room :-)"

It wouldn't be so bad if the sun didn't shine through and heating up our area. On the bright side, my friend(nearest to the window)'s coffee remained warm throughout.I ordered scrambled eggs on toasted brioche, $10, with Harrisa sausage, +$4.50. The eggs were tad overdone to my liking instead of runny and creamy. For a moment, I thought I was at McD for Big Breakfast. Very plain and ordinary.Not going back anytime soon since its just another cafe serving plain pricey eggs. But hey, at least they have free wifi. ;)"

I must admit that I am not really used to the cafe culture here in Singapore, namely because they pretty much all have table service (normally I simply go to the counter, order my coffee, and then find a place to sit). This place wasn't all that bad, and the Brooklyn Style that I had was pretty nice. They also made a decent coffee (not that I am a real coffee connoisseur, but I decided that since I was overseas I would try out the coffee in as many places as possible). The service was pretty good, though not the quickest (but I found that that was the case in most places in Singapore anyway - maybe it is not as hustle and bustle as I am used to in Melbourne). It's also a pretty quite part of the city as well, and the riverside view makes it great for the experience."

Soya milk latte- Loved it. It had the perfect nutty taste. 2. Croissant with scrambled eggs & honey bacon- Cindy Q was spot on in her review of the its croissants. It has to be the best croissants I've tasted!!! How on earth did they make it so flaky and crispy??? Magic. The scramble eggs were pretty good but then again how wrong can one go with them. Child's play. The honey bacon on the other hand had an interesting smokey flavor laced with a sweetness that reminded me of candy bacon (Epic Meal Time). It was ok I guess but I think I prefer my bacon savory rather than sweet. Lovely ambiance It's like walking into a cafe in Australia - Chilled, laid back and with a big coffee roaster.  I would love to bring a good book here one day, read it while sipping on my latte and nibbling on those magically croissants! Overall great experience. Perfect for a lazy weekend brunch. Best thing is that they serve brunch till 5pm so for all ya sleepy heads out there who cannot get up in time for a MacD's breakfast, this is perfect."

Shall try that some time soon. Love the old warehouse feel to the area. Very grunge but they have since refurbished and repainted the exterior. We have noted this place some time ago before Toby moved in. Something we noticed about the recent development in the cafe scene is that they all kinda have the same decor. Brick walls juxtaposed with a black, white and wood theme. A little raw, a little unfinished. I'm not complaining because i like it this way. The flooring of my future home would be cement or i would have a cement wall feature.Nice airy space to chill at but my main complain is that there are not enough seats in the house! The concept of communal dining is cool but it's not very comfortable squeezing between different groups of people early in the morning just to get my caffeine fix. The space could be better utilized i feel.The coffee is easy on the palate. I usually don't take coffee without sugar but after having Papa Pahleta's, i concluded that good coffee doesn't require any additional sweetening. I would put this in the same category. Can't say too much about the coffee as my throat was crying for help from the soreness and i think coffee made it worse. :(Ham and Cheese Croissant was really good. The pastry is very light and airy and extremely crispy! I would love for the centre texture to have more pull though. The pastries are outsourced. S said something about it coming from Bread Project. I should just go straight to the source to get my croissant. S had the poached egg with salmon on brioche. My first impression is that it looks a lot like WH's but the brioche is not toasted and this is more buttery and very fluffy. Shall try the brioche with jam next time to get a more accurate feel to the texture. Nicely done eggs but i wouldn't say that this dish is spectacular? Not something i would definitely come back for.W showed up at Toby's after we were about done with our breakfast. He had the Toby's Breakfast- a composition of scrambled eggs, back bacon, roasted tomatoes and peppers and sautéed mushrooms. The eggs sure look runny enough. Shall try this when i feel better. Anyway, it's breakfast till 3pm daily so more incentives to come down. Downside to this place is also the really slow service. They really need to work on getting the coffee and food out faster."

Toby's is located right along the river, which makes it a perfect place to people watch and catch up with friends. It's also a pretty ideal spot to do work at, what with free wi-fi and power outlets. It's interior is dark and inviting, and it's hard to leave the place without feeling satisfied and happy."

Hailing from Australia, this franchise was a sign that our coffee scene is now big enough to sustain an overseas franchise since the Second Wave coffees. What it brought along was a huge space along the Robertson Quay area. It has very high ceilings and a very casual friendly atmosphere. What I really liked was the fact that they are really serious about the coffees. You can tell with the bean bags and apparatuses lying around. They bring in their own beans and there are sampler sets for you to try.The baristas are also very friendly and will speak to you about the coffee if you asked. When we went they have already ran out of food. Generally, try to avoid cafes on Sunday late afternoons if you want food!"

You can tell that most of the patrons here live around the corner, because they all look nice and put together. There were not enough people that looked like a frikken HOT MESS because they miscalculated how far it is from Clarke Quay and walked a good 20 minutes under the brutal sun right after lunch time. (I may or may not be talking about myself....) If it's your first time visiting and you cab it, note that Rodyk St kind of dead ends and looks pretty residential. Keep walking towards Robertson Quay, hang a right and you're there! The first time I stopped by, I ordered a cappuccino and a pastry. I admired the excellent latte art; the pastry was nothing to Yelp about. The second time I visited, I ordered the iced chai latte, and that was an epic fail whale. I kid you not, it was 10% chai at the bottom, 90% milk, and a tall cup full of ice, all for the lovely price of $6. Blech.I also find it strange how they don't have a bathroom inside the shop. You have to go outside around the corner. I actually went to this bathroom, and it explicitly says it's not a public bathroom but only for the residents of the building. Weird. Despite the warning signs, I used it anyways and unfortunately discovered that it needs some maintenance. There were only 2 stalls, and neither of them locked correctly. Overall, decent place to check out if you need to get out of your bubble. Just beware of the bathrooms."

Shall try that some time soon. Love the old warehouse feel to the area. Very grunge but they have since refurbished and repainted the exterior. We have noted this place some time ago before Toby moved in. Something we noticed about the recent development in the cafe scene is that they all kinda have the same decor. Brick walls juxtaposed with a black, white and wood theme. A little raw, a little unfinished. I'm not complaining because i like it this way. The flooring of my future home would be cement or i would have a cement wall feature.Nice airy space to chill at but my main complain is that there are not enough seats in the house! The concept of communal dining is cool but it's not very comfortable squeezing between different groups of people early in the morning just to get my caffeine fix. The space could be better utilized i feel.The coffee is easy on the palate. I usually don't take coffee without sugar but after having Papa Pahleta's, i concluded that good coffee doesn't require any additional sweetening. I would put this in the same category. Can't say too much about the coffee as my throat was crying for help from the soreness and i think coffee made it worse. :(Ham and Cheese Croissant was really good. The pastry is very light and airy and extremely crispy! I would love for the centre texture to have more pull though. The pastries are outsourced. S said something about it coming from Bread Project. I should just go straight to the source to get my croissant. S had the poached egg with salmon on brioche. My first impression is that it looks a lot like WH's but the brioche is not toasted and this is more buttery and very fluffy. Shall try the brioche with jam next time to get a more accurate feel to the texture. Nicely done eggs but i wouldn't say that this dish is spectacular? Not something i would definitely come back for.W showed up at Toby's after we were about done with our breakfast.

Hailing from Australia, this franchise was a sign that our coffee scene is now big enough to sustain an overseas franchise since the Second Wave coffees. What it brought along was a huge space along the Robertson Quay area. It has very high ceilings and a very casual friendly atmosphere. What I really liked was the fact that they are really serious about the coffees. You can tell with the bean bags and apparatuses lying around. They bring in their own beans and there are sampler sets for you to try.The baristas are also very friendly and will speak to you about the coffee if you asked. When we went they have already ran out of food. Generally, try to avoid cafes on Sunday late afternoons if you want food!"

Hindsight, believe or not, should have driven.Finally get to Robertson Quay and we are dodging gobs of free range dogs and kids roaming about the area. Gobs! Clearly this is a very family friendly part of town. Show up to the restaurant on time. There is no record of our reservation. Kind of bugs me, but only kind of. The place is about half full so no big deal. We are seated. There is indoor outdoor seating, a nice sized well stocked bar area and tons of TVs playing a variety of sports. Another plus is the restaurant sits alongside the waterway and you can watch the tourist boats gliding by. Aside from the reservation snafu, service was really top notch. We ordered our food and it was out within ten minutes. The waitress was really great. She was very attentive.Our starters were the kangaroo sliders. And a side order of garlic bread. Sliders were very good. We ordered rare and they were rare. After the sliders, the rest of our dinner was okay to not good.. I ordered the fish and chips. It included a little salad. The dish was good. The fish was nicely  fried. But the plate that was used was too small so fries were constantly falling onto the table. My companion ordered the lamb. He got a much larger plate, weird, since his portion was smaller. Lamb was very tough and flavorless. We decided to pass on dessert.All in all our experience was okay. I now realize It might have been a better experience for my partner and I if we approached Boomerang as a pub and not a restaurant. So on our next visit (via cab) maybe do a Tuesday trivia, stick with the bar menu, and let loose! Hopefully darting children will be safely tucked into bed as I stumble home."

They didn't have salmon and poached eggs in their menu but I requested that the eggs benedict be replaced with a salmon and they accommodated it just fine, no need to pay extra, etc. Just for kicks, we also ordered the huevos rancheros - that's what mexicans have for brunch and its made of scrambled eggs, refried beans, salsa, avocado and crispy tortillas. The avocados needed abit of salt but otherwise I really enjoyed this dish! Just dump everything on the crispy tortilla and enjoy the mini mexican party in your mouth. The poached eggs and salmon were scrumptious and satisfying. The pancakes were generous but we've had better.

I also added two more cups of a la carte coffee for my parents.I was glad to only order one value set to share between three people. It was just the right amount for a perfect afternoon snack. The kaya toast was absolutely delicious; super aromatic, buttery, and sweet. Super addictive and definitely not health conscious. Kopi was a little sweet with some condensed or evaporated milk but it was strong enough to help tone down the sweetness of the toast. Soft boiled eggs were pretty bland so there's white pepper and light soy sauce on the side. Overall, I was really glad to have tried Ya Kun Cafe and some of the most well-known Singaporean staples.

I've visited a couple times, once by myself and once with my partner. The first time I visited, we ordered a large sweet and sour pork, the thai style chicken, and sweet potato with plum powder. The sweet and sour pork was about average and tasty enough- it was a little over fried and the sauce was good but nothing new or exciting. The large portion is good for sharing or for one person who is particularly hungry. My partner ate mostly the thai style chicken and in my opinion, it was tastier and better value than the sweet and sour pork. I ordered the sweet potatoes out of curiosity and by the time it came out (it came out after our entrees) both of us were pretty full. It tasted like extra-sweet and tangy sweet potato fries. A good starter if you enjoy sweet potatoes. I've also had one of their chicken rice sets and it was delightful. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the rice was absolutely delicious but not too oily. I'm not overly familiar with chicken rice so I can't say how it stacks up to other places in the city, though. I ordered an iced coffee to go with it and it was a little on the small side, but up to snuff with other local kopi places. It was a substantial and very thrifty lunch. Service was meager but polite and quite unobtrusive. The interior of the restaurant is very cozy and retro- great for a quick meal alone or with friends!

Every outlet is different and has its own signature ramen dish. The new 40-seater restaurant specialises in Mr. Keisuke Takeda's new creation, Crab Broth Ramen. In Ramen Keisuke Kani King, instead of using pork base which is commonly used, Mr Takeda uses specially imported swimming crabs and chicken bones to create the creamy base for Crab Broth Ramen with Rich Soup whereas for Crab Broth Ramen with Clear Soup, it will be a mixture of crabs, special blended herbs and vegetables and subsequently simmered down for hours to retain the distinct seafood flavour in the soup base.The restaurant was decorated in a colorful and bright way.On the table, besides the menu, there was an order list and a bowl of sesame seeds to ground. One could select the strength of the soup base, the texture of the noodle and optional items in the ramen dish.One used the grounded sesame seeds to add flavour to the ramen dish.It was thoughtful of the restaurant to provide baskets to put the bags in.There is various condiments such as vinegar, table salt, soyu, chilli oil and mayonnaise on the table to help yourself to.Remember to help yourself to the free flow of marinated bean sprouts and Niru cabbage garlic which were avaiable on the table. The cabbage was bland but crunchy in texture.Don't forget to help yourself to the flow free of hard boiled eggs too.KANI TAMA Ramen ($13.90++)Crab Broth with Mixed Fried OmeletThe omelette was filled with crabstick, sliced mushroom and spring onions. The soup base was rich and creamy with full of crab flavours, although it was a bit too salty towards the bottom. I did not miss the cha siew or the flavoured egg which were commonly found in ramen dishes.Overall the food was good and very filling, with so much free flow side dishes to fill up oneself. Service was fast and smooth. By the way there was also free wifi available at this outlet."

I love his rich broth ramen that's really really good to me but for some people it could be quite overwhelming. However, Keisuke Kani King  offers a totally new concept of ramen (apart from the other new and unique keisuke lobster king at Clarke Quay) which is very refreshing as the tonkotsu ramen trend is slowly dying and that's what makes it different from other tonkotsu-based ramen restaurants. This place is such a haven for seafood lovers like me, crabs in particular! But! Don't expect a whole crab on your ramen because the only main thing that's really really crabby is the broth. I am a souphead and obviously I went crazy with the super rich and tantalizing crab broth! We ordered two types of ramen (there are 4 styles):Crab broth ramen with rich soup ($15.9)So creamy and delicious as expected! It's like a mixture of pork, crab and chicken base altogether.Spicy crab broth ramen ($14.9)The rich soup one is delicious but this is the BOMB! I usually avoid spicy/hot food but THIS has got to be the only one that I'd eat! Just looking at the soup color is enough to make you salivate real bad! It's soooo rich, tasty, and the hotness is just right.

One might question the logic of combining Indian and Lebanese food: The chef is Indian, but lived in the Middle East for 20+ years. He must be overworked, for the food takes a long time to come out, and also in random fashion: bread was served a full 10 minutes after the hummus; our two neighbours both had steak frites, but one order came out 5 minutes after the other. An order of pappadum never showed up. When the food does appear though, it does taste good and authentic - delicious pita bread, scrumptious hummus, well-marinated kebab and lamb chops. The Indian dishes served at another table look appetising. Polite albeit not terribly pro-active wait staff."

Good luck avoiding the breads and pasteries...they look delicious! So far, I've had the beetroot, pumpkin and feta salad (skip the feta for the Paleo folks), and it was awesome. Very fresh. I've also sampled their omelet with peppers, mushrooms and ham, which was also good. My favorite so far is their peri peri chicken ($22) because it couldn't be more Paleo with seasoned, grilled chicken breasts and veggies. Don't love too much spice?

Until yesterday, when i happened to walk down this way after coming back from town. Anyway, i came here for lunch so i didn't try the pastries (next time!).I had their roasted chicken sandwich, which was more like a baguette since that's what they used instead of soft bread. This was simple and really good! I don't normally finish the bread part of sandwiches in my feeble attempt to save some carbs, but i definitely gobbled up every last crumbs of this sandwich. The baguette is actually what makes it delicious, it's laced with different types of nuts and seeds which gives it that nice crunchy texture and savory flavor. I do feel the price is steep for just a simple baguette though. It was $11.80, I think i would have been more ok if it was $8-9.I got a long black and, like other reviewers, was disappointed. I expected such place to serve quality coffee, but it tasted like the coffee brewed in my office pantry and costed $4.80.

I swept sweet bakes like Vanilla & Raisin Swirl $3.50 & Orange Brioche off the shelve, and the former wins slightly but with low marks. The Danish presented in burnt rims, has a notable buttery flavor but not rich enough to remember. The sweet glaze blend gently with the flaky pastry partnering some scattered candies raisins. I wasn't really impressed with the taste, just mediocre.The Orange Brioche $5.00, was weaker in taste. It didn't sing any buttery tune like other artisanal brioche, no signs of flakiness and rather dry in its texture. There was a small helping of citrus scented custard piped in the middle of the dough, mildly sweet. The orange fruit slice hindered my chewing - simply aesthetically pleasing on the the sweet bread.The Madeleine $2.00/pc, was a decent piece. Not exceedingly sweet with a soft interior. I'd prefer it to be served warm like db Moderne Bistro so that I could taste the rich buttery structure in its comforting warmth. This one was left in the open, atop the pastry glass cabinet, side-by-side the Financiers. Obviously, it has been overpriced.The Kumara & Bleu Tart $6.00/pc, champ the fleet in my whole selection when its rivals failed to compete well. The soft and crumbly tart shell adapted quite well to the sweet orange-pigmented kumara cubes gelled together in a pool of coagulated cheese - buttery rich and very delightful. Noticeable flavor is seen coming from the flaky tart, less from the filling.The battle field continues to be less interesting when the limping Roast Chicken Sandwich $11.50, hit the ground. The fillet slices were dry and fibrous, no traces of flavor until my taste buds met up with the sweet onion chutney above the fresh lettuce. The hard-like-rock baguette made things worst, it was a total shame!When I thought nothing will be praised, I was charmed by the healthier fare, $8.50 - Quinoa & Lentil Salads. The power grains are executed in perfection along with a mixture of soft lentil which is often undercooked. Carefully seasoned with the right amount of tang lending from the balsamic reduction and some sweet hints from the fresh apple slices, the rehydrated dried cranberry fruits, the heap of rocket greens woke my taste buds with a striking saltiness from the accompanying shaven Parmesan. Just as the episode starts to climax, I felt a cold gush of water came splashing down - the 2 sesame rolls that served alongside was rockier & rubbery than the earlier baguette! What's happening to the breads here? I let out a heavy sigh!"

Have to say they're very generous with the beef and the chunks were tender, not chewy. Good quality balsamic on the accompanying salad.  The portobello sandwich had generous stuffing of well seasoned portobello, but it was cold. Would be much better warm. The chocolate croissant wasn't buttery enough although it was ok. Chocolate eclair wasn't too sweet but again ok, no great shakes. Best thing was a lemon curd tart with a bracingly tangy curd - but then again I can make lemon curd, so um not blown away. Long black coffee tasted a little sour like it'd been percolating a while so I'd advise coffee aficionados to go for the lattes and mochas which have to be made fresh."

Check. Taste? Double-check. Served in a nice porcelain (not sure about that) dish were big chicken chunks and al dente (aha!) pasta with a lovely cream sauce... but they left the peas out. Hmm.That aside, the hazelnut gelato ($4) was to die for. Probably not made with Nutella (the easy way out for most ice creameries), each scoop was chock-full with nutty goodness, and there were about 8 whole hazelnuts - wow!Definitely worth a return trip if I'm back in the area and need some dessert. They also had a rather impressive breakfast menu ($7 for Eggs Benedict)! But they stop serving at 11.30 am. Might give that a shot as well."

Did I mention reading? As the cafe's name eludes to, there is a very large inventory of reading material for one's perusal. Free and fast WiFi (perhaps I visited when patrons weren't streaming). Order cheese cake slices and a flat white. Cheese cakes had a gummy texture to the surface layer, so maybe it wasn't as fresh as I expected. The flat white was very good.

But that's probably about to change as some people come here for dinner, dessert, or drinks. This is the kind of cafe to come, relax and chill for awhile.  Half of the cafe space is simply an enclave of comfy sofas and shelves of magazines and books.  This is the kind of place you expect to spend at least an hour or two, or three...The prices are mid-range but that is to be expected, given the location.  It's walking distance from Robertson Quay, with its fancy restaurants and bars.  The Book Cafe offers a nice ambience for personal time; and even if you come with someone, you are able to each do your own thing while sitting comfortably side-by-side.

I was able to try this cafe after seeing it a multitude of times, and the cozy exterior indeed is reflected inside. The cafe offers different types of cafe food like sandwiches, all-day breakfast options, and pasta/asian foods after 11am. I ordered the Emmentaler omelet, which came with eggs, lean bacon, tomatoes, avocado and sour cream, and toast. I got the whole grain toast, and it was a very generous serving with butter and jam. The omelet was very thick and the stronger taste of the cheese accompanied the bacon very nicely. It was a good portion for brunch. The prices were typical of the area, my omelet was $20 SGD and most of the brunch dishes were similarly priced. The desserts and drinks looked really good as well, and I hope to come back to try their pasta. Most of all, the ambience is what makes it really worth coming here, and many people come here to study/read creating a fusion of restaurant/coffeeshop vibes.

All I can say is that it's reputation certainly lives up to its name with large bookshelves inside covered in books, as well as a number of covers of Lolita on one of the walls. I came here for breakfast (I simply wasn't interested in breakfast at my hotel, even though it was probably included in the price) and I must admit that it was pretty good, and the coffee wasn't all that bad either. This is one of those places that I could easily spend a few hours in every morning with a hot cup of tea and a nice book.

On a few occasions I spent about 4 continuous hours here working and studying. The staff is wonderful. I am always greeted with a friendly smile. The lemon pine nut pie (available only on fridays and weekends) is to die for. The flavors compliment each other so well and the presentation is beautiful. The eggs Royale and eggs Blackstone are also solid dishes to try here. The dragonfruit and pear juice is my personal favorite drink here. The iced Carmel latte also delicious on a hot day (which is literally every day in Singapore). Very unpretentious. I definitely recommend this spot.

I stayed for a couple hours on Sunday to work, and they were very accommodating. PRICE: Very reasonable all things considered. You can get a proper breakfast/meal + coffee for right around $20.

Have tried the pancakes and the fry up which consisted of hash brown, sausages, bacon, toast and eggs for brunch, cod and sandwiches for dinner, and last but not least, hot cocoa with marshmallows, mango smoothies and a variety of desserts i.e, apple pie, lemon and rosemary cake with Greek yogurt as well as pine nut pie (available only on weekends).

Even full-on franchise Italian-American restaurants boast about their ""authentic Italian origin"". Unfortunately, on my experience, the more they declare their authenticity, the more tasteless the food turns out to be. The more they boast about their ""ricetta de la nonna"" (grandma's recipe, the cliché of clichés), the more pedestrian the recipe is.D.O.P. Mozzarella Bar is all about claiming authenticity, starting with the name. The menu itself has an introduction stating the owner's true Italian origin and how we would find ""traditional"", ""authentic"", and ""pure"" Italian food. When we got there (several weeks ago, I'm such a slacker with my reviews) the maitre d' immediately told us they were having some trouble with their oven so our dishes would take longer than usual to be ready. We stayed nonetheless (wine makes time fly).Our dishes came out quite promptly, in fact. We went the easy way and had risotto and ravioli. The food was really flavourful, well cooked and carefully crafted. The environment is modern and elegant, but welcoming. It has no squarely-patterned tablecloths, faded pictures of smiling people on Sicilian villages or most of the visual stereotypes Italian restaurants commonly abuse, which is highly appreciated. They even ditch the ricetta de la nonna, but substitute it for ""Mama Teresa's recipe"". Prices are in line with most of the Robertson Quay area (pricey, that is), but the food is truly appetising. The key, as usual, is to focus on the food and go easy on the wine. They sell high-quality cheeses and carefully selected Italian ingredients, that is a plus.D.O.P. Mozzarella doesn't need to claim and assert its Italian purity on every paragraph. The food is delightful, and that makes any appeal to tradition or righteousness irrelevant. I have no doubt the place will be a success."

Was really expecting more flavor. My tacos were then brought to me and there was not a shred of cheese on them. But the instead put red cabbage. Well I tried the beef. It was a bland, watery mess. I was so disappointed. So then I asked again for my drink. It was brought out and to my surprise was just a nasty looking lemon slice on a glass of margarita on the rocks. Tasted it and was again disappointed. Well moved to the chicken taco, and Wow, disappointment number 4!!! Tastes like eating a paper taco with cabbage. No cilantro in sight. No spices, or hot sauces to add. Just a lot of money and a disappointed stomach. Asked for my check and left after paying S$10 for on beef taco and S$8 for the chicken.

My favorite dish by far was the blue crab tostaditas! Price point is definitely on the higher end, probably because of the location as well. With that said, I think a lot of people on yelp are complaining because they're not used to paying for a single taco (I've been to a few restaurants that charge by per taco overseas).

The poblano taco needing a lot of help in the seasoning department. The lamb al pastor and the lengua tacos were not bad.

I admire her taste in furniture and her keen eye for decor. Her taste in music is top notch, as she bobs her head to club-like Tanjong Beach Club-esque tunes. And my, can she cook up a storm. For starters, her salsa is pretty good but her guac isn't as good as mine. (And I'm not saying that 'cause I'm jealous. I make a meaaaaan guac!) Her elotes (which is roasted corn smothered in sauce and sprinkled with cheese and chives) are probably one of the best snacks I've had in a while. I also loved one of her tuna appetizers, though I forgot what it's called. Although I'm an only child, I do understand that people hate it when you compare them to their sibling.

Looked at the menu and ordered two beef and two Chicken.Plus ordered a side of chips and guacamole dip.Well normal Mexican food restaurants don't usually charge separate for a small helping of chips, and charge for salsa. But this place does. Since the salsa and Guacamole were the same price I went for the Guacamole $5 Singapore dollars and $5 Singapore dollars for the small bowl of chips.I also ordered a margarita.Well I got the bland chips and the blandest guacamole ever. Was really expecting more flavor. My tacos were then brought to me and there was not a shred of cheese on them. But the instead put red cabbage. Well I tried the beef. It was a bland, watery mess. I was so disappointed. So then I asked again for my drink. It was brought out and to my surprise was just a nasty looking lemon slice on a glass of margarita on the rocks. Tasted it and was again disappointed. Well moved to the chicken taco, and Wow, disappointment number 4!!! Tastes like eating a paper taco with cabbage. No cilantro in sight. No spices, or hot sauces to add. Just a lot of money and a disappointed stomach. Asked for my check and left after paying S$10 for on beef taco and S$8 for the chicken. S$16 for the margarita, and S$10 for the chips and guacamole.The Resturant at least took off the two tacos I didn't eat. I highly discourage anyone eating here, unless you like high priced bland food..."

My favorite dish by far was the blue crab tostaditas! Price point is definitely on the higher end, probably because of the location as well. With that said, I think a lot of people on yelp are complaining because they're not used to paying for a single taco (I've been to a few restaurants that charge by per taco overseas). The only disappointing thing, for me, was dessert. Their churros were a little bit overdone, and my husband didn't really like the rice icecream."

Even at 6:30pm the place was already packed.Overall I think their food was tasty. i enjoyed my meal, and this place has got their ambience correct for that trendy place with dim dim light (the older couple next to our table made me smile when they used their iphone light to look at the menu) but what ultimately made me knock off one star is the price to portion ratio. It baffles me that $11-13 per taco is just for ONE single 6"" taco. The flautas were $18 for two regular sized rolls, and the quesadilla was also $18 for tiny pieces. Churros were $12 for 5 pieces. The elotes was as tasty as everyone gushed, but it's $8 for half a cob of corn.I think if the prices were 20% less, it would have made more sense. But then again, in a country where $22-28 cocktail has become a norm, i guess this is the price to pay for glam-ed up street food?The drinks on the other hand, is pretty averagely priced at $15-18.

My general rule is: if a restaurant has neon signs, cacti, sombreros, skulls, and a stereotypical name including words such as ""tequila"", ""amigo"", ""fiesta"", ""loco"", ""señor"" or ""latino"", that is definitely a place to avoid. So, anyone could understand why I was reluctant to visit a place called ""Super Loco"".Reading the menu quickly dispelled my fears: no burritos, no nachos, no chimichangas, no fajitas, no chilli con carne, no ""taco meat"" (whatever that is). Instead, they have proper corn flour tortillas and also several welcome surprises with ingredients such as axiote, huitlacoche and pibil pulled pork. There is fairly good variety of tequila and mezcal, some very good brands included, and even explain the difference between tequila and mezcal. When it came to taste, Super Loco delivered. I had a huitlacoche quesadilla, with more mushrooms than huitlacoche but was still good. I also tried a red snapper taco which had a very nice touch of axiote, and a very nice mango ceviche. I was glad to have some of those nearly tasteless but fresh Mexican beers we like so much, rather overpriced. The only thing I did not like was the habanero sauce since it was, in fact, mayonnaise and that ruined the habanero taste. Overall, it was a good meal. It was also overpriced, though.The obvious question is if the place is ""truly"" Mexican, whatever that means. I could tell the owners are not Mexican, some slight misspellings on the menu gave them away. However, it is clear they have done their homework properly. The menu states they travelled to Mexico City and the Pacific Coast to do research on street food, and that explains Super Loco's good taste. It is a very good take on Mexican street food. It's true, maybe it's not exactly as it is in México (purists sure will say that), but it has the proper essence. The fact that they don't stick lime wedges on your beer makes them more Mexican than many other joints I've visited elsewhere."

I'm a big fan of Mexican food. Super Loco delivers HOWEVER beware, prices are steep. A single taco could equal a meal elsewhere. A single Elote is enough to burn pockets. So order with caution! Prices aside, food was incredible. Flavours were spot on and service was great. Ambience was fun and vibrant. I'm a big fan of ceviche and man do I love their combinations. Their tortilla chips are super addictive and the hot sauces are so flavourful you hardly notice the spice. Elote was simply awesome and tacos were delicious. However the portions leave a lot to be desired. Remember to leave space for cocktails as they have a pretty extensive list. I understand that Super Loco is situated in an expat area and prices are suited to the clients there but I feel that for the amount of food they serve, the prices are unreasonable. Not for every dish but for most. I'd love to return as much as I can but the prices are simply far too high. Amazing food. High prices. Worth a try for a true Mexican food lover."

This was a decent portion that two of us shared.Tortillas good (portions of two) but small so you need another couple to fill the gap.

We sampled several different tacos and they were all good but everything does however feel slightly like a rip off as prices are too high for what they are serving.I was also (like some other reviewers) asking for some changes to the dish but that was not possible which also seems to suggest they are perhaps not making the food (or that they are just unwilling to do much for their customers). Service was very disinterested as well, one of these places where the staff are more interested in talking to each other, checking their phones or fixing nails and/or make-up.

The sweetcorn fritters were nice and crispy with a little sweetness and paired well with the salty smoked salmon. My little one LOVED her berry smoothie and I felt pretty great letting her go wild with the smoothie because it was full of almond milk, coconut water, and agave nectar.  It's great when restaurants present sugar-free, healthy options.  But when you want the sugar, look no further than the crispy, sweet churros.  Fried dough and chocolate sauce - does it get better than this?The verdict?I'd definitely return.  The ambiance is chill and it's a nice, family friendly option.  This is more of a Californian Mexican style type of restaurant, but in a good way.  I'm just thinking of my next smoothie there..."

The tacos are served on single tortillas with a small portion of al pastor, couple pieces of grilled pinapple, and salsa Verde. Each taco is a couple bites. The only issue with the dish was the overcooked meat, which tells me they don't prepare the al pastor on a revolving spicket as its traditionally done. It had ok flavor, but was dry and tough. Quesadilla was average at best, and lacked cheese. No stringy, oozey, goodness here. Food is better here than at their sister restaurant, Lucha Loco.AMBIANCE: Decoration is well done. Comfortable, relatable, but elevated enough to host a date or set group dinner. It has the markings of a Baja taqueria without actually putting you there. I only wish it were a bit brighter. I sat inside, and found it hard to see what I was eating. Probably not an issue if seated outside. PRICE: It's expensive for dinner, because the portions are so small. My bill for one totaled $37.50 and I could've eaten a couple more tacos ($11-$16 each). OVERALL: Come for drinks + late night eats. It's not a bad place to visit, and could be very fun.

The menu is very close to the one at Lucha Loco, and so are the exorbitant prices. For the premium pricing, I was underwhelmed by the food. I went for the elotes (mexican grilled corn), a couple of tacos, a chile relleno and the huitlacoche quesadilla. The chile relleno tasted rather tired and bland. The huitlacoche quesadilla didn't contain any huitlacoche, they substituted with a couple of mushrooms and corn. Maybe Singaporeans aren't ready for the real thing. (Huitlacoche, plainly speaking, is mouldy fungus infected corn, i.e. an acquired taste) Their tacos were a little better, but not particularly authentic. Also, $8 for half a ear of corn?! You have gotta be kidding me. Again, it's Mexican street food! Tacos cost between US$2-4, S$8-12 is daylight robbery at around 4-5 times the cost. I've eaten at many a food truck and hole-in-the-wall type places south of the border, I know what I'm talking about.Adios, better Mexican food and pricing can be found elsewhere in Singapore."

So perhaps adjusting expectations before going helps the experience. We went during happy hour for $9 frozen margaritas and these were strong enough. I prefer margaritas on the rocks but not available for happy hour. Advised that the dishes were meant for sharing family style so for 8 of us we got 4 dishes and chips and salsa. In America each dish woulda been a portion for one but that is bc we are fat Americans. It was plenty of food and it actually tasted really good. Had the chicken enchiladas and the steak both of which were flavorful. The salsa that came with the chips isn't really my favorite kind - more smoky rather than fresh but went nicely with the drinks. The setting is fun and it didn't rain and their fans are powerful enough to feel like a cooling night breeze. Overall attentive service and a fun night to hang with other friends who had to leave for the airport early. I certainly wouldn't have chosen to go here just bc the name but my friends did and I'm glad we did. I think the dishes were expensive - like high 20s to low 30s but I'm getting used to these types of prices. I suppose it's about the same for tourists that end up hanging around Times Square. I mean what else do u expect but jacked up prices and mediocre food? So when I get pretty decent food like I did here I'll just be happy and not sweat the high prices.

I especially disliked how the ""tequila cart"" came round and the servers ""didn't know how much each shot costs"" yet pressured my whole table into buying them. It sounds silly but you'll understand when you're there. It was $16 each, which is Pangaea type pricing while drinking said shot next to a kid watching Aladdin on his iPad.

Therefore when I heard a new Mexican place was opened in town, I was excited to try it out. My experience at Super Loco was a big disappointment. While the place is nice and trendy, the food is really what I cared about. The moment we sat down, my friend and I proceeded to order some drinks and chips and guac. She ordered a horchata and it just tasted someone dumped a whole bunch of cinnamon powder into the glass. My friend sent it back (after explaining how to make it) and they ended up adding a bunch of milk and when we commented it was not right- the waitress came back and told us the bartender said he didn't know how to make it and will make another drink instead. Really?? The chips and guac came- the chips were stale and the guac was a liquid mess. We ordered enchiladas and it came out soggy and was tasteless. None of the taste blended in together and nothing was flavorful. We also ordered a taco but even now as I'm writing this review, I cant even remember what kind of taco we ordered. The entire meal was unsatisfying and unmemorable. To top of it off, when we got the bill they decided to charge us 3x for the drinks. While we were arguing the bill (and managed to get them to change it) we noticed other tables complaining to the staff as well, especially one guy who was complaining loudly to the manager about the service."

The atmosphere here is usually tranquil and peaceful (cept when a few party goers drop by in the evenings). I particularly love the hanging chairs although they might not be as comfortable to lounge in as the sofas around. Food wise, they do sell main meals although there is nothing much to shout. The drinks are reliably good and there are a few innovative tastes you can choose from. For me, I always stick to hazelnut latte. For those who are avoiding caffeine, there is also a range of sodas, blends, yoghurt drinks and milk shakes to choose from."

While I think the food and drinks are just about average with some rather inventive but odd-tasting drinks like Lychee Jazz, I am rather fond of the decor and comfort at this particular TCC outlet. Located at Robertson Quay with many plush and expensive restaurants around, this bright but warmly lit cafe stands out in the day as an ideal environment for tea. The chairs are comfortable and large enough to sink into. We spent numerous lazy hours there with a few snacks and drinks until it was almost sunset. There were few people going in and out, and most were large groups of friends or families. It was quiet enough for talking to friends but also had just enough people so that it doesn't feel empty. Granted, I did not enjoy my drink but the light snacks like spicy wings, mozza stick or shrooms bite were good accompaniments along with their selection of desserts. There is also usually a tea set with small savoury and sweet snacks that makes choosing a lot easier."

The waiting staff came to take our order shortly after we were seated but never asked us if we wanted water or tea (not sure if it's because we ordered a bottle of sake.) We had a toddler but they also never asked if we needed kid utensils or bowls. When the server brought us our meat, she also didn't explain which body part or type of meat it was. The food itself was good and the environment was nice. But the service was definitely not what you would expect for a Japanese joint."

A little further down from where I usually stray, this joint is located closer to the Tyler Print Institute than the main Robertson hive. First up, a friend tried to get us a table without reservation but was turned away. Full, they said, despite there being several empty tables. A second friend wouldn't take no for an answer and sat at one nonchalantly. And that's how our party of five got in. Score!It's a BBQ joint so you get to choose from the set or a la carte menus, and grill your meats over a mass of charcoal. We opted for Set E, that at $75, seemed only sufficient for two. Rice, tamago soup, kimchi, tiger prawns, chicken, beef, beef and potato stew, and a side of salad. We added on two more plates of wagyu beef, one sliced and one in cubes just for good measure. The stars of the show was undoubtedly the wagyu slices and the beef and spud stew. Well marbled cuts of meat, these babies were delicious and flavorful. They barely needed a minute on each side on the grill and were wonderfully tender. You're able to savor the meat with a drizzle of lemon, a dash of salt, or simply au natural. The stew, too was great. With gravy a little on the thinnish side, the cuts of meat were fork tender and went very well with the rice provided. Everything else was rather plebeian, and with it's obvious popularity, it was exceedingly difficult to get service. However, to their credit, the staff were unfailingly polite and provided extra lemons, plates, and water with no hesitation."

The BBQ was fantastic. It had a pretty cosy feel about it, as there were about 10-15 indoor tables and the place was packed! We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait at least, which is quite surprising for a weekday evening, but that's how good the food was. The menu was pretty extensive, I remember loving the beef short ribs the best, as they were so yummy and tasty when grilled on the BBQ. You get to cook your own food, which is part of the experience, and we tried a variety of other meats but nothing came even close to the beef short ribs (we didn't try the wagyu beef as it was pricey). Dinner was a little pricey, but all said, completely enjoyable. Service was pretty excellent for a busy night, and it was a lot of fun taking the time to cook our own meats and relaxing over a beer while looking out the window and people watching as the restaurant is located near a small river canal. The lights in the area get pretty nice too at night, as it's beside a residential condominium, which adds to the vibe of a nice, upscale restaurant in a local neighborhood. I would love to go back again!"

After looking at my options, I figured I'd check Ichinoji out since Man Man and U-ya are incredibly popular and may have long lines at lunch.Ichinoji is in a little alleyway in Robertson Quay and when you turn the corner, you can already smell that great charcoal they use on the unagi. While there are no sets specific to lunch available, there is an unagi fair happening right now and we ordered one Unagi Omelette, one Unajyu and one Large Hitsumabushi (from the regular menu).Unagi Omelette - like a dashimaki with unagi in the middle. The dashimaki was delicious, not too firm, had a lot of flavor from the dashi and encased some delicious unagi!Unajyu - very generous portion, about 2 full pieces of unagi on top of rice, accompanied by chawanmushi, grilled unagi bones, soup, pickles, and dessert (warabi mochi & kanten). Everything was delicious. The unagi was nice and soft, while still having a great smoky flavor from the grill. The chawanmushi was nicely done and I also liked the dessert which wasn't too heavy.Hitsumabushi - I ordered the large because the medium one looked tiny, and that was the right amount for me. It's always fun eating hitsumabushi since you get to enjoy it in multiple ways. The set came with the usual bucket of rice topped with unagi which was grilled to perfection, condiments (leeks, fresh wasabi, seaweed) and dashi to make ochazuke.I took one star off for the location because while it's great, I don't see myself going out of the way just to go there. Service was passable but nothing to write home about. Otherwise, this place was reasonably priced for the portions, wasn't too crowded which was perfect, and was a nice place for a quiet lunch!"

They have an extensive list of house pours, none of which break the bank. My favourite type of wine is a nice, robust Red Zinfandel. I have found that Red Zins are difficult to find in Asia. Typically if you do find one it is only by the bottle and ridiculously expensive. Wind Connection offers a glass of 7 Deadly Zins at $11 SGD a glass!

This review is probably one of those that people will read as ""well it's an outlier, you always get those when you own a restaurant"". Well my response would be that a restaurant is only tested through their handing of issues, and their interaction with their customers, not when someone rates 5 starts for ordering a glass of wine, which requires no thought, I don't feel this is representational of the restaurants ability to serve, and thus earn their 5 star rating. Let me explain what happened and you can judge for yourself.Typical night out to dinner and drinks, a few bottles of cheap wine and some apps and mains. My wife orders spaghetti, and it was too spicy for her taste. Easy enough, right? We asked the waiter if we could order something else, we told him that the dish was too spicy, he said ok and we ordered something else. Like any normal restaurant, with any normal level of service, you would expect the spaghetti removed from the bill, replaced with the new item, right? Wrong.I thought they forgot, so I reminded them. This is where their true colors came out. ""Sir, as stated on the menu, we only allow a switch if there is exactly one bite, but your wife had more then one bit."" Well I guess I can't say that I am surprised as in Singapore if there is a rule, there is no exception. After explaining that the spaghetti probably cost them under $1, and that any normal restaurant would remove the $12 item from a $300 bill, they insisted that a $300 bill is their normal check value and my wife ""ordered incorrectly"" as it states spicy on the menu. So after refusing to remove the item, spending 5 minutes explaining their one bite policy, and accusing my wife of ordering incorrectly, I admittedly lost it.  I could not comprehend what was going on, it turned into a scene and ruined our night. I'll add that finally they removed the item, as I think they knew by that time I was not going to back down.You, as a restaurant, are not selling me $12 spaghetti, you are selling me the experience of a nice night out, you are selling me your customer experience and in turn I am spending my night, filling your seat. Well here is the ultimate lesson for you, if, by me writing this review, it is preventing at least 1 person from spending $12 at your restaurant, then your one bite policy, and your disrespect for the customer has lost you money, and I have succeeded."

I was most impressed by the appetisers (hummus, leaf-wrapped finger foods). They were done with finesse and presented impeccably. I wasn't too enthused about the kebab mains that I had: it was not particularly memorable, although the portion was generous and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. A decent entree.The meatball with spaghetti can be an utter mess once you get into it, although the flavour of the meat cannot be faulted. The spaghetti was so-so, with the tomato sauce needing a little more seasoning. I would recommend you come for the appetiser platters: try as many as you can, and bring a lot of friends along! The prices are reasonable for such nice ambience and food."

The flavour was extremely delicate.Mekajiki (Swordfish) Sashimi tinyurl.com/cehd94oMaguro (Tuna) & Avocadotinyurl.com/cwleltsMixed Plate (we selected) - Ebi (Shrimp), Saba (Mackerel), Uni (Sea Urchin), Blue Fin (for her - I choose not to eat Blue Fin tuna)tinyurl.com/d7cl9t2Wafu Sakoro Beef - I really enjoyed this dish.  I can think of no better way to describe than a Japanese version of country friend steak with mashed potatoes.  There were nuggets of breaded steak placed on top of mashed potatoes.  The seasoning was amazing.  The meat was tender with the slight crunch of the breading.  I could eat this everyday.tinyurl.com/d2y6e6jTempura Mori - This was a mixed tempura.  It was actually very good.  I also enjoyed the sauce provided for this.  When served, the tempura was hot and crisp.  I particularly enjoyed the mushrooms.Unfortunately, it was served during the full flurry of dishes. It was pushed to a far corner of the table making it difficult for either of us to try it.  We did manage to work around and eat most of it.  But, with everything else, by the time we ate it, much of the tempura had cooled.tinyurl.com/cwaostmShabu Shabu - First, since this was brought overlapping everything else, it was very difficult to manage the cooking process.  It was quite good but because of timing we kept slightly overcooking the meat.  Their version of the standard shabu shabu dip was divine.tinyurl.com/cujb3tltinyurl.com/d94sgg7Salmon Kama (jawbone) - They were out of the hamachi kama.  We decided on the salmon.  This was my first time having salmon kama.  I must admit this was probably the one dish too far.  We had ordered a lot of food.  I did try it and it was extremely good.  The fish was so tender and flaky.  We did not come close to finishing this dish.tinyurl.com/cl2x95cAlong the way, I pretty much lost my bottle of sake.  While keeping up with all of the food, I just didn't have time to keep pouring.  I think I drank less than half of it.Receipt ($272.20)tinyurl.com/d6qhplhDuring this review, I have commented numerous times on the timing of the meal.  However, it was egregious.  This should have been an enjoyable relaxed dining experience where we could truly savor their very delicious food.  However, it was not.  It was a race to try the dishes and complete them while they were still at their peak.Overall - The food was very good.  With the exception of the pacing and some lapses in attentiveness, the service was good.  The room is quite comfortable with a warm and inviting feel and impressive modern design elements.  This could have been a four or five star experience.  In the end though, it fell short."

But little did i know i've been missing out on the biggest in-plain-sight gem, Z'en Japanese Cuisine, for so long. I've walked past (and even through) this restaurant at UE Square too many times and i can't believe i never considered going in. Z'en (a sister outlet of En Japanese Dining Bar) is run by executive chef, Masashi Yasui from Kyoto. You'll be dizzy with choices just looking at the a la carte buffet menu (64 items in total) and there are a lot more in the main one. I would highly recommend the buffet for the quality items and reasonable price. Buffet prices are listed at the end of the post and it's cheaper to go on weekends (i don't know why but i'm not complaining). I was looking forward to lots of Shabu shabu after a recent authentic meal. Z'en serves both the beef and chicken shabu shabu. Needless to say, we went for the Australian Wagyu beef (200g for $39). The meat isn't sliced very thin and that took a while to cook on the portable stove but it was quite delicious with the ponzu sauce. Remember to ask for the peanut one too! We had at least 10 plates of this. Very nice and not too bad marbling.Other than shabu shabu, other items include some sushi and salmon sashimi. The pieces of sashimi are very small (1/4 the regular size). It's easier to order a few more sets at a go. I wasn't expecting very high quality sashimi anyway so it met my expectations. The Aburi salmon sushi was nice too with small amounts of rice and the salmon was nicely torched. We gave the rest of the sushi a miss to save our stomach space. Of course the rice and noodles section was left unordered. If you must, try the Zuwai Chahan with gravy (Crab Fried Rice, mui fan style, S$23).From the Grilled Dishes, you mustn't miss the Sirloin Steak with ponzu sauce (200g for S$32). This was perfectly grilled to a tender pink and when it was served, we simply ignored the shabu shabu. This is THE DISH to eat. The fried garlic at the side were irresistible and went well with the meat. For moo moo lovers, do order the Stir Fried Tenderloin Beef cubes with mashed potatoes as well (we forgot about it)The boys loved the Grilled Squid (S$13) and Baked Oysters as well. Not too rubbery, nicely grilled and rather fresh. There are some skewers and grilled fish on the menu but we gave that a miss.From the fried section, i adored the Cream Crab Croquette (4pcs for S$10), Ebi Tempura (3pcs for S$13) and Age Gyoza (5pcs for S$10). The Agedashi Tofu (S$10) wasn't too bad either as it cleanses the palette with its light broth.Desserts weren't that fantastic but i ate some anyway. You need a sweet end to every meal. Skip the chocolate and vanilla ice cream. The green tea one is a little too milky as well. The Tofu cheesecake and Creme Brulee were adequate in taste and texture. There were many dishes that we didn't try but we were very happy with most of the items which we had. The boys were quite happy with my restaurant choice, even the picky W. I will probably be back when my Shabu craving kicks in again. Service was a little slow and they have the tendency to forget your orders so place more in advance. Wastage is charged though so don't over-order!Now for the buffet prices: Weekday Lunch (S$38++)Weekday and Eve of PH Dinner: S$52++Weekend and PH Dinner: S$48++Make a reservation! It's very popular.

They have an elaborate menu so everyone can have their pick. I got their duck omelet from their brunch menu and it was a generous amount with juicy sides - tomato and mushroom infused with delicious herby sauce. The duck was very well cooked and flavorful. The bread that came with the omelet was the downside of the meal - it was dry and did not serve a purpose at all. In fact, it absorbed a large portion of the moisture from the omelet. I also got to try their French bean in Szechuan sauce - this is like your regular si ji dou - except cooked with lots of flavor. Highly recommended to fulfill your vege of the day! Besides their food, their service was very friendly and food served in a timely manner. I would give this place a visit again, maybe to try their main dishes next time."

My impression was that it is a cool bar that does drinks and the usual bar grub and hence it piqued my curiosity when i was invited to brunch by the nice folks at District 10.When i stepped into the restaurant, i noticed that the decor has changed. The place is now bigger, brighter and certainly classier. We had the District 10 Eggs Benedict ($16). I was a little confused because they turned out to be Eggs Florentine. Anyhow, lovely poached eggs on fluffy toasted muffins with a nice crisp on the outside. I found that the hollandaise sauce was well balanced with the flavors from the sautéed spinach and smoked salmon.We had the interesting Pandan Coconut Pancake with Gula Melaka Syrup ($9) which tasted like the traditional Malay kuehs. The pancakes are on the dense and chewy end with crispy shredded coconut on top (the browned parts). I couldn't stop soaking the pancakes into the brown sugar syrup. Lovely. But only if you like kueh.Next, we moved on to the heavier items. The Hoegarden Battered Fish & Chips with mint mushy peas and tartare sauce ($22). The fish was satisfactory crisp but had its limelight stolen by the amazing natural cut fries. Hell they can be a main on their own. Love the salty batter! The District 10 Brunch Beef Burger ($20) comes paired with the fries too. Hooray! Charcoal-grilled Black Angus patties topped with fried egg, crispy back bacon, cheddar cheese on a sesame bun. You can never go wrong with the egg bacon cheese combination but i thought the patty was a little dry. Well, at least you know they don't use unknown cow bits in this one. Do not miss the thin crust pizzas by Italian Chef Luca Pezzera. Love the crust that crackles with each bite. The Portobello Mushrooms pizza ($26) with Portobello mushrooms and a generous serving of truffle oil on top was earthy and delicious.For something with a local twist, there's the Wagyu Beef Cheek Rendang pizza ($29). The meat was flavorful but somehow it was very gelatinous. The sauce however was pretty spot on for an Italian creating a local favorite. Thumbs up to Chef Luca but could we have more toppings please."

Meanwhile my friend and I had finished our brugers which were good, not excellent.So lesson learned, visit this place in the evening.  Their day time game is not up to snuff."

It was served at the seating area - it functions as a breakfast area from 6:30am to 10:30am, normal cafe from then to the evening - and the bar starts functioning from 6pm to 1am. So, it is quite a good deal actually. I tried the breakfast, which was pretty okay. There's a general spread - cereal, noodles, fruits, salad, meat and cheese platter, soups, omelet station, etc.What I Love: It's got nice decor, and the omelet station was good. Food was nice. I had grilled vegetables and the omelet. The bacon was pretty yummy too (I kinda helped myself to quite a few servings of that). The coffee station was good - you could make your own - which I don't mind - as then, I can make it my own way. The vegetables were fresh - there were quite a few options and at least there were healthy options.What I Don't Love: The noodles looked like they were dipped and coated in oil. Ewwww. I shrugged it off. The Cafe is also pretty tiny. When you have quite a full hotel - you gotta have enough seats. So, I took my breakfast to the poolside to get privacy. There could be more options."

Heard a lot about this place from my co-workers, and they usually recommend pretty good places to eat.With pizza selections like ""The Hangover"", ""Truffle Shuffle"", and ""Hipster"", you know you're in for something a little different. Trying to make myself feel like I was being a little healthier I started with the Baby Spinach Salad, which was really good. A great vinaigrette with very fresh tasting ingredients. This was probably large enough to be a meal in itself, but being the glutton and truffle head that I am, I decided to also order the Truffle Shuffle.The pizza is a thin crust and about the size of a medium domino's pizza. The Truffle Shuffle's roasted mushrooms, onions, and truffle oil were the stars of the pizza. If it wasn't for the salad, I would have easily polished off the whole pizza.Definitely a must try if you are craving some pizza. I will be back again to try the other pizzas!"

Pizza's range between $15-$19. It is much larger location than both the Suntec and Katong branches and is perfect lunch spot for those living in the area and doing some people watching.It is of note that the One-for-One Pizza deal is available to all Alt Pizza locations, but is for a limited time only. I wouldn't be surprised if the promotion has already ended. All in all, a fantastic place to get pizza, if you are willing to spend approx, $20 per person. I would say the food quality/taste of the pizzas at Robertson Quay branch is as good as than one in Suntec and better than the Katong branch. :-)"

The differences are mainly in terms of style, and you see that in décor AND service: (Although it is located in a shopping mall) Cut is more formal, while Wolfgang (located in a '5-star-minus' hotel) is friendlier and more relaxed. Normally, I find the 'standard' piece of beef and two sides the maximum food I can gulp down in a meal. Unlike Cut, Wolfgang is open for lunch, so you have the option of having the same cuts of steak but in smaller sizes, and thus able to enjoy more of the restaurant's offerings; in this regard , the set lunch (comprising 3 appetisers, a salad or soup, a steak, 2 sides, dessert, and coffee/tea) is extremely good value. The accompaniments are good but not exceptional; the steaks are the real thing. Our party ordered and shared the Cajun rib eye, tenderloin and petit filet mignon. They're all very succulent and irreproachably satisfying. The wine list caters to various tastes and purses. So, Both Wolfgangs are to be commended - Mozart at two different stages of life. Unless you want a very high-end dining experience (but then, why steaks?), Wolfgang seems to be the better (and more economic) choice."

The Os A Moelle/Bone Marrow with Toast is the must order Entree ($18) - definitely some of the best bone marrow I've ever had! Make sure you order an extra serve of thin, crisp toast too - the warm and springy rolls from the bread basket just don't do this dish justice! As far as Steaks go, I thoroughly enjoyed the Grilled Rib Eye with Vigneron Butter ($38.80) and Grilled Sirloin with Herbs ($38.80) - it was very classic and kept simple to highlight the steaks, which were both cooked to a perfect medium rare. The house made fries are so crisp and moreish, but ironically enough - we were so full that we gave the endless supply a miss. The only disappointment was the Créme Caramel Maison ($12) which was all booze and no caramel crackle - which, in my opinion, is the best part of a créme caramel! Be prepared to spend a little over $60/pp for three courses but I'd definitely pop by again for just the steaks alone.I highly recommend enjoying the sights and sounds of the scenic walk back into Clarke Quay after a hearty meal at Les Bouchons - there's no better way to work off those juicy calories, then to enjoy good company in the cool evening breeze!"

The steaks are generally excellent value. The amount of meat you're getting for the price you pay? Plus free flow fries? And deliciously crisp and fluffy fries at that? It's a great place for the hungry meat eater.The desserts are HUGE. We had... something. It was a sundae of chocolate and vanilla and it was delicious chocolate sauce (the real stuff, not chocolate-flavoured nonsense), ice cream, and basically it fed four already very full people quite comfortably.Why just two stars after that though?Our steaks were all underdone. We ordered one rare, two medium rare, and one medium, and I think I can safely say that they were all roughly one step under-cooked. My rare was closer to blue, but that's splitting hairs really and overall I was happy with it. The medium rares and mediums though, those were noticeably undercooked. When a medium steak still has slightly translucent glossy bits of meat, that's definitely underdone. The beurre cafe de Paris was absent, and while some other (not very tasty) butter was provided instead, they was definitely a little stingy with it.Beyond the steak, the terrine was possibly one of the worst, worst worst terrines I've had in my life. Yes, including the ones you buy from a supermarket, or the ones you find in an international buffet. This one was barely edible, and I'd highly recommend you give it a miss.So after all that, would I still recommend Les Bouchons? Sure.Great value steak, great fries, and wonderful desserts. Recipe for a good evening here: skip the starters, order your steak slightly overcooked because it'll turn up undercooked (net result = just right) and then use the remaining space to have one of their gigantic desserts to yourself.I might go back... except none of the people that i went with want to."

If you are need a good amount of meat, maybe with some sides, maybe with some wine, but meat, more importantly - this is the place for you.There was a number of us so we got various cuts along with a grilled meat platter. We ended passing our different cuts of meats around - not quite the best of dining habits but 'twas good to be able to try the different cuts for starters. I liked the slight charred taste to their steaks, which adds a nice kick to the bite. My lamb was unfortunately just that bit too rare for my liking but otherwise, the beef is good. You may get tempted by fanciful sounding other names on the menu (like I did) but just get your favourite cut and you can't go wrong. Test it out with the different sauces - mustard, honeygrain mustard, etc.Now that we got the meat part aside, you get to start your meal with unlimited buns. You also get unlimited salads and frites to go with your steaks. They were good, but the steaks stole the show. We didn't go for refills in the end. Expect to fork out around $60/pax. Quite alright if you're looking to indulge. I've read a couple of compaints about the service.

Beef steaks of various cuts and sizes. A marinated lamb dish is also available. We passed on desserts based on previous reviews. All reasonably priced. The wine list of 10 whites and 10 reds is adequate but as expected, weighted to European names. We ordered 2 Ribeyes, a caprese salad, accompanied by a 3rd Cru Pomerol Bordeaux listed as a 2010 vintage. The waitress brought the wine, showed me the label from about 6 feet away. I asked if she could bring it closer and immediately saw it was a 2002. 12 years in the bottle would have only detracted from this wine and I asked if she had the the 2010 as listed. More puzzled looks, more explanations, another offer to pour this vintage ""at the same price"" .. More discussion on why I didn't want the 2002 and after determining they did not have a 2010, I asked if she could please bring the wine list back. We eventually had a wonderfully similar 2012 St Emillion. The steaks and frites were fine. This establishment could be between a 3 and 4 stars based on its food, improvements in its wine list, its location and the fit out. But from my experiences with many Singaporean restaurants with heavy tourist traffic, the evening is ruined by poorly trained front staff and a constant push to turn over the tables quickly while playing Russian roulette with what wine is poured."

I had the rib eye steak which was quite good but the fries are burnt. My partner had the Normandy steak but there was nothing special about it other than the portion was huge. I would actually recommend just getting the rib eye. We had creme brûlée  for dessert and was not impressed at all. The sugar on top was too thin and not burnt enough to have that crackling sound and taste and the custard was too soft. Comparing it with another french restaurant with the same theme, I prefer the other place more"

The first time we came after lunch they were one hr from closing and they were NOT happy to serve us but we decided to stay anyways, I am not a terrible person so we ordered quickly and ate super fast but they kept giving us mean looks and they practically took the plate away while I had food on my fork! I felt super rushed and we left within 45 mins. Today I went for dinner, was not greeted well and they CLEARLY stated they have pasta and pizza specials which is buy one and get one. I asked the waitress and she confirmed it and showed me on the menu, another waiter a male came and I confirmed again and we ordered pastas and drinks. They ignored us the rest of the time and when the bill came it was for the full amount with no special, I tried to call the waiter and he ignored me 3 times, finally he came and I showed him the bill he took it from my hand, did not let me finish my sentence and went to correct it which tells me he knew it was wrong the entire time. He was rude and I will certainly not go back."

We really liked the ambience, the service, and the crowd dining there, but the food was unfortunately underwhelming. The prices for wine by the glass are very reasonable. My prosecco cost less than $10 and you know how many places you have pay more than $12 for beer? I had the fettuccine with bacon and sundried tomato, my fiancé had this fusilli with pesto sauce and salmon. My sauce was way too salty and it was overall a very confusing flavor. My fiancé's dish came with maybe five measly small bites of salmon. The taste wasn't that much better than the presentation. If you just want to get couple glasses of wine and grab some light fare, maybe give it a shot. But don't expect too much of the food."

It's a rather drab looking joint but I'm willing to over look that since the likes of Da Luca have seen better days too. It strikes me as a neighborhood joint where you can pick up a pizza/pasta to go or dine in with a book if you felt like it. We sat facing the kitchen and there were no Italians in sight, which may or may not have been a warning bell because we've eaten at Indian-run Italian joints and they turn out decent pizzas. If you're a stickler for Italian-ness, there was some smarmy Italian music playing so there you go. We popped in here for a pre-theatre meal on Saturday.After we were shown to our table, we sat down and the waiter laid our table and placed a bottle of olive oil in the center. We expected some bread to appear since other tables had some but I guess our table fell though the cracks. We started our meal with one of the day's specials - burratina  with parma ham, salami and rocket leaves. This was the highlight of our meal as  the cheese was fresh (though a little sloppy even for a home made one) and went very well with the salty cold cuts and bitter leaves. My only gripe is that it cost more than our mains, but not a big deal. For mains, I had a crabmeat spaghetti with vodka sauce while the dude had an aglio olio. Both dishes were terribly bland, which is not something you'd expect with a vodka sauce or pasta tossed in spices. The aglio olio looked strikingly similar to a vongole as it had *some* garlic, no peperoncino or parsley, let alone some pecorino to top it off. You can imagine how much fun that was to consume.We paid about $70 for these 3 dishes and no wine, so I would definitely say that I've had better."

It's cozy, the coffee's good and food is great - especially for the price.It's right down the street from where I live. So when I need some down-time to myself on the weekend, i'd head down here with a good book for a cup of latte and sandwiches. If the weather is nice you can people-watch by the river while enjoying your meal too! Love!On to the food - I usually get one of their sandwiches. It's easy no frills sandwich and cheap for what it is - they're priced at $8,$10 and $15. My favorite is the smoked salmon one for $10.I've had their big breakfast too and it's relatively cheap for about $15-16. It's a proper breakfast. Their mini toasties are good for if you don't feel like having any of the above but still want something to nibble on.Coffee is excellent.The only down side is, seating is mostly outdoors and there are no A/C, which can be downright unbearable when it's especially hot in Singapore"

I saw Kith and recalled that I had been at their other location by Dhoby Ghaut and did not find it horrible so I was up for giving it a shot (and to be honest at this point I would probably even have given McDonalds a chance). Kith has a pretty relaxed setting at a corner of a house with some shade but it does not really have any seats inside so even if it is shaded it is still fairly warm.I had some pretty decent pasta with a pretty good flat white while S went for a toastie and a freshly pressed juice. Neither of these were anything special but more what one can expect and prices are a bit higher than I would like to pay but then it is Robertson Quay after all so perhaps to be expected. I have since been a few more times and they are in a sense reliable, there has so far never been anything amazing nor anything really disappointing. It can tend to get a bit too noisy around as many families with children appear to like to come here and at least when I have been there it has been the type of people who do not feel like telling their kids to behave and take it easy so if that disturbs you it may not be the best place."

What I like about Kith is that it's kinda cute and quirky, it's always sincere and honest..and that reflects in the coffee, food and service.It operates out of a tiny space but they expand quite a bit outside. The tables and chairs are built for small people (luckily I'm one) but many tall expatriates seem to squeeze in comfortably (kid in tow). I personally think the old location was prettier inside..more seating but the new location is less food-fumey and has more shade so I think overall it's better.The food is simple and straightforward but there are little touches of brilliance. Love their white bread in the big brek always nicely toasted and love the homely strawberry jam - it really looks like someone spent all day cooking it on the hearth.Free wifi - always a nice bonus.Prices for the big brek and coffee are attractive. I've had the toastie several times for a lighter bite and it's very simple but it's served nice and hot with a tart apple salad on the side.The coffee is not the best but it's usually a nice to good cup..at $3.80 it's worth it. If you get a cup that's over-extracted and bitter, give your feedback to the staff. I think they will hasten to replace it."

It was part of a chain which started in Shanghai in 2009 and currently having about 30 outlets in China. For the hotpot soup bases, there was choices such as Mala, Kampong Chicken Nutritious Chestnut Soup, Fresh Mushroom Soup, Pork Trotter Soup, Tomato Soup and Pickled vegetables Fish Soup. For the types of pot, there was the single soup base pot, pot with nine grid-like compartments, where ingredients can be cooked separately, Double circle or ""son and mother"" pot, which has a smaller circular compartment in the middle that is usually used for non-spicy stock,and the usual yuan yang pot that holds two types of soup bases.Kampong Chicken Nutritious Chestnut Yuan Yang Soup Pot 甘榜鸡板栗养生鸳鸯汤锅 ($27)It came with a quarter chicken and assorted vegetables in the chicken soup base. The soup was very rich and creamy, while the vegetables were very soft.One could add beef butter or chilli to increase the spiciness in the mala soup base, although it was already quite spicy.There were various sauces and condiments available which was chargeable at $4 per person. We had the following items with the hotpot :Fresh Pork Aorta 鲜猪黄喉 ($12[Normal], $7[Small]) It was my first time having this and the texture was quite chewy. The staff told us that it needed 10 seconds to cook. Spicy House Tripe 辣府毛肚 ($12[Normal], $7[Small]) Similar to the above item, it needed 10 seconds to cook. We were told it was beef tripe. The texture was slightly less chewy compared to the pork aorta.Beef Slices 特级肥牛 ($14)The meat was very tender and silky smooth.Beef Cube 牛仔粒 ($32 [Normal], $18 [Small])Although it looked quite frozen when served, the meat was quite tender and soft.Spicy Fresh Fish Slices 麻辣鲜鱼片 ($16 [Normal], $9 [Small]) Although it was spicy, I felt that the saltiness had overwhelmed all the taste. Maybe with beer it would tone down the taste a tab.Mashed Prawn Meat 鲜虾滑 ($15)Served in a cute heart shape, the staff helped us to scoop into balls into the soup. The meat was juicy and bouncy.Spicy House Home Made Juicy Mashed Beef Balls 辣府手工撒尿牛肉丸 ($16 [Normal], $6 [5 pieces]) Beware of this meatball when eating, especially the centre part, where it was filled with flavourful soup. Bouncy, chewy and juicy.Bamboo Shoot 竹筍 ($12[Normal]) The staff told us that it was flown in a couple of days ago from China. It was served thin sliced into thin sheets. The texture was silky smooth, unlike the usual bamboo shoot we had locally. A must order!Bamboo Fungus竹荪 ($12[Normal], $6.50[Small]) Another item flown in from China, in dried version. The texture was very good, with crunchy feel.Mushroom Platter 鲜菇拼盘 ($20)Tofu 老豆腐 ($5)Fried Prawn Rice 虾仁炒饭 ($10)Surprisingly the dish was made with short grain rice, not with the usual long grain rice commonly found in Singapore. Although it was short grain, the rice was not sticky. The cubes of vegetable was soft and flavourful.As for dessert, we hadRaw Sugar Rice Cake Stick 黄糖糍粑 ($7 [8 pieces], $4 [4pieces])It was made of glutinous rice, and topped with red sugar syrup. The syrup's colour was quite similar to chilli oil, that we almost thought that we were having another spicy dish. The simple looking rice stick was chewy inside like mochi, while encased with a thin, light crispy crust. Very nice on its own even without the syrup.Overall the food was not bad. The place was relatively quiet which allowed one to enjoy the meal in peace. Maybe could be due to the reason the place was located at the far end of Clarke Quay and most people still did not know about it.

I would definitely go back for some wine and tarte flambes.  There are a few miscues, such as bottles being refrigerated too much and the gooey mess of a mashed potato.  But I applaud them for their ambitious menu, and with a few tweaks, they could be even better."

Even though i used to frequent this spot, i've not noticed Verre, formerly a wine bar hidden behind dark and heavy drapes. Thankfully, after a relaunch, Verre Modern Bistro and Wine Bar has lost all that darkness and brought light, and great food to its mix. The new direction cannot be a better choice really. With their expertise in wine (they have over 750 labels of fine wine mainly from Bordeaux and Burgundy), Verre is able to provide great pairings with their Modern French dishes created by Chef Consultant Masashi Horiuchi (who also manages Shelter in the Woods). We had an extensive night of food and wine pairings, something easily done since one could have over 30 wines by the glass with your food choice.A good start to a meal at Verre would be the creamy Chicken Liver Parfait ($24) paired with a reduction of port wine, madeira wine shallot, balanced with a tangy mandarin orange jelly and a dehydrated honeycomb-like mandarin orange. This was paired with a dry lemon lime Paringa Estate Riesling 2012 ($19.50). The Half Lobster Salad ($38) features a sweet Maine lobster cooked in court bouillon, with a creamy guacamole and a refreshing calamansi and honey dressing. I would order this dish for the sweet and tangy dressing! The wine pairing was the Stick Chardonnay 2013 ($18) with flavors of grapefruit, white peach, citrus and oak spice.I loved the Black Garlic Soup ($19), which was made with a white wine chicken stock and black garlic. That clove of roasted black garlic was icing on the cake and gave the soup a slightly tangy sweet preserved plum flavor. We had the dark fruity Massalino Dolcette D Alba 2013 ($18) to go with this.The Pan-seared Scallops with Sweet Corn ($38) was an absolute stunner. The corn flavor was immensely intense and the pickled konbu gave the dish an umami lift.Onto the bigger dishes. I'm not a fan of the Seafood Papillote ($30) of oven baked seafood. It was a little too bland for my liking though that toasted dill bread with gruyere was perfect for mopping up the stock. Do not go away without having some of that gorgeous Suckling Pig ($42) done 2 ways. One part slow roasted for 4 - 5h and braised with spices; and another slow braised for 12h with a tangy Asian marinade of orange, honey, and spice. Give me a bun and make me a slider out of this pulled pork mix with Iberico ham and pickled onions already!I was extremely pleased with the meat selection at Verre. The Fillet of Wagyu Beef ($62) can have my body and soul. Just look at that pink flesh (best enjoyed slightly rare)! And hand over that umami American potato truffle fries, seasoned with truffle shavings and truffle oil. I'm sure there's some soy sauce in there somehow. No bottled ketchup here by the way. We'll go with the homemade mushroom ketchup made with madeira wine and pickled mushrooms. Have this with the classic full bodied Massolino Barolo 2010 ($32) and you'd be in cow heaven. After that heavy meal, I was grateful for the light refreshing desserts. I enjoyed the deconstructed Apple Mille-Feuille ($16) A LOT. We had apple in all forms- macerated apple with lemon juice, sorbet, compote, and caramelized, with layers of caramalised filo pastry and vanilla custard cream flavored with Calvados. That cream THAT CREAM!! The dessert wine award goes to the Caprilli Moscadello ($15), a silky and refreshing drink which was sweet but light enough.Other hits include the Saint-Honore ($10) filled with the mind blowing vanilla pastry cream and chantilly! The Canele ($4) was pretty good too but could be more crisp. Certainly one of the better ones because I"

Verre does in that sense fill a gap, and a bit surprisingly (perhaps not in having a good wine selection but decent prices seldom goes hand in hand with this area) it is in a rather touristy and expat heavy area.This bar/restaurant is located along Robertson Quay and has both nice outdoor seating area as well as a fairly large dining room. It has never been very busy when I have been here so have always been able to get a seat without reservations. Service has always been friendly and fast so a big plus for that.The wine selection is pretty good, I counted 8 reds and 8 whites by the glass and 1 sparkling. Very decent prices and for their happy hour it is really good (from 4-7 pm on weekdays and 4-6pm on weekends) with buy 1 get 1 free offer on the wines by the glass and some beers. Their champagne by the glass is for example the excellent Guy Charlemagne Brut (for a review of thier 2008 check out thewinecurious.wordpress…) and at 18 SGD for 2 glasses it is excellent value for money.The selection of wines by the bottle is also good, a lot from France but also from other parts of the world. Prices are pretty good as well so really a pleasant experience.They do also have a full food menu. I have had the food and it is not bad but also not something very special. I mainly come here for the fine but occassionally also eat here and have never been really disappointed but also never really escited about it either. Expect pastas and other European dishes on the me u.Overall this is one of my favorite places for wine in Singapore."

That should have been my first sign. I decided to sit inside anyways in front of the lovely wine cellar. I asked the waiter what was good on the menu and felt he didn't know the menu too well as he stumbled for explanations. I ordered a glass of Pinot (it needed to open up greatly) and one of the savory tarts flambé. I patiently waited for this as I listened to the children (!) from a few tables over scream and run back and forth to the door. That wasn't the relaxing dining experience I was looking for after having a 14-hr work day. My tart finally came and it was dry and lacked the savoriness I expected. I ate it and paid the check.

This is an extremely important fact as their protein portions are usually large and delicious that it calls for an extra portion of carbs to prolong the umami enjoyed.The Nasu was nicely caramelized with miso and tender to the bite, although the pork tasted a little too sweet, requiring some of the Japanese rice and savoury kaijiru to wash down.The highlight of the meal had to be the grilled mackerel that Yayoiken prides itself on. With a charred crispy skin on the underside and juicy, fatty meat on the inside, this is enough to make non-fish fans rethink their opinion. Some might be put off by the presence of bones on the fish, but these can be easily removed in a swift pry from the center, leaving one with just the fleshy insides to enjoy. Having gotten used to the large whole fish one gets in the Shima Hokke Set ($13.90) however, this was a little lacking in portion size and I think I will revert to my usual order of the Shima Hokke when I return for a generous portion of the tender, delicious mackerel.Kaijiru is a must-order with a mere top-up of just $1.90 for plump clams and umami-enhanced miso soup.For pictures and the full review visit voraciousappetite.wordpr…Thanks!"

However, the restaurant isn't too shabby. In fact, it gives me a familiar Cantonese resto vibe, which I enjoy actually. Staff are suitably friendly, and dishes are by and large authentic & yummy. More hits than misses. Now on to the food!!1) yusheng / lohei - this was a delight. The mock salmon looked positively real. Whilst tasty enough, the slightly hypochondriac me was wondering if it was made out of many chemicals. Hahahaha. One lovely bit was the crispy fish skin!!! I don't think I've ever had yusheng with crispy fish skin which provided a lovely crunchy texture to this age-old dish. 2) double-boiled superior soup with almonds - oh, this i LURVED!!!! Wow! Just so ambrosial and heavenly. Soup lovers would be over the moon with this one. Guaranteed. Seriously. 3) poon Choy - Award-winning Chef Julian Tam supposedly was the first to introduce this Cantonese dish to Singapore. And his version is authentic and doesn't disappoint. Chockful of expensive delicacies like abalone, dried scallops, fish maw, sea cucumber, shrimp, meats and veggies go into that claypot. The sauce is phenomenal and warrants a bowl of white rice. Yes, the rice is a MUST. 4) sautéed ""peach resin"" with egg white - ok, this dish didn't look too appetizing but the flavors were tremendously delicious. The egg whites and some century eggs (I could be mistaken with the latter) and veggies.... They all went together like nutella and toast. Very awesome. 5) wild cod fish - it looked like art, like a calligraphic painting. Very interesting way of cooking it - if you notice, the filleted fish is fried but the fish slices are steamed and placed by the side. How perfectly contrasting! Me likey!!! Mucho!!!6) roasted duck - while yummy, it didn't strike me as fantastic. Nothing out of the ordinary. But yummy nonetheless. 7) glutinous rice with Chinese sausages - yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!!!!!!!!! What a way to end with this staple! I don't know why, but I enjoyed this laap mei faan very much. The Chinese sausages went terrifically well with the sticky rice. A true winner. 8) custard buns - honestly, this was a let down and the worst dish of the night. The skin (bun) was tough, and the custard was watery. A pity, cos it looked so yummy! All in all, I really really enjoyed my meal. Chef Julian came out to say hi to us and he is friendliest, most humble and humorous chef.

How good can it be when it's not even one of the Top 3 Wagyu Beef in Japan? Yes, I had those questions in mind too but when I had a bite of the Kyoto Beef, I nearly wanted to flip the tables. (Just kidding) Trust me, this breed of cow is just as elite as the vegetables and tofu produce from Kyoto.Wagyu purists might disagree but I do not care. This is definitely my ideal cattle because of the regular marbling of fats make this a balanced cut that is tender yet not too fatty. Kobe beef felt like swallowing a whole chunk of butter and I couldn't proceed after one. But not for this. The one-week Kyoto fair is run by Okamoto san, an experienced chef with a restaurant in Kyoto. ALL ingredients, from the pickles in the appetizers to the strawberries in dessert are all imported from Kyoto. There is ala carte menu but the lunch/dinner course is much more highly recommended for the full quality experience. The price ranges from $28 to $100, which is jaw-droppingly reasonable for the excellent standards of the meal. But that's not the end. The dessert brought the Kyoto meal to another climax. Matcha Fondue. Yes, dark green liquid served WARM with Kyoto Strawberries, Warabi Mochi, Matcha Cake and Shiratama Dango. This was so ridiculously good that I licked my fondue cup clean. Blissful. The beef, the tofu, the matcha. Every ingredient played their respective role in he course. Looks like this meal has set a high standard for 2015 and honestly speaking, it's difficult to find another place in Singapore that can beat this in terms of value and quality."

Actually, there is no way to ascertain what kind of pork you are getting. Furthermore, there was too little sauce in the rice. Overall quality of the black pig tonkatsu was below average.The only dish that we liked was the potato salad. The potato salad had bits of cucumber, onions, carrots in it.

It was slightly tough and a little too salty for my liking. Cheryl L agreed and was pretty upset cos it's usually very tender and the meat actually melts in your mouth. So much for our first dish.When the Ramen came, I was a little apprehensive. But the broth did not disappoint! Though it's stated that it's spicy (1 chilli), it's not spicy at all. For someone who cant take food that's too spicy, this was perfect for me (but for lovers of chilli, you might need to get them to increase the dosage!). The Fried Pork Ribs were great too. However, I'm not used to very salty food, I couldnt continue after about 4 pieces. Cheryl L happily consumed the rest. Heh."

In short, everything tasted fresh and yummy. It's value for money (not overpriced) and definitely worth repeat visits to try more of their extensive menu! Since they're famous for the ramen, we tried the Deluxe black pig shabu ramen. The broth was really flavorful - I was told they actually make their own bone soup as the broth base, not some chemical concoction. There are lotsa add-ons too like the flavored egg and spicy mentaiko. Their tonkatsu was really good... we ordered the premium loin black pig tonkatsu. I don't think I've had better tonkatsu - the meat was super juicy and tender yet the batter was extremely crunchy. Waaay better than what I've had at Tonkichi. I really liked their desserts too. We ordered the milk pudding, matcha warabi mocha and matcha parfait. I think they're all winners, though my fave was the milk pudding - silky soft and full of milky goodness!"

My first experience was to try their signature black pig shabu ramen and I must say I was very satisfied with what I had. It was authentic and very similar to the ramen I had when I was in Japan and the paper thin black pig pork belly slices simply melts in my mouth.

They're most known for their pork bone soup ramen, and my family and I have been there enough times to say for sure that you do not need to be seen at a stuffy and uptight Japanese restaurant to eat good ramen. If it's anything that describes the ramen at this place, is that it is both cheap and flavourful. You can really taste the richness of flavour in soup stock ; one spoon full of the ramen soup really packs a punch. All this at an affordable price of $14-16 a bowl. Not to mention the lovely Japanese sponge cheesecake that I love to end my heavy lunch with. It's the perfect balance of sweet and light.

The patatas bravas were acceptable,, the croquettes pretty good while the cheese and cold cuts can rather be skipped and the same goes for the padron peppers.

Had the paella (can't remember the name and can't seem to find anything similar on their online menu, but it was the only one with no seafood in it) which was really good, well-cooked and satisfying (or maybe it's just because I was super hungry LOL). One of the best ones I've had in Singapore, on par (or perhaps even better) than the version in Serenity. Way cheaper too! Came in a large pan which was more than enough for 3. We also had the Catalunya pizza ($13)- really simple with only a topping of anchovies and vegetables but well-excecuted. The crust was thin yet flavourful, and very cripsy. And it was big for its price! Dessert was the Crema Catalana ($10) - essentially Creme Brulee. Nice but not sensational, but big enough for 3!. Still, it was a very good meal and worth it for the prices. 3 dishes filled the 3 of us up quite well- a feat considering that we'd been starving for 9 hours before that!Found it quite difficult to get the attention of waiters but they were helpful and polite when they finally came to our table."

For a weekday night, the place was packed with customers. Besides the penang fare, one could also find cold seafood such as crayfish, cooked prawns and mussels on ice.Can't help noticing that everyone just went straight for Tow Kwa Pok. The moment one opened the cover, it smelt so mouth watering. Stuffed with minced pork and vegetables, topped with brown sauce and chilli sauce, it was so delicious.We were lucky to get a plate of freshly fried Char Kway Teow which one could taste the wok hei in it. Remember to help yourself the crispy pork lards. Accompanied the meal with Teh Tarik which tasted not bad at first but felt watered down after having the heavy stuffs. The manager said said that the restaurant used to served Teh Halia (Ginger Tea) but replaced it with Teh Tarik after feedback from customers. There was a number of live stations for Hokkien Mee Thng, Penang Laksa, Kway Teow Thng, Ark Thui Mee Sua Thng, Kueh Pie Tee, Popiah, and Ban Chang Kueh. The broth for the Hokkien Mee Thng was quite rich and flavourful. The Penang Laksa was not bad but the broth was not spicy and sour enough for local Penang taste. The Ban Chang Kueh was light and crispy even after left on the table for quite sometimes. It was made freshly by an old auntie who looked old enough to be my grandma.There was also rare local dishes such as Char Moey and Nasi Ulam which were rare to find these days, but the porridge was lacking of wok hei taste, while the other latter was kind of bland. The Pig Stomach Soup was full bodied and peppery without offending smell or taste from the meat.For dessert, the freshly scooped Tau Huay with Gula Melaka was smooth with kind of an old school feel. The Apom Bokwa was soft and went quite well with the banana sauce. The assorted kuehs such as Kueh Dadar, Kueh Bengkah, Pulut Tai Tai (served with Kaya), Kueh Talam, Abuk-Abuk, Kueh Lapis, Ang Ku Kueh (Tau Sa), and Rice Bengkah  were cut into small pieces. Soft and yummy."

I don't know about that, but it might just be Singapore's Most Expensive Penang Buffet. For almost $50++ per person for weekday lunch while having neither fresh seafood besides prawns and mussels nor a carving station, nor a particularly large spread, this is certainly a pricey buffet to go to.This being a buffet, it is impractical for me to review everything I ate, so I shall make general observations and talk more about a few specific dishes. In general, most of the savory dishes ranged from okay to pretty good.The char kway teow, perhaps the highlight of any Penang buffet, used to be the best my family had found in Singapore. Sadly, the standard has dropped and now it is rather pedestrian, without much wok hei (wok smokey flavour) or flavour not much.On the other hand, the kueh pie ti was good, being both crunchy and savory. The soups too were excellent - the salted vegetable and duck soup fully extracted the flavours of its components, and the pig stomach soup was both tasty and featured stomach that was very smooth (i.e. clean).The Penang Curry Chicken was excellent, being really well spiced, and rich without being overwhelmingly so. The Nasi Ulam (spiced rice) was interesting - I haven't tried it before and it was a delightful culinary experience with the refreshing mixture of flavours in my mouth.The Herbal Duck Mee Sua had a rich soup but was too herbal for my taste. The Penang Laksa taste alright but was quite thin.What really stood out here, I must say, were the desserts.The beancurd dessert was sublime - it was so smooth and slippery, it was like biting into a cloud (though the gula melaka syrup didn't exactly complement it).There was also a large selection of nonya kuehs (cakes). They were cut into small pieces, making it easy for one to try many of them. All of them were very good, with smooth, rich tastes.The ban chang kueh (crispy peanut pancake) was not quite as good crispy but it was rather dry and there was no chewiness to balance the crispiness out. It was quite peanuty but was a touch under sweetened.In short, if you find a good credit card deal, or you really like Penang food it might be worth coming here once in a while. Otherwise you should only come once in a long while since it's really pricey. Or you could always go to Penang instead."

When I was younger, I liked that you could make your own ice kachang, but now that I'm a little older, I like the prawns the most I think. There is a cold section of the buffet and a hot section, on the side, you can order a variety of noodle soups and down a few stairs is the dessert station. It's not that large, but I think there is something for everyone. I liked the steamed Chong fun, the curry, the steamed fish paste thing, and the soups. The duck and noodles and pork I could pass on. I ate maybe 15 boiled prawns, but they were soooo delicious!! Definitely my favorite! Being from the US, where the fruit is terrible, I still end my meal with a few slices of watermelon. I also still make my own ice kachang lol. I don't really like any of the cakes, but there is a good selection of them. Oh, the tofu dessert was also good:) Also, try the ginger tea near the desserts!

The otak otak (fish mousse wrapped in banana leaf) and the kerabu bee hoon (rice vermicelli salad) were also good.  The pig's stomach soup and duck meat herbal soup (ark thui mee sua thg) were very flavorful and warming, but light at the same time.  Best of all were the desserts, with 6 or 7 different kinds of homemade kueh (Malaysian sweets) to choose from, and even a ban chang kueh station serving up the peanut pancakes to order!  There's also a banana caramel sauce that I could (and did) just eat by the spoonful, by itself (though it's supposed to go on apom balik pancakes).Not everything was great.  The ayam goreng was overcooked and dry, and the fried fish fillets tasted like the generic dish you would find in any Westernized Chinese restaurant.  But the best part is, you can leave anything you dislike on the plate! The restaurant staff were really helpful in explaining what each dish was and the ingredients in them.  They actively encouraged me to try every dish, even though this admonition inevitably led to a bit of waste, as I had no choice but to take little bites while leaving the rest of the food on the plate.  They were very good about clearing away the dirty plates, too.  +1 star for pretty great service.Overall, unless you actually have a go-to Nonya for all your favorite Penang dishes, the buffet at Princess Terrace is a great way to try out generally quite good renditions of many different dishes, some quite hard to find in Singapore.  P.S. - I used a Citibank card and got an 18% discount off the bill.  This deal lasts at least through December 31, 2012."

No problem and they also asked if we wanted another accompaniment like mayonnaise instead. Helpful service! Even better the lemon wedge came with a little stainless steel lemon slice squeezer so you don't have to use your fingers. Another thoughtful little touch. The dish was fine. I find squid is squid. If it is not rubbery, I'm good.The owner asks how is your food. I don't hear this asked often enough on this little island. He engages in some conversation but short enough to not be intrusive. He wants you to dine before the dish gets cold. It is these little things that make the dining experience.Gli Gnocchi alla Fiorentina (dumpling potato pasta sautéed with minced beef and mushroom in a pink sauce)I'm a sucker for potato anything and this dish was calling my name. It had the right potato to flour proportion and I ate it up. The meat sauce was very enjoyable and Steven, seeing how I was really likely my dish, suggested their 6 cheese sauce gnocchi next time. Can't wait!Pappardelle con Gamberoni in Salsa di Zafferano (handmade flat pasta sautéed with king prawns and sundried tomatoes in a saffron sauce)The pasta noodles were surprisingly light and delicate considering their long, almost sheet-like shape. A hint of saffron made this dish very rewarding to tuck into. Alas I only got one mouthful as it was devoured by my better half.We were in a rush, so moved out without dessert. I would also note to readers that they also have a pizza oven to serve take out pizza or you can dine in.

Rather average, now to think of it.We also had for mains, the Italiana pizza ($22). It is white pizza with parma ham. It was not much of the thin-crust variety and lacked a bit in terms of the texture or 'exciting taste' department. It was a very.. safe pizza.

Nothing could go severely wrong when fresh squid is used to make this Golden Calamari rings ($18) instead of rubbery frozen kinds. These lightly-battered sotongs are better off on its own instead of being dipped into the Diabolo sauce, which may overpower the original taste the meat.Not sure if the flat pasta was undercooked as it was rather tough and not anywhere near ""char kway teow"" nor ""hor fun"" like the owner humorously quipped. However, the saffron sauce with sundried tomato was not too cheesy along with some fresh, bouncy scallops & prawns.For my main course of seafood, I tend to avoid cod fish but this was not overwhelming rich with nicely browned edges.

From the Meat, the highly anticipated beef tenderloin was too thick and thus there was not much taste from the meat or the little sauce. At $42, the quality was not convincing and thus I would still recommend their thin crust pizzas.We were surprised when the Smoked Salmon Pizza ($20) looked like it had just travelled out from the forest with the lush canopy of wild rocket. It was not spicy as I expected, but the bright flavors of capers and onions complemented the smoked salmon very well.Not everyone might be fond of the wobbly Pannacotta ($12) but I do. It was not sweet at all and the dark golden brown caramel sauce was bitter, just the way it should be.On the hindsight, the Cassata($12), a traditional Italian dessert of semifreddo, dried fruits and chocolate sponge was nothing very special. Think ice cream parfait with harder texture.After coming across many mediocre tiramisu at restaurants, Spizzico's version ($12) was a pleasant surprise with moist sponges and traceable amounts of coffee liquor. A simple yet delightful end-of-meal desserts to have.Overall, the food here is relatively sound and I would stick to the pizza, pastas and desserts instead of the seafood/meat course. But what is heartening to know is that the ingredients used at Spizzico are fresh and the sauces are made from scratch. While this place gives me a prim and proper feel with neatly ironed table sheets and heavy utensils, I can imagine it to be a suitable location for families and couples to enjoy quality fare away from the crowds."

Obviously I knew that the experience and food wouldn't be the same or as authentic, and probably a bit overpriced because Octapas is located in the tourist central of Clarke Quay. First off, we made a reservation for a Wednesday night dinner for our friend's birthday. They accidentally gave away our table inside where the live music played (which was not good music anyways) and shifted us outside. At least it was shaded and not too hot outside. We ordered a few tapas and a paella that supposedly fed 4 people. Throughout the course of our dining experience with Octapas, our party progressively became more and more dissatisfied.My extremely small plate of S$12 Champinones al Ajilo (Mushrooms with Garlic) was drenched in oil and salt. I had to chug my entire cup of water while eating it. And, when I asked for more water - it took forever to get the waiter's attention and we had to ask repeatedly (3 times) to get my refill. And, our bland Valenciana (Meat & Seafood) Paella was $60 and finally came after about 45-50 minutes. This dish is supposed to serve 4 people, but it was extremely small, overcooked, and had an awful cardboard taste. There wasn't much meat (chorizos) or seafood either!  Also, our $15 Caipirinha cocktails were extremely sweet and barely had any alcohol in it.  Save your time and money by going somewhere else! I would've rather eaten snacks or a Bao at 7-Eleven."

Upon seating ourselves we we're told that the table we sat at was being used by someone else and if we could move to another table...a reasonable request to which we happily obliged. First up was the drinks, having a quick glance at the slightly pricey cocktail menu I opted for a margherita and was asked if I wanted lime, raspberry or something else that sounded a bit candy store..This would usually be a red flag for me but being extremely hot I wasnt in the mood for scanning the menu again so I just went with the lime. It wasn't the worst but certainly not the best, incredibly sweet and tasted like a premix. For tapas we opted for cheese croquetes, a bruschetta style plate & some lamb cutlets. The croquetes themselves we're OK. But they came with a cinnamon style jam which when used together gave the sensation of eating a cheese donut.... Weird. The bruschetta was a doughy, white bread roll cut in half and spread with a tomato, garlic ish paste. In my opinion inedible. I love lamb cutlets, possibly one of my top 10 favourite meals. These we're OK but extremely fatty, I've never seen cutlets with that much fat around the entire cut (close to half an inch)."

The menu offers simple Spanish fare, some items more traditional than others, but all of it tasty and satisfying. They also have a happy hour, for those who want to eat out on the cheap - always a bonus in my book! Service can be hit or miss, which is unfortunate, but not uncommon in such touristy areas.

I told him that I liked Octapas from my previous trip.I was looking forward to having Paella Valencia again as it is their signature dish. We ordered our drinks from yet another cheery waitress as noticed on my previous visit. When the waitress came back I placed out food order for the Paella as I knew it would take a bit longer to cook. We were into our second cocktail when the kitchen brought out the pan of Paella and took the foil covering off at the table. I can't describe well enough how excellent the dish was enjoyed by the both of us as this was a most delicious meal. I was so glad that my decision to return to this establisment as a treat to my coworker. Our culinary experience was only topped such an attentive staff as well as Manager that personally asked how our meal was being enjoyed.Once again I not only recommend Octapas, but state that I will be back for at least one more dinner here before my business trip concludes. Kudos to the hard working staff that consistently makes this place a favorite of mine in Singapore!"

Obviously I knew that the experience and food wouldn't be the same or as authentic, and probably a bit overpriced because Octapas is located in the tourist central of Clarke Quay. First off, we made a reservation for a Wednesday night dinner for our friend's birthday. They accidentally gave away our table inside where the live music played (which was not good music anyways) and shifted us outside. At least it was shaded and not too hot outside. We ordered a few tapas and a paella that supposedly fed 4 people. Throughout the course of our dining experience with Octapas, our party progressively became more and more dissatisfied.My extremely small plate of S$12 Champinones al Ajilo (Mushrooms with Garlic) was drenched in oil and salt. I had to chug my entire cup of water while eating it. And, when I asked for more water - it took forever to get the waiter's attention and we had to ask repeatedly (3 times) to get my refill. And, our bland Valenciana (Meat & Seafood) Paella was $60 and finally came after about 45-50 minutes. This dish is supposed to serve 4 people, but it was extremely small, overcooked, and had an awful cardboard taste. There wasn't much meat (chorizos) or seafood either!  Also, our $15 Caipirinha cocktails were extremely sweet and barely had any alcohol in it.  Save your time and money by going somewhere else! I would've rather eaten snacks or a Bao at 7-Eleven."

On top of all of this they charge $5 for a bread basket. And the bread is incredibly subpar, and the butter is cheap and of very poor quality.Also the food took an incredibly long time to come and when my friends (who ordered the Paella) got their food, it looked like it sat in a fridge for a couple days before they microwaved it and put it on our table. I don't understand how it could have taken 45 minutes to microwave a dish.Anyways me and my party didn't even eat our food after trying it. We refused to eat it and told the waiter that we refused to pay for their pathetic excuse for food. It certainly doesn't help that their service was just horrendous. So incredibly slow.Also our reservation was not honored and only after standing our ground with the staff did we get a table outside."

Lo and behold, paella came like 10 mins later. While we were eating, the waitress came over and told us that they need to send back the paella as this was for the other table (good for 4) and not for 2.Ok, so they take back the paella to the kitchen to do what again? Add more and serve to another table? And then she came back and said its okay like we owe her.

Most nights, live music can be found at this quaint yet vibrant joint, and you can sip an ice cold beverage of your choice as you watch tourist-laden bumboats float by. The menu offers simple Spanish fare, some items more traditional than others, but all of it tasty and satisfying. They also have a happy hour, for those who want to eat out on the cheap - always a bonus in my book! Service can be hit or miss, which is unfortunate, but not uncommon in such touristy areas. Though in my opinion, the food is well worth the occasional frosty waitress. Try the garlic bread, chorizo, meatballs, bacon wrapped prawns, chicken in cream sauce, and croquettes.Buen provecho!"

Their cheese is delicious, their Parma ham is sprinkled with Parmesan so it's nice and salty, they have Australian and Japanese Wagyu. We opted for Japanese medium rare 260g, did not disappoint.

Wanted the steaks to be medium well and indeed it was -- but they tasted so similar to the hainanese style steak we used to have from many other places.

It's in a busy location, but is slightly in the park, which makes it quite peaceful. I ordered the spicy fried chicken and waffles. They told me it would take 15 minutes...its been more like 25. I had to personally ask the waitress to take my order...that was a bit ridiculous. Also, they had the audacity to give me the bill at a sit down restaurant before I even got my food. However, the food was very delicious! The chicken was freshly fried and seasoned perfectly with the spicy buffalo sauce. The waffle was crispy yet soft the way I like it. The waffle was very tasty and airy. This dish was 5 stars! Overall, I would have given 5 stars if the service was much better. I will be going again because I want to try some other dishes."

Its my own fault and i probably had a mini seizure while ordering.  I saw the tuna melt at the table next to us and it looked GOOD.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The owner seemed really nice and friendly.  The service was good. The coffee was very good.  The location as nice but a little hidden. I honestly had never noticed it before.  I really like places that have an interesting menu.  The items seem fun.  I enjoyed it but felt like I had been nominated for an award but didnt actually win it.  I think I need to go back for dinner. The chili crab mac and cheese and the tuna melt are something I'm super curious to try.  I will need to try it again.

It came with a pretty peach buttercream rose on top, I finished half of it and asked them to box it up.  It was delicious. I have had better.  The lemon filling they use was on point but the cake left something to be desired. I think they use a butter cake recipe that lacks complexity (aka well balanced flavor). Anyways, I was planning on having it for breakfast with my morning coffee.  I like to start my day off by looking at something pretty and there was a very pretty buttercream rose on top of my slice when I handed it to them to box it up.  In the morning... I open up my little box and the rose was gone!!!! They took it off my slice before boxing it up!! WHY?!?! WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?!?!?!They literally ruined my morning."

I love you, Sweets and I'm sorry it took me so long to finally come and sit down for a proper dinner. Beyond all the great reviews that everyone has been ranting about, I really enjoy the atmosphere and warm hospitality by everyone. The food served are rich and supple, servings are very generous, just as Ju says ""My servings are very generous, just like me!"" ;)I had the Ju's Prawn Pappardelle, while my friends has the Spiced Beef Burger and the Prawn Burger. The Burgers were served with Garlic fries, a great complement to lift the tastes of the burgers further. I cant comment on the burgers cos I havent tasted them, but for someone who doesnt usually have creamy pasta, the Prawn pappardelle was awesome. Rich but not overpowering, Ju managed to ensure that the pasta was still kept Al Dente even when it's soaked in the creamy prawn sauce.For desserts, we had the Blueberry Lemon Cake and the Lemon Meringue Pie. The cakes here are big. The textures feel more like pound cakes rather than sponge cakes cos every mouth of cake is full and supple. Love the blueberry jam in between the layers of lemon cake as they complement each other perfectly with the sweetness of the blueberry jam and light lemon flavour. The lemon meringue pie had a really good balance of the sour lemon curd and the light meringue. The tart was buttery and give a good bite to the creamy tart.With all the good food, the only downer is the size of the table. I wished they were slightly bigger to contain all the awesome-ness on the table. :PFor those who of you who has yet to try, head down soon! For those who love this place, good news is, they are going to undergo a little reno in Feb 14 and reopen with a even more hearty menu. Cant Wait!"

Visited on a Saturday afternoon, the cafe was crowded. Thankfully there was an empty table that could sit 6 of us. They have a good selection of cakes available. We ordered the Earl Grey Cake, Lime pie and another cake which I can't quite recall the name. The earl grey cake color was super appealing, somewhat a shade of purple but not quite. It's really pretty. An unconventional taste that isn't too sweet. Would recommend this - not that it's super tasty but more so for its unique taste. The lime pie was really good! You could tell the love for this pie by the speed it disappeared from the plate. Just perhaps a tad too sweet for my taste bud, still a absolutely must have.can't recall the last cake we had, it's good too. Given its name, the cakes meets our expectation. A great place to hang with friends and hide from the blazing heat. Limited parking at the park.

Better yet, his kitchen occupies the former men's changing room! Boss promises only fully clothed occupants now though.Yes, the shop's called The Fabulous Baker Boy, but he does so much more. There's a  healthy menu that is being re-jigged to include some pretty yum Big Boy Tacos, which he did make for me and the Girlfriend today as an early preview treat! Look out for the guacomole - it's got a little something extra in it that makes it even more yum.Also, look out for the prawn fettucine - I've heard rave/ravenous/raving oh never mind. I've heard great things about it, and it's set to be offered for both lunch and dinner services very soon.Then we come to the cakes. Why hello there, my pretty... okay enough with the creepy tapping fingers, but the scheming minds are very much needed here, because you'll need to plan wisely to maximise how much cake you can get in your belly. There are just SO MANY OPTIONS. Always ask for suggestions - that way I found out that the Nutty Monkey (banana cake in peanut butter frosting and coconut flakes in between) had just come back on to the list! On suggestion, we'd also picked up a slice of lemon and raspberry cake, which was a great choice to help cut through the ""jelat""-ness/heaviness of the Nutty Monkey.They've got a variety of bevs for you to sit tai-tai style and watch the world go by - coffee, a homemade iced tea, and beer and wine too, if you'd like.Also try: everything else.

However, I can see why they need the tables. everyone wants a taste and feel of home on a saturday!the dessert was well done. i had the blueberry yoghurt cake while my friend had the raspberry cake. very well done and not too sweet. goes well with a cup of coffee. one gripe is that their latte art needs a bit more work (not consistent and a little sloppy).Overall, this is not just another restaurant checked off the list. a very impressive service staff that makes you keep coming back because you feel welcomed and at home. of course the dessert junkie in me is prepping for the next visit to try ALL their cakes.

Don't reinvent the wheel."" Those were the thoughts that ran through my head as i sat through the preview of The Fabulous Baker Boy's new dinner menu. If only Juwanda were to stick to his brunch fare and cakes, I'm pretty sure people would love to have that for dinner as well.Let's start with my favorite part of the meal- the cakes. TFBB is known for their cakes and while there were hits and misses (Green Tea Praline was too dry, Red Velvet a tad sweet), the latest addition, the Pam D'OR stole the limelight. This cake was created in honor of Juwanda's muse, actress Pamela Oei, a dear friend of his. What's better than sticky date pudding? A sticky date cake sandwiched with layers of butterscotch and cream cheese. Oh brown sugar, latte butter cream, and Valrhona chocolate. This cake wouldn't always be available in store but i think it should be made a staple. A 3kg 9"" cake will set you back by $105 and each slice is $10. Love this one!Back to the dinner menu, skip the salads and starters as they are quite blah. The Almond Encrusted Salmon with a mango hollandaise ($22) had several decent elements, such as the fragrant fat-free mango hollandaise sauce that had just a hint of sweetness. The salmon was a little overcooked but still palatable and would certainly do well with more sauce. The contrasting textures could be enhanced with a creamier spinach rather than one that looked like it came through the cold pressed machine but the flavor of the veg was on point.I thought the Duck Confit ($21) was regular and by regular i do mean that it's not too bad. One of the more flavorful dishes of the night and the plus points were that it was fork tender and not too dry. I liked the cranberry plum compote that accompanied the duck.Steak Frites ($25) 230g NZ grass fed sirloin, grilled on the griddle, dressed with mushrooms and caramelised onions and the horrible fries. No comments on this one as it was forgettable. The fries were just horrid i can't even begin to describe them (gosh the oil).Serious room for improvement in the Fish Burger ($14.50). The components that i liked about this dish don't maketh a burger- the tangy Siracha tartar sauce, hint of curry leaves in the batter and the buttery billowing brioche. The batter needs to be WAAAY thinner and the fish needs more flavor on its own. Comes with the same horrible fries. The bastardized Fried Chicken &amp; Waffles ($21) which was served with a half chicken. The horrors!!! Always chicken fillet. ONLY chicken fillet. I didn't like this dish due to the super hard and dense waffle and the overdose of syrup on this one (it was already drenched when served). TFBB definitely needs to work this one out man. That said, the meat was sufficiently moist though the buttermilk flavor could be enhanced.Well well, that's my honest take on TFBB's dinner menu. Honestly i'm pretty certain customers would be happy with an all day brunch menu here with some heartier options. I do hope they work things the kinks out for dinner. In the meantime, be glad that you can now enjoy a slice (or two) with the extended opening hours at TFBB!"

I expect a fairly high standard if you describe yourself as fabulous, and those expectations were certainly bumped out by the display of more than ten cakes. all tall, all colorful, and as easily orderable as they are pinterest-able.but the flavors? non-existing. the only thing you could taste was the dry sponge that seemed to make a showing in both our slices, a stale sort of crumbly butter cake. the icing was essentially colored-but-barely-flavored buttercreamwe took a mouthful each, and stopped after the first bite.so the meal is marked for me by our leftover slices of cake - which almost never happens. most slices of cake still turn out pretty much edible: it's just butter, sugar and sweet stuff, no? but these were so bad we couldn't ourselves to eat anymore - which is when we headed to the lovely drury lane for a brunch part two.I would steer clear. even their coffee choices are small and apparently tastes just as mediocre - so not even worth a suggestion for a sit-down for a cuppa. wholly disappointing - and I'm not sure I've had my brunch plans so thwarted in a long time."

I've posted this review in HungryGoSomewhere and didn't get a response from the owner. Now with Yelp in Singapore, I need to continue to share my experience.They have a great location - I had no clue where ""The Foothills"" even was? A friend told me that it was near Liang Court but across the street...where? The cafe is super cute. No boring mall location here. It's tucked away in a side of Fort Canning Park. Ample, comfortable seating. Cute decor - doesn't look Ikea to me. Oh and their cakes are super attractive looking. If you wanted a beautiful cake for a kids party, adult tea gig, heck, probably even a wedding, this is the place to come (notice that said pretty...which doesn't mean delicious or tasty). That's about where the compliments end.I had this cake a friend's birthday party and it was decorated like Cookie Monster. There was even a cookie hanging out of the side of Cookie Monster's face. Looked like a winner to me (remember, I said beautiful cake?). We cut it up and passed around sliced. The icing, I think, was a buttercream that tasted only of butter and maybe a teaspoon of sugar. The best way to describe it would be to imagine mixing a can of Crisco and four sticks of butter together. Now add two teaspoons of sugar. Drown in Smuft blue food coloring. That's the icing.On to the cake. The one we had was a salted caramel chocolate. Cake was tasteless and dry. I appreciated that it came in three layers with caramel in between, which that was nicely flavored. But the caramel wasn't enough to carry the weak, dry cake, along with lardy icing.Even after this bad experience that left everyone's teeth a bright blue, I wanted to give it another shot for a baby shower I was hosting. The cake's presentation was super attractive - I can't fault it for that. Really, it's an impressive looking cake.The following day, I went to the outlet on River Valley. I walked inside of the restaurant and there were three employees there: two friendly women and a shortish man who I can only assume is the ""fabulous baker"", owner, or boss during the shift. I asked if I could buy a cake and was told that I needed to order three days in advance. Cool, that's fine. But then I started asking questions about the cakes in the fridge and none of the three associates wanted to help me. What flavor are these? No response. How many flavors do you have? No response. I'm not sure why these associates froze up or acted awkwardly to my questions.I still wanted a cake. I asked if the cakes in the fridge were spoken for. Again, I got stares. Blinks. I pointedly asked the ladies and they told me to ask the shortish man. He said that they weren't but were to be served in the restaurant, as guests ordered them, sliced. Then I asked that, hypothetically, what if I wanted to buy the ten or twelve slices that would consist of a cake, could he serve them to me. He said that I needed to order cakes three days in advance. Broken record? I heard you the first time, shortish man. In the end, he caved and said that if someone were to come in and ask for ten slices, he would have to sell them to that person.So then I asked for ten or twelve slices of the cake in the fridge that weren't spoken for. The ladies stared at me again and kept blinking. I pressed the question again and they pointed to the shortish man. The shortish man just said he couldn't sell me the cake. I walked to the door and asked again if they were sure that they didn't want to sell me the slices and that I would tell my friends and blog about it; this was their last chance to remedy the bad experience I'd had. The shortish man said that no, he was not going to sell me the slices.All in all. Great looking cake that tasted sub-par. And horrible service. In Singapore, there are so many great bakeries now. PV Plain Vanilla serves a kick butt cupcake in Holland Village, OKB on Kampong Bahru has the best brownie I've probably had in my life, and then you even have Twelve Cupcakes that has recipes for the ""Asian palette"". Against these folks, it's going to be stiff competition for Fabulous Baker Boy."

Fall in love almost immediately with the layout and quirky furnishing. It's a great place to mingle and events.2. The pie was awesome. Had a house pie and I must say I am so bringing people to have this the next time. Of course, while I try something else. but I guess it's the thing with fresh pies, it took a little longer than I expected to get it served on my table.3. The staff there was awesome. Didn't get to meet the baker boy himself but the coffee boy Haryanto did chat a lil with me. I love staff who will chat a lil and tell us a lil more. And guess what, they don't even charge us for that. (You will get the joke when you get there.)4. Although you might miss the place the 1st few times you pass by but you will never miss it again if you visited it once. It's actually right opposite Liang Court which means all you have to do is take the MRT to Clarke Quay and cross the road. Simple right? 5. If the place, the service, price and the food is right, why only 4/5? You didn't ask but I'm saying anyway. It's a shame that they only have 1 beer type and 1 cider at this place, when asked, Haryanto mentioned that they have issues with keep a big amount of stock there. tsk tsk. What a shame. Overall, I think everyone should at least visit the place once. Cause that is all it takes to get you there again. If you are a fan of ""The Pigeon Hole"" you will definitely like this place. Of course, ""TPH"" sells a lot more type of drinks."

(i.e. the opld river valley swimming complex) thanks to google i manage to figure it out~ambiance wise~ i would say its more like a tuck shop (i.e toa payoh swimming pool's tuckshop) there is a choice between indoors and outdoors. Even thou we choose indoors it was still rather humid/hot, and i was like sweating while i was indoors. Outdoor wise i would say even if they had fans they weren't as powerful to cool someone down. I was there around 2 - 4pm. ~Service wise~ its abit haphazard, in the sense that going there first they tell you to get a seat, then after they tell you to order at the counter. (most people would expect you to give them a menu if asked to take a seat?). Menu wise rather unprofessional, i mean having a menu printed out and pinned on a board shows the lack of professionalism. i would rather they have wrote it on a black board then printed on paper making it seems so not serious about their food.~Price wise~for the same price i think i rather go to TCC/coffee club or some restaurant  in liang court. It's probbly going to be a try once never go again (unless someone else is paying....) ~Table wise~ try to avoid the indoors the table is too narrow. My other qualms about the service, Water. basically each table was given water, but maybe cos they lack organisation or were really busy water came to us much later in the meal. (If i didn;t have my own bottle of water i probably would have choke, thou i must say its illogical that the water for 3 people came after the tea i ordered, what happened was a mix of chaos  and lack of a proper system) I witness some other table's order missing a sausage and stuff (food processing wise i would say they really lack organisation, i mean they asked if we wanted our cake with the food (again what kinda question is this??) and we opted to have it after the food, and they forgot about it, since they processed the first part and threw away the order chit, so when it came to our cakes we have to tell them and get the excuse that they forgot... *sighs*)~Food Wise~The only thing they had going for them was the food, i had egg Benedict, it was really tasty but proportion wise i would preferred if their cakes were a bit smaller. I would not recommend going for 2 course (I can really eat, but having both the egg Benedict and the carrot cake really made me skipped dinner)~Cake wise~ i had the chance to try 3 of them. their famous red velvet, their carrot cake and their lemon vanilla rasberry. i would say i found their carrot the best, some how the previous reviews had stated their red velvet was nice but i found both the red velvet and Lemon vanilla a tad too dry.  Overall i would say its a nice place to go in the evening for tea (after 5 perhaps?) but they fact that when they got busy it shows their lack of a system in place to deal with the orders and the amount of people reflects that there is a lack of organisation.this place needs a lot of improvements for it to succeed in the long run."

The avocado chunks were literally black in half the cases - not just lightly oxidised but thoroughly black throughout - no self respecting chef would have served that. The hummus lacked salt. The $10 grapefruit juice they call a ""no-tail"" was not really worth it. The cocktails looked better. We walked on to Common Man to top up the calories despite spending over $100++, rather than try the desserts.I recognised a few people from the hip crowd (including a Vogue cover). For some reason this place is ""cool"" right now, perhaps the great interior which beats the usual drab school chairs and tables with raw concrete, perhaps the fans which make the heat bearable, perhaps the lack of options nearby.

From there, service was fast and friendly enough. Star.

The brioche bread itself was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, which is exactly what you want, but it had absolutely no flavor, there was virtually no syrup, and it didn't get a lot of help from what were weak raspberries and very flavorless tiny little blueberries (if that's what they were).

Hubby ordered the eggs Benedict (which looked awesome!) and came with a side salad. I had entree envy. Was mine Paleo? Sort of. I needed to skip the cheese and bread, which left me with a whole lot of protein. We asked about a side of fruit, but unfortunately, they didn't have it and our server offered dessert instead. Not an ideal substitute, but they sure sounded good!Our service was wonderful and our server was very sweet.

I love the vegetable pretty much every which way I can get it, but like this, tender and spiced with slightly charred florets, it's exactly the sort of thing I could eat forever.the meat dishes are pretty stellar, with the bhatti chicken and barra chops coming out the tandoor both tender and moist, with a gentle but sophisticated blend of spices. I'm not expert enough to wax lyrical about notes of cardamom and cumin and all - such a noob, eh? - but good indian food to me is when the spices harmonise and complement the meats, and it was done very nicely here.galouti kebabs is lamb minced 32 times to reach a fatty, homogenous, pate-reminiscent texture. I don't take lamb, but my friends whacked quite a few on their own. I think it was quite rich, so make sure you know what you're in for.and an indian meal just isn't complete without a curry or daal, especially when you have delicious naan to sop it up with. our coriander chicken and prawn masala were a dryer style of curry, with tasty thick (rather than soup-like) gravies that clung to our porous naans. we were pretty stuffed at this stage, but that peshawari naan was too delicious.desserts followed: orange rasmalai were loose curds of cottage cheese flavored with rosewater and orange, the kulfi medley a plate of refreshing semi-freddo type malai and kesar pista kulfi, and a utterly and completely delicious bowl of mango phirni.I'm no connoisseur, so it may tell you more (than it tells me) that the cuisine here is pased on punjab-style cooking. our lovely host was very enthusiastic about how they use lots of butter for flavor, instead of the more traditional ghee, and while I can't explicitly taste any of that dairy fat - just be aware that it ain't diet food.just to finish: my must-orders are the tandoori broccoli, that bhatti chicken and the peshawari naan, all wiped up with that mango phirni."

The chicken shawarma was big and filling, as well as the big order of fries that came with the combo, but the taste itself was just so-so. It lacked some flavor, in my opinion. Although we were asked to choose the sauces to come with our shawarma (we went with the garlic sauce and chili sauce) so maybe it's partly on us. Will try to be more adventurous with the sauce choice next time."

I definitely like this version than the one at Pita Pan.If you do ask for it to go, eat it soon as it can get a bit soggy after a while.

Good job for them! Okay let me sit down first to specifically write down this review to warn you all although it almost rains and I got to run to santouka to wash out the after taste of the food just now. I ordered the supposedly 'premium' lamb kebab for 10.50$ which became 11.50$ for an additional topping of cheese that was supposed to make my experience more than delicious right? Wrong! It was a fiesta of soggy wrap and tendons of lambs! It has been a while since I feel completely ripped off. The lamb (tendons) might as well be used to create a brand new car tyres. So what else left for kebab to be desired when the wrap and the meat are fucked up? Nothing apparently but an urge to be done with it (since I pay 11.50 freaking bucks for it) and an oath to never glance at this place again (and refrain not to swear). I bet there are better kebab places in Singapore. For now I will keep yearning for a real kebab experience in New York.

In the middle of the meal, the lady manager came to scan our groupon. I found it a bit strange but didn't ask. But when we wanted to add some dessert, we were told that we can no longer use another groupon, because she has already scanned.

That's what I was told by a foodie friend of mine and En has plenty of that. And ever since my first introduction to it, I've been finding myself back there! While the decor isn't really Japanese, the ambience is decidedly so, thanks to the boisterous chants of ""Kampai"" you'll undoubtedly here being said from time to time. Service is fairly decent, though they have a tendency to send the mains before the starters, but that's not really a problem I can't live with. One of the reasons why I keep going back is for the quality of the food and the seasonal offerings that they'll have almost every other week. Since my introduction, I've had the chance to try almost everything on the menu, and my perennial favourites are their sashimi, beef carpaccio, garlic fried rice and kawa ebi. You might want to give their sushi's a miss seeing how much better the rest of the menu is."

There's the hard and chewy cinnamon churros at some movie theatres, there's also the greasy version with off-tasting chocolate dips at some spanish restaurants but there is NONE like the churros at Alegro's.This has got to be the best churros in Singapore right now. It's an unsuspecting little booth in clarke quay - it sells Spanish finger food and cocktails (or mocktails if you're partying responsibly) at very reasonable prices for the location. But I'd always come here to satisfy my churro cravings. You can order either the mini churros or the regular large chunky ones. They are sprinkled with sugar and come with addictive chocolate dip. Served hot and crispy, until you take a chocolate-dipped bite, you'll meet the soft buttery dough that's inside.Final verdict: Forget the clubbing, I could dig into the churros all night!"

The sweet chilli sauce was left untouched at the side after a try.We also shared the Hula Hawaiian Pizza which was sort of a guilty pleasure as it was sinfully oily with a thick, crispy crust. There was a mild spiciness usually lacking in other hawaiian pizzas and I can only assumed they added chilli flakes or powder to the pizza, but thankfully, it kind of works.The oiliness of the pizza and the thick crust fills one up and the two of us were left too full to try any thing else besides the 2 dishes. Service, though friendly, was careless, with staff handing me the change meant for another table before I even paid and it took forever for me to get the bill. While I oddly enjoyed the pizza, I doubt Shakey's merits a return anytime soon.For more pictures and the full review please visit voraciousappetite.wordpr…"

I went with very little expectation, but I was pleasantly surprised.Damotory has both indoor and outdoor seats. If weather permits, you should really try sitting outside on the tatami (Korean style) seats, sipping your soju under starry night. The indoor seats also have a section of tatami as well as normal wooden bench. It mimics one of those humble Korean restaurant you would find in Seoul neighbourhood. Their side dishes were not interesting. There were only 4 banchan but I totally loved the kimchi. The cabbage was very well pickled yet still crunchy. Mind you, I actually finished 3 helpings by myself. We ordered a half-half pancake of kimchi+chives. The kimchi side is definitely better because the chives half tasted like plain dough. The pancake is a tad oily but it does make the pancake taste nicer.The highlight of the night was the spring onion beef roll. The sauce was sweet, the meat was tender and the spring onion makes the whole roll crunchy! It's not cheap, 3 beef rolls for $20 but it's really good!We also ordered a chicken and glass noodle stew platter (can't rmb the full name). It was tasty! The carrot and potato was cooked soft enough yet still preserve sweetness of the vege plus the tasty stew sauce. It comes with some rice cakes in it too. It's rare to find rice cakes cooked in a non-spicy sauce, it's delicious. The $40 chicken stew is quite a big portion, probably feed 2-3 people if you don't order anything else.To celebrate end of the week, we had 2 jars of makgueli. They serve their makgueli in my favourite Korean clay-jars. You can easily spot that almost every table order their makgueli, because it is GOOD.I would come back to try other dishes on the menu because they serve quite a lot of un-conventional Korean dishes which you may not find in other Korean restaurant in Sg."

After been bought over by a China company, it renamed Orto Park with a number of new restaurants in it. One of the restaurants is Long Jiang Chinos which offers seafood cuisine in Chinese style. There is both aircon and non aircon dine in area. The aircon area requires a minimum spending of $600, which I do not think the family will spend so much for a simple dinner together. So we end up in the non aircon area but under the shade. One can also choose dining in the non aircon area by the large pond, but it could be quite dark with poor lightling.Assorted Seafood, Fresh ""Huai Shan"", Old Sixties Golden Stock 海鲜准山六十年代金汤 ($24)The soup is rich and full of flavours with lots of seafood such as fish slices and prawns in it.Deep Fried Prawn, Salted Egg Yolk, Milk Crust ($20)I order this as I like anything salted egg yolk. However I could not taste any salted egg yolk in this dish. It looks like cereal prawns and kinda of reminding of a certain restaurant's Butter Pork Ribs. The juicy prawns are coated in a layer of white powder. Interesting.Steamed Sea Bass, Spring Onion Soy Sauce ($4.20/ 100grams)The fish is not very big at 800grams. Looks not bad but has lots of bones in it.""Teochew"" Style Braised Pork Belly, Crispy Shredded Yam ($16)Although the meat looks quite fatty but it has a melt in the mouth texture. Interesting having it with the crispy yam which adds texture to the otherwise soft dish.Wok Fried Fine Bean, Crispy Shredded Yam, ""Guangzhou"" style ($14)I have never eaten fried bean served in such a fancy way. Tastes crunchy and cripsy.Homemade Dancing Tofu ($14)It looks plain deep fried bean curd topped with white fungus and other vegetables. The bean curd is stuffed with a savoury minced meat mixture. The bean curd is quite smooth too.Avocado Purée, Gula Melaka Ice Cream ($8)It is rich and not too sweet for a dessert. I feel that the gula melaka ice cream is a bit too light and overwhelmed by the avocado's taste.Almond Chocolate Glutinous Rice Ball, Adzuki Bean ""Feng Ge"" Soup ($5)It looks normal except that the rice ball is stuffed with chocolate which I do not quite take to it.Durian Pengat filled Bamboo Charcoal Cup ($9)It is actually durian puree served in crispy pastry cups. Interesting concept, but cannot taste the charcoal taste in the cup.Poached Baby Pear, Aloe Vera Osmanthus Jello ($6)The jelly is refreshing and light to end a meal with.Overall the food is not bad. Service is quite good too, with the staff giving us good recommendation. At first we plan to order other desserts after the meal, but after being after certain desserts take at least 15 minutes to be made. So we end up ordering the above. The place is not crowded although we are dining during weekend. Remember to keep the receipt from the restaurant to redeem for free parking if you drive to the restaurant."

Situated right beside the pond, Long Jiang Chinos brings exquisite and hearty seafood dishes in the surroundings of lush greenery.Established in 2014, the restaurant is an establishment by Long Jiang Culinary, which has years of experience in the culinary industryAs it is currently mid-autumn seasion, do check out their mooncakes available for sale in Takashimaya, NEX, Tampines Mall, Vivocity, Lot1 and Junction 8. Or just head down to Long Jiang Chinos at ORTO to enjoy some delightful Chinese cuisine with your mooncakes!This classic and timeless Teochew traditional mooncake is extremely crispy on the edges with melt in your mouth textured yam paste. These are some of the biggest Teochew mooncakes I've ever seen! The single yolk version gives the sweet yam a good mix of pleasure and premium taste. All these ""orh nee"" yam paste mooncakes are low in sugar. So you can savour without the fear of overdosing on calories from sugar.1. Seafood Hotpot $128++When visiting Long Jiang Chinos, be sure not to miss out on its most heart warming dish - Seafood Hotpot ($128). Curated specially by the chef with observance to the different preferences of a family, this dish was born to suit the likings of all ages within a family. Since then, the high raved Seafood Hotpot has since become a signature dish of the restaurant.Using only premium selection of fish, whole Soon Hock is simmered slowly under a bed of cabbage, ensuring that the fish will not be overcooked while you savour the soupy goodness of the hotpot. Consisting of an assortment of live prawns, clams and squid, these catch of the seas come together to make the ultimate hearty Seafood Hotpot.The chicken broth was so flavourful and really addictive and the broth is refillable! So don't be afraid to drink up as much as you like!2. Cheesy Crab Bee Hoon with Crab Roe $44.80++Long Jiang Chino's Cheesy Crab Bee Hoon with Crab Roe ($44.80) is rich, yet not overpowering on the senses. Bee hoon is first specially prepared by the chefs. A homemade stock is reduced and slices of cheese are added. Speak about infusing oriental cuisine with the west! The dish is completed with two whole Indian mud crabs atop. Overturn the shell of the crab and generous, crab roe is unravelled. 3. Crispy Fried Har Chou (8pcs) $12++Start your meal right with these crispy and delicious Har Chou! Filled with generous ingredients and really freshly fried!4. Fish Skin with Salted Egg Yolk $8.80++One interesting thing to note about this dish here is, unlike most eateries that serve the fried fish skin with a salted egg sauce, that turns the skin soggy after awhile. At Long Jiang Chinos, they use real salted egg but fried up!5. Stir Fried Fine Beans & Crispy Shredded Yam in Guangzhou Style $14++Crunchy green beans and flavorful crispy shredded yam makes this a tasty side dish. Best eaten with lots of rice.6. Rojak Chicken $16++Succulent chicken cutlet seasoned in sweet rojak sauce. This was delightfully appetizing and was a great meal-starter.Overall : The food at Long Jiang Chinos exceeds all my expectations. The seafood hotpot is a worthy cause to travel up north to Yishun. With an ample and airy ambience, it's a great chill-out spot for families and even business meetings. You can even get a VIP room with a minimum spending of $600. Don't forget to try their mooncakes too!"

It's really a good place to have a nice and quiet meal in contrast to the noisy restaurants that we find every where. Perhaps it's because this place is found in a quiet corner of Singapore in the first place?Anyway, we started off with a vegetable egg soup, which was nice but also rather filling. We next had the herbal chicken, which we found to be really tender and tasty. Another dish that we ordered was the sliced fish, which came with a sweetened sambal sauce. This one was quite average but we liked the freshness of the fish. We had fried rice which was really fragrant, and both of us had 2 bowls each.Our dessert was a mango pudding, which was chilled and sweet.All in all, we had a really good lunch here and I would highly recommend this place."

The worst of all is probably the mango pomelo, they slapped a price of $5.50 with only a portion big enough to feed a baby; the taste is plain, no sweetness to it nor any bitterness. I spent a total of $36 for basically a set of plain tasting xiao long baos, toy-ish siew mais, decent-but-not-worth-the-price steamed pork and chicken claws, plain mango pomelo, average HK milk tea and a bottle of distilled water.

This also included free flow of soft drinks, soft serve and condiments at the counter. For the group of 3 of us, we shared a yuan yang hotpot with a selection of Herbal Chicken Soup and Boiled Fish with Sichuan Pickles Soup (With a topup of S$6+). At first glance, it seemed like mostly vegetables such as assorted mushrooms (shiitake, abalone, Enoki), and green leafy vegetables (Tang O, cabbage, spinach), bean curd (firm and soft version), corn, and tomato. As we were sitting at the far end of the belt, most of the meat were taken by the time it reached our side. The staffs were helpful to bring big trays of sliced meat such as beef, mutton, and pork from the kitchen without us requesting for it. The Boiled Fish with Sichuan Pickles Soup was value for money as it was packed with slices of fish and preserved vegetables in it.Being newly opened there was no GST, but there was a 10% service charge on the bill.

By the time we're back and asked again regarding our seats and how long more we should wait. Staff #2 now tell us that they would give us the next available seat once it's available. Another 5 mins passed and a table opened up, and they happily decide to seat customers that arrived later than us at the table first. And their reasoning is that the table is for a 4pax and we have to wait for a 2pax table. And they can't even give us an estimated waiting time which makes no sense since it's a timed buffet. Staff #2 even suggested we go into their shop and eat some fries while waiting.

Well, it was salty and not spicy in this case.Perhaps, not an good idea using conveyor belt for buffet esp dinner. Those sitting near to the kitchen will grab most of the dishes before it can reach customers sitting far back. We saw the staff reusing the plates (from conveyor belts) without washing (his boss did) and plate the pork/beef/veg etc and back to the belt again. Food contamination probably didn't come across his mind :PFloor was slippery so those sitting near to the kitchen, be extra careful esp when the staff holding pot of hot soup!Next, xiao long bao were served at the buffet counter (besides water melon, that was the only dish on the counter). And guess what, the pork filing inside was RAW! I checked with the staff and confirmed that the dish should serve cooked! Luckily I saw it before eating, and inform the staff immediately. They merely retrieved the uncooked dish from the counter without making sure no one still eating it. I was the one who went over to few tables to stop people from consuming. No word from the boss or staff!Overall, the dinner was expensive and taste was mediocre. Paper thin (and 2-3pcs/plate) slice of meat, few 1 prawn/plate, few leaves of veg/plate etc. Will we be back, Hell No!"

I was introduced to this spot by family ages ago while I was but a pup and re-introduced by a close friend when I first got back to Singapore. It was instant reunification like long lost friends that led me to visit at least once a week to get my chicken rice fix in the northern part of Singapore.But what makes this particular stall stand out among the endless chicken rice stalls available in Singapore?The chicken; definitely the chicken - sauced right, cooked right, tender...and not-so-oily. Since I usually order extra chicken or the half chicken, it always comes out on a plate that looks like chicken resting within a swimming pool of sauces. Oh, they even garnish it with a slice of tomato (lol), peeled cucumbers (as usual), and *pickled* cucumbers. Yet, it is only taste that really matters and that is something they definitely succeeded in.As for the rest?The rice, chili, and soup...are just slightly better than the typical chicken rice stall.

I can take it or leave it. I have never crave for it or dream about it. To me, chicken rice is like fast food. It is something which is easy to order as take-away. No soup, no mess. Just sliced chicken over a mound of rice and maybe some cucumber slices with a small packet of chili sauce. My colleague who lives in Yishun told me there is nothing much in Yishun and recommended two food stalls to try when he found out I will be heading this way. This is one of them. It does seem strange to refer to Yishun as if it is in a far away place when it is probably about a 30 minutes drive away (but if you take public transportation of bus/train, it can get to 1-2 hours, depending on where you come from). I found this place, which is actually very near the bus terminal. It occupies a corner stall in the coffee shop and is very well managed. There is a queue system. Order at the cash register, get your receipt on which your queue number is printed. Wait for your queue number to be called. Collect your food when called. It has many recommendations on its signboard by various TV shows. Now I am a bit skeptical about such claims after the Tiong Bahru market experience. But this place does serve pretty good chicken rice. I ordered the $3.50 portion to go. Since it is Hainanese chicken rice, only ""white"" chicken is available, no roasted version. The packet of chicken rice was very hot, piping hot. It was the first time or since a very long time I had such a packet where the food was actually hot. It was still warm when I got to it like 3-4 hours later. The chicken was not silky smooth or succulent as I would like, I put it down as maybe I left it for too long, but it was not totally dried out or tough. It was still soft but with more bite to the meat. The rice was amazing. Oh my goodness, they drizzled sauce over the chicken and rice and after the 3-4 hours, the rice just soaked up the flavor. I could literally just eat the chicken rice as is, without the chili or dark soya sauce at all. It was that delicious. It also came with a few slices of pickled cucumbers or something, adding a bit of crunch to it. I would order this again when I am in the Yishun area."

Among friends, we simply refer to it as ""925"". Now, I'm no foodie, but everything here tastes good. Good enough to stave off hunger, and good enough to satisfy a man's enormous appetite. But this is a review of the Hainanese Chicken Rice stall at 925 Coffeeshop.I've dined and ordered my fair share of chicken rice here over the years and it still tastes as good now as it did back then. The price has increased over the years, but still remains affordable. $3.50 for a packet of piping hot, succulent and mouth-watering slices of boneless white chicken served with fragrant rice, pickles, pineapples, a slice of tomato and ""Yan Xu"". I think the vegetables are Yan Xu(s).Whether in a large group, or dining alone, the stall serves enough for any occasion. I've heard of other places touting mouth-watering, gravity defying chicken rice at least 5 times the cost of a plate here, but this is a stall that serves up a mean dish of Hainanese chicken rice.On any day, and any time, make your way down to the coffeeshop and you will see customers tucking into plates of chicken rice. If I were to exaggerate, I'd say that half the coffeeshop is filled with eager mouths chomping down on chicken going by the pastel purple plates that never stop filling tables.If you've not tried the stall before, try it once and you may very well be a convert. It is, after all, a simple plate of chicken rice. But, there could very well be more than meets the eye, and mouth, and taste buds too."

Based on her experience, we called to make reservation first even though it's a week day and that was such a brilliant move! When we reached around 8pm, the restaurant was packed! and there were more than 10 people in the queue outside the restaurant. Even under the circumstance where we've made reservation, we had to wait for around 10 minutes for the table. The decoration of the place was very classy and they have individual pods which allows for a little bit more privacy. We had sashimi (salmon, salmon belly and tuna). Presentation of the food was elegant. The sashimi was served in a bowl with dry ice. Needless to say, the sashimi was very fresh. Besides that, we also had soft shell crab tempura, which decent but not anything special. We ordered also the really unhealthy deep fried chicken skin, which we did not finish as it really tasted quite bad. However, that was the only dish that we didn't like. The waiters were not really attentive nor patient as the restaurant was really packed out. It would make our dining experience a better one if they can improve on their customer service."

It was thoughtful of them to prepare seats outside for customers who are waiting. Overall, the food was great! However, there was an unpleasant miscommunication with the staff. After ordering the first round of food, we figured it wouldn't be enough as we were still hungry for more! We were rather indecisive in what we wanted, but we have finally decided on another portion of salmon sashimi, grilled bacon roll and fried chicken skin. The waitress, though confirming that we were adding three more dishes, actually put in the fourth item. When the grilled enoki mushroom that we didn't order was served, we clarified that we did not order that dish and the waitress did not take it very well."

The entire coffee shop operates in the afternoon selling a variety of food, including herbal soups and lunch sets catered to the office and industrial crowd. By night, Xian Seafood Village is transformed into a full fledged seafood eatery.Xian Seafood Village prides itself in serving fresh seafood, as showcased with their numerous fish tanks of live sea animals. The owners have had experience in the fishing industry as well as F&B, hence they Really know their stuff in regards to fresh seafood.(1) Tasty Lady's Finger $10.00 (sml)The lady's finger was indeed tasty. Do not let this simple dish fool you, some might wonder, why is such a simple dish showcased?! Because it's really tasty! The texture of the lady's finger is just right, chewy, soft and yet oozing with veggie juicy goodness. Instead of ordering your typical fried kang kong, try this instead!(2) Flower Crab Trio Seafood Bee Hoon $25.00 (med)At a seafood zi char eatery, a special must order is their crab bee hoon. Few are able to execute this right. Flower crabs are usually chosen as it is able to bring a level of sweetness to the dish. However, the beehoon and the broth here didn't quite pick up the tinge of sweetness or flavour from the flower crab that I had expected. Xian Seafood Village is indeed generous with their ingredients in this dish of seafood bee hoon. I would say this is more than enough for 4 pax.(3) Specialty Braised Meat $15.00 (sml)Instead of sweet and sour pork, get this! A delicious meaty dish served with a layer of fats, aka the three layered meat. The pork was tender and you could taste the positive end results from the braising process.(5) Hong Kong Style Steamed Shark Lips $35.00 onwards (sml) About 600gmSo, this is a very interesting dish, labelled as Shark Lips, but the owner shared that this is actually lips of a Sturgeon. Which after some research shows that it is a label for some 27 species of fresh water fish. That may or may not be endangered. This really begs the question, since everyone is so afraid of eating sharks, thinking it's not environmentally friendly, how much ""better"" is it for the environment, if we eat another type of fish as a delicacy? But in all honesty, sturgeons do look alot like sharks.|(6) Fragrant Garlic Pork $10.00 (sml)The sliced pork all curled up nicely when fried and I half expected a crispy, crunchy texture. But alas, it was not. It was rather tough but it carried an aromatic fragrance that was pretty appetizing.(9) Cheese Baked Seafood Platter $138 onwards- Lobster, Jumbo Crab, Prawns, Fan shell scallops & LaLa.A feast fit for a king. This dish definitely showcases Xian Seafood Village's capability to serve up a wide range of fresh seafood in a newer style of cooking catered to the younger palate. The crab here was very fresh and it absorbed the cheese sauce rather well. The cheese sauce is thick and gooey! But it was again, more buttery and milky than it was cheesey. It wasn't gerlat at all, while digging into this dish.(11) Soft shell crabs $25.00 ($5.00/pc) *highly recommended*I am SO COMING BACK FOR MORE OF THIS! Crispy, freshly fried soft shell crabs that just go CRUNCH CRUNCH! in your pre-molar and molars! The batter isn't too think such that you find it dripping in oil.You can actually taste the crab meat that is beneath the fried soft shell crab.  This is probably what I would think is their stand-out signature dish, quite unseen anywhere and this is where other seafood zi char have yet to offer.Overall : Amidst the hype about cafes and ice cream dessert spots, Zi Char is something that never dies out. While the influx of online novelty cheese creations, Xian Seafood Village manages to tie it with their fresh seafood offerings. The location is okay to get to via private transport, it's airy and well-cooled. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful as well. Definitely try their fried soft-shell crab!"

Even though we had a reservation for 8 we had to pester them to see if we could have the open tables.2. After ordering we waited for at least an hour and 15 mins (plus after multiple complaints), before we actually got our first dish and rice.3. My grandmother was so hungry she actually finished a whole bowl of rice when the first dish came and we had to wait at least another 15 mins before the other dishes started to come.4. The food wasn't even worth the wait. There were a few redeeming factors like the 鱼头汤 and soft shell crab, but everything else didn't taste good. The sambal kang kong had no sambal taste. The sauce in the broccoli with scallops was tasteless so it just tasted like plain boiled broccoli. The fragrant garlic pork was easily the worst dish of the night.5. By the time we were done eating, we were pretty much the last table to leave (around 10:40), and all they did was say 不好意思. We were NOT the last table to be seated.To be fair, the prices are reasonable but the service was ridiculous. Please don't come here and ruin your own day. Will definitely NOT recommend to anyone."

Throughout the years the taste quality of the food has stayed the same. That's a good thing; I only come to SG about once a year and I like that I can depend on a place to maintain the same quality of food I had a year ago. However, I am dismayed with how the prices have increased. If you're going to begin charging more, than maybe amp up the quality, or at least the portion sizes. Will it hurt to serve a little more extra rice? My go-to order is the chicken curry and I am never able to properly finish with enough rice to curry ratio. This was fine back when the food was cheap. But this whole meal was nearly  SG$17 and I hardly got any satisfaction out of it. The hawker centers provide better food for way less. Only reason this place gets a 4 star rating is because I love how Toast Box has convenienced me in the past with their location and static menu item. I've also had fond memories of coming here with my mother, so the high rating is also for sentiment."

We decided to give it a try. Came around 1pm, looked around, decided to go sit inside to order. It seemed like a few big groups had recently left (empty dirty tables), so the staff was running around to clean up. Understood.We sat there a good 10mins before we flagged someone to take our order (we made up our minds thanks to the photos on yelp because nobody even acknowledged us until that point). The guy stops, we order 1 thing and are about to order something else when he looks up and start talking to someone else and just leaves our table.Later as he passes by again, we look at him expectantly and he just laughs at us while going on with his life. Another 5mins and we ended up leaving since still no acknowledgement of us was done.Maybe they have great food, maybe not. We sure didn't get a chance to try.Terrible experience."

One could not help but suspect that the kitchen staff cooked this dish in bulk, as every table was served this dish at the same time. It was served with sweet sauce. While coating in a light and crispy batter crust, the inside was more like fish cake, as it was minced too finely and packed with too much flour, lacking of crunchy texture and natural sweetness of crunchy shrimps, and crunchy water chestnut.Interestingly the staff served each table with mentos as mouth refresher after the meal, which was uncommon for chinese restaurants. As the restaurant was still new, be prepared to wait quite awhile for the dishes to be served."

Despite being frazzled and hauling the last few ""donations"" of accumulated material wealth to those who had first dibs, I still tried to remember if there was anything in the bucket list that I *needed* to get done before I flew out.I was 100% sure I forgot something - that the list was incomplete. Yet, as much as I searched within, I came up empty. Thankfully, one of the cousins brought me to the light.FROG LEGS. Holy freaking toddler. I forgot about FROG LEGS. Scramble the jets, we've got a national emergency. Where can I get decent frog leg porridge in the area? A barrage of text messages and phone calls later, I found myself back in Yishun 925 yet again - and not for Hainanese Chicken Rice!All opinions received pointed out the same thing: Frog Leg Porridge here is as good as the famous spot in Geylang.While I obviously never tried the one in Geylang (nor any other spot that is), the ""Kung Pao Frog Legs"" here was beastly awesome. So freaking awesome that it justified the binge.About $30 for 3 legs and a large bowl of porridge left me half dead from a combination of the chili-heat and the intense humidity of this particular food court (mixed with the infamous Singapore heat) BUT completely satisfied that I just dodged another culinary heresy.For the record, anyone who claims that frog legs taste like chicken...should never be a food critic. It tastes better than chicken. Definitely, tastes WAY BETTER than chicken. If anything, it tastes more like $$$ grouper $$$ cheeks - absolutely IMMACULATE.Yelp 100: 59/100 (yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm behind...I'll catch up soon...)/My-last-3-weeks-in-SG"

If you're a student, check out the student specials page on the menu. Main course is around $7.90. But seriously, they've got to buck up on their speed.

I was offered a menu and made some quick orders concerning rolls of seaweed over sticky rice stuffed with tuna, crab meat, roe and other seafood delicacies. As I waited for my meal to come, I saw other customers made somewhat similar orders. The place is littered with white tables and brown chairs where customers sat comfortably while eating the sushi dish of their choice. There was an unmistakable aroma of seaweed and seafood lingering in the air that made my empty tummy rumbled with anticipation. As time progressed, my mouth watered until my food was served before me. The sushi lot on my plate looked enticing enough to be eaten, which I made my first bite on one of them. My eyes rolled up with ecstasy as the sushi freshness engulfed me starting from my mouth outwards. The superb taste simply overwhelmed me till I had to pause in collecting myself. As the last trail of sushi slid down my throat deep within me, I looked on at the rest of the sushi lot and devoured like a crazed lion. A series of blissful feeling surrounded me after every bite till I shuddered at the end of my meal.

I have walked past enough Manhattan Fish Markets to smell the wafts of singed shrimp or fried goodies in their typical open layout...BUT never heard the luring call of mythical sirens in the distance trying to seduce me in.That changed when I visited a friend in Yishun who insisted that we eat some place in Northpoint to catch up. We found that most establishments were packed like sardines in olive oil with lines longer than a crazy 2 year old can ever draw. So as we walked around, I kept insisting on hitting up the famous chicken rice spot nearby...but was repeatedly turned down. (""Chicken rice? Come on, you can have that any other given day..."")So we pranced around the tiled floors until we landed at the first establishment without a line. MFM with no lines and two vacant tables was more than glad to pull us in for a meal. Our friendly server sat us down and handed us menus to peruse until we both arrived at a decision to what our hungry selves would gorge upon while we initiate protocol ""heavy data synchronization via conversation"". (Btw, sure enough, a few minutes later, there was a line of more than 8 people outside; talk about perfect TIMING).Moi - Salade et Poisson (crispy whole barramundi); & Citrus Mint drinkCollègue - Soupe et Poisson (grilled cod); & Rootbeer float*******We can't say we love this place; however, we can admit to having paid a decent amount for seating space to have a conversation in an atmosphere better than Starbucks. As for the food, 1. Grilled cod was such a tiny but well-presented dish. The flavors were intact - albeit nothing mind blowing - and fun to look at. I was even betting that it took significantly more work on the line cook's part to get the presentation right compared to my dish.2. Grilled barramundi is definitely great for those who want to achieve the maximum bang for the little buck in establishments such as this. There was so much fish to consume over plain boring slightly seasoned rice that just trumped my friend's dish...but flavorwise...boring, lacking, and needing more ""spice"" to it. (If I had brought my little secret spice box, I could have fixed it in an instant and made it immaculate on the spot...)3. Salad - it is what it is....but was given the weirdest question when they brought our main dishes to us before anything else - including drinks. ""Oh, you want your salad now?"" (I'm sorry madame, when was I supposed to get the salade? Tomorrow?)4. Citrus Mint - perfect base for a couple shots of rum or vodka or tequila. Okay, I shouldn't think along those lines...but I was just seeing...potential.An interesting place...but not one I'd recommend to anyone looking for great food. But my friend did enjoy the place and the dishes - as well as the atmosphere and the fact that we could catch up after a significantly LONG time apart. I guess...that's what matters when you end up visiting the McDonald's equivalent of seafood joints.Au'revoir. Bon appétit.Yelp 100: 3/100"

The chicken was crisp and hot when I bit into them, and the meat beneath the skin was as juicy as ever. The fries were tasty as hell too, and the condiments were pretty good too.The only negative that Arnold's has is the price of the meals.

Had the whole spring chicken set (which does not come with soda or water of any sort) which cost about 12 bucks. Once you've tasted the chicken, the smell you endure is worth it. (I probably got used to it after sitting there for a while) the chicken is fried to perfection with a thin coating of batter-not too much, so you'd enjoy more meat than crumbs of batter unlike some fried chicken restaurants. Would recommend this to be shared between two hungry people. The spring chicken also comes with a tiny portion of coleslaw and some fries. The chicken is probably the reason I'd visit again. Would be wise to skip the sides imo if you're ordering a la carte. 5 stars for the chicken, minus half for the sides & the fact that their set does not come with drinks, and -1.5 stars for the stench."

The fishball noodle stall demonstrates some pretty inconsistent standards. Different people handle the cooking, depending on their shifts, so look for the one who is male; he whips up the most satisfactory bowl of noodles. The beef noodle stall cannot compare to ""The Hong House"" when it comes to the all-important gravy, but it is at least cheaper by a dollar or so.

The sandwich was a hot and tasty, happy about that. The chicken cutlet was on the small side, but that's the nature of ""real"" chicken, I guess, so I can't be that upset. It was very good, if only a little bigger would have been great. But the fries. The fries I have come to learn are a phenomenon all around Asia for being the best of any McDonald's in the world (I tried seven different restaurants today before McDonald's was my fallback, but at least the fries will be good!) and yet what I received were greasier than usual (fine), hot enough, but...old. Just clearly... old fries. How can that be? I got them with no salt, just to be double sure they would be fresh. But somehow, I got old, soggy, limp ass fries. So I paid the grab driver and tipped him for the speedy service (not his fault, eh?) and called the restaurant. It'll be a quick fix. It's only some fries and it's half a mile away. As expected, the McDonald's worker showed up maybe... ten minutes later? Super happy. We exchanged pleasantries and he went back to his bike. I came inside and opened my hot, aromatic bag of... more old crappy fries. I literally ran outside barefoot to stop him and am wasting time writing this stupid review because of how irritated it makes me to have this problem at all, let alone twice on the same order.

We happened to walk past this area and decided to give it a try. The outside had a very nice Japanese touch to it and the overall place looked rather inviting, so we decided to give it a try.The prices here seem to be quite affordable; slightly below typical restaurant prices. I ordered an omu (omelette) rice with chicken cutlet, and I found that the rice was quite nice. The egg was particularly delicious as it was fluffy and tasted very fresh. However, I felt that the chicken cutlet was somewhat too thin and lacked bite to it. It was also rather tasteless and I have certainly had better ones elsewhere.The curry sauce was pretty good though. I also liked the fact that the serving size was enough for me, a really big eater.Overall, a decent place to get your Japanese food fix."

Yes, it is present everywhere...be it out of necessity, out of fun, out of random rendezvous, out of boredom...out of whatever you name it...it simply exists.So I'm sure it eventually causes some to stop and question how it is even possible for TERRIBLE food to exist (not to mention, continue to thrive/survive in some cases) in such a foodie nation?Perhaps, after this particular pit-stop on my way to getting rid of half the accumulated junk, I have two possible answers:1. ""Out of comfort / convenience"" - this place isn't cheap when you make a direct comparison with hawker centres, food court / Kopitiams, or even other ""restaurants"" nearby. In fact, it's a lot more than the former and still higher than the some of the latter. But from the sheer number of people there...probably it's either the intensity of the heat or the fact that tables are so readily available that ""choping"" isn't even necessary.2. ""Out of indifference"" - I guess there are some people just don't give a crap anymore after a lifetime spent within a foodie nation. Carbs? Check. Salt? Check. Rice? Check. $8.50? Check. Table? Check. Chair? Oh yes, check. Kids? What kids? Check. Fudge it...I'm hungry.NOTE:All three dishes that I spontaneously ordered that day...were salty beyond the ""salty norms"".

The outlet ran out of whipped potato, so it was replaced with coleslaw. The mango peach was quite watered down in taste. The Parmesan Chicken was quite crispy outside with a hint of spicy taste, while juicy inside. The yellowish sauce looked quite cheesy but really had the truffle taste in it, although could not smell any of it.Overall felt that it better than the usual fried chicken being not so oily and more crispy too."

Sometimes in a rush, I have to throw most of the food away as I just simply have no time to eat. I hope that better lunch delivery time is meet and if not, I will never order from this caterer again"

The outlet was new and had an opening promotion that we couldn't resist. A meal for four at just $39.90! It included rice, two types of chicken dishes, vegetables, pie tee, drinks and bubor chacha for dessert. In we went and though it was a busy day, the staff and food didn't disappoint.The cafe was full, so understandably , we had to wait a while for the chefs to prepare our order. We shared two plates of butter and roasted chicken with our rice and veggies among the four of us. The chicken was tender and juicy and the rice cooked just right. That itself was already filling. Then the pie tee came. They're like popiah served in fried dough cups. For some reason, they weren't as good as the ones we had at their branch in Vivocity. The veggies were soggy and weren't fresh. The bubor chacha hit the right level of sweetness and included plenty of yam and sweet potato chunks. It filled our bellies well enough. Though the standard of the pie tees has fallen, we were satisfied with the meal and will be back on other promotions!"

I finished the bowl of noodles feeling clean/healthy (since there was not much flavour) even when drizzled with the starchy (tasteless) sauce it was served with. The signature minced pork ramen tasted ordinary, it's minced pork reminding us of the canned minced pork in chilli oil one would eat with porridge at home. Didn't try the medium spicy noodles but they were not spicy at all according to my eating partner. The xiao long baos were also nothing to shout about. The only difference between their original xlbs and the ones with scallop were the few strips of dried scallop in the scallop xlb. If you have to eat here and crave xlbs, just stick with the original. Overall, a rather ordinary (home cooked feeling) meal which did not justify the amount spent here. More could be done to differentiate their dishes from what could be done at home and attract a better crowd.Would give it 2.5 stars at best"

I attribute this to poor management training. The server should keep an eye on the customers that that arrived and are ready to order while going about their other lower priority tasks.

It's stern and firm but he's quite nice la. There may be a stream of customers but the helper is ready to bring the food to you. To the main highlight. As usual, I will taste the drumstick rice first. This stall's drumstick is tender and softer than most hawker stalls already and the rice is fragrant too. Once I add the chilli and dark sauce to the rice, the 'burst' is definitely there! What makes this stall stand out? It's the peanut chicken soup or some other soup of the day that comes with your chicken rice! The soup is tasty and filled with ingredients, unlike most stalls which serves plain soup.

Despite the fact that there was no one else waiting to play the staff wasted no time in letting us know that the game had to finish. Then they repeated this a couple of minutes later. Yes, I know it was $10 for one hour, but was it really good customer service to kick your customers off the table when there was no one else waiting to play.

The smoky ice cream was quite unique in taste. Overall the food was totally different from the usual Thai food. Only that the serving portion was kind of small.

However, I was sorely disappointed by it - the salmon fillet lacked any punch in its taste. While admittedly it does look fresh, the sous vide method of cooking it (according to my waitress, Yuko, they boil it at 40 degrees Celsius) means that it may be neither warm nor cold. Perhaps the sauce was used to give the salmon some form of flavour - but alas, this was done unsatisfactorily and left my friend and I wanting.

In between my dismayed sputtering, he decided to take pity on me and said he would give me a call if a table let up.And it (thankfully) did. Had a fantastic meal consisting of tasty fish cakes, crispy fish doused in spicy Thai sauce, alarmingly spicy Tom Yum Goong and rich green curry - all well-accompanied by fluffy jasmine rice. The only qualm I had with the food was that it was not quite warm enough. Food that isn't of the right temperature always makes me unfoundedly suspicious.Service definitely also deserves a mention - the staff were extremely attentive and took us very seriously when we asked for suggestions on our choice of dishes. They gave great recommendations based on just a couple of preferences highlighted.Will definitely be turning up at their door again - with a reservation made this time."

The local food was surprisingly good. Huge portions and priced around $10+. The laksa was highly recommended by my host (who was the member and boat owner in our group). I tried some and it was very rich and lemak! Some of our party had the champagne buffet..I must say it's the most affordable champagne buffet at 78+ (add another + if you're not a member as you have to pay 10% service charge). I had a taste of the gazpacho and loved it. My friends seemed to enjoy the seafood and desserts. The menu is western fusion, some touches of asian but not overtly so. And the buffet champers served freeflow was...Piper Heidsieck, so it was a reliable brand. Reliable and way better than cheap stuff. Generous when you factor in the price.I had a healthy fish bee hoon (huge portion), it was ok with clams. My friend let me try her fried kway teow with a raw egg yolk (I think it's called moon river?) and it was yummy.Another nice thing is they still allow ordering from the ala carte menu. In fact they let us order from the full ala carte menu (we were a big group of 15 or so) and not the shortlist that they had separately for Sunday. So you know how sometimes you have some in the group who insists to go for champagne brunch but you are not keen on eating a log and a house or want to save some money..you will do ok here.There was one difficulty, there was a live band playing on Sunday. It's not that they were bad but they played a mix of some old music at a very loud volume and it was really spoiling the relaxing summertime sunday mood rather than helping to create the chillax mood. So I suggest if the band is on, sit outside by the water. It will mean you have to walk further to the buffet line but that's a good thing. I love dining by the water so I give this 4 stars (although I couldn't that day as it was raining quite heavily).I asked and the staff was very certain when she said you can get a member friend to book for you and the member friend doesn't have to be present when you eat or pay. I haven't taken advantage of this yet but I think it's doable as I realise I know 3 members just off the cuff already. Plus...I have the Islander Pass. Otherwise entrance to the island is $7 per car on Sundays and $6 per cab!"

The taste is subtle yet without the addition of seasonings as you can really taste the flavours of the pork, Ikan billis etc. I would say that it is not cheap dining here, hence the 4*, but I'd rather favour quality over quantity. Verdict:- Porridge (fish and minced meat on two occasions) : Porridge is not just for when one is ill but can be a light meal any time of the day. Love the subtle taste of each ingredients and the subtle taste of sliced ginger. - Chinese cabbage with milk broth : Very well done cabbage; blanched without losing its crunchiness and coupled with the broth mixed with salted egg, it is simply divine!- Tofu : They offer a variety of tofu with different toppings. Try anyone. They are just as good!Tip: Good to go early to beat the dinner crowd which starts trickling in at around 6pm."

Very thankful to have this outlet so near my house, each time I want to have a vegetarian meal.I've been eating vegetarian meals at home and outside for a week since I've been back from Europe (no, not because I'm sick of meat, or anything weird!), but more because my mindset has changed due to conversations with some people and seeing things from a healthier perspective.I've visited this outlet 4 times in a week and each time I've ordered something different.Here's what I ordered:- Laksa - The soup is da bomb! Laksa is generally a vegetarian dish as there is no meat in there and what makes the dish is the flavourful and creamy soup! Add Greendot's famous sambal in, and the soup has a fantastic OOMPH flavour! This is always a favourite!- Herbal Noodle Soup - This is also another favourite of mine as the soup has an insanely good herbal taste with lots of goji berries floating (depending on which outlet you visit). If you want something extra nourishing and healthy but also want some soup noodle-y thing, try this!- Soya Noodles - This is my first time trying it only because I overheard the couple in front raving about it between themselves. I'm always a fan of soup noodles, however, this is a dry noodle dish. There is a big bowl of soup that comes with it though. What I love about this dish are the crunchy carrot/cucumber strips that blend in so well with every mouthful of flavourful noodles! Ask for more sauce for the noodles, if you like your noodle wetter.- The black pepper franks - I presume is a substitute for sausages but it is actually tofu made to look like a sausage. Eating it on its own is abit bland but dip it in a mix of chilli and tomato sauce (given by the waitress and a small dish to pour it in) is heavenly.What's more, each time I visit, I notice that the wait staff are always very cheerful and crack jokes with regulars and newbies alike, making the whole dining atmosphere very pleasant. Also noticed that they are mostly seniors, save for the cashier? Hmmmm.TIP:  The cashier won't actively ask you if you have their membership but they do! Go to Greendot's website to sign up and collect points by providing your number before you pay. Worth it if you eat here regularly or are a vegetarian."

The bean curd soaked up the soup easily.Steamed Live Seabass (ala carte $4.90++/100g (Seabass)Fresh fish steamed with garlic, black bean in soy sauce and chilli oil, then topped with a generous serving of chopped chillies for a savoury-spicy complement to the fish's natural sweetness.The fish was fresh and juicy.Steamed Prawns with Minced Garlic (ala carte $32.00++ (M))Succulent prawns lightly steamed and topped with savoury minced garlic.It was helpful that the prawns had been sliced into two, so that it would be easier to remove the meat from the shells.PUTIEN Sweet & Sour Pork with Lychees (ala carte $18.90++ (M))Deep fried to light golden brown, the meat is tender and moist on the inside. The lychee is a perfect complement with its added burst of sweetness to the sauce.Looked not bad, but the crust encasing the meat was lacking of crispiness. Stir-fried Green Dragon Vegetable with Garlic (ala carte $14.90++ (M))A healthy dose of emerald green vegetables infused with fragrance of garlic slices.I like that the dish was fried with lots of garlic slices, but the vegetable was lacking of crunchiness. Choice of 1 Main Course : Mazu Mee Sua (ala carte $26.80++ (L))Mee Sua, or literally, ""Long Noodles"", symbolizes longevity. PUTIEN Mee Sua is handmade using traditional methods and a recipe unique to Putian. Using premium quality flour, the pristine, white, thread-thin vermicelli doesn't turn soggy when cooked.The noodle was smooth and well braised with a strong alcoholic taste in the flavourful broth.Dessert of the Day : White Fungus with Gingko Nut and Red DateThe dessert was served hot and light in taste.Complimentary Fruit PlatterThe fruit served were fresh and juicy.Overall the food delicious and filling.

Since its opening in the millennium year, it has never fail to draw eager diners to the restaurants. Putien being the name, is a city in Fujian province in China. The Putianese also referred to Xinghua, speaks a min language and this group of dialect is not common in Singapore. However, its cuisine has been well-liked by many. I am intrigued.Stepping into the restaurant at Nex shopping mall, it was 70% filled with heartlanders. Despite the after lunch hours at 2.15pm, the flow of diners didn't stop yet I was able to get a table effortlessly. I was attracted to the clean and spacious setting, something which helps to ease my tension from the enormous afternoon heat. The table-to-table arrangement has been quite roomy and not elbow-knocking. I truly enjoyed the soothing therapeutic melody playing in the background while waiting for the dishes, it definitely cools you down even having to wait long, if need be.  I am no novice to Putien dishes, I snapped at my comfort food. The wait staff who took orders was prompt and attentive while another who managed the beverage, had been a little sluggish. Hence, I attribute the ""lag"" to individual working attitude than putting them down as a whole. I had premium Iron Goddess of Mercy, ""Tie Guan Yin"" for a refreshing taste buds to accompany my meals. The tea leaves comes in whole and the oolong fragrance was very strong. Every sip sparks me up and seems to get me ready for the dishes behind the kitchen. Truly stands above the rest and I get heartened every time the tea cup was refilled with hot boiling water.I did not opt for any starter and zoom right into the mains. I ordered the Fried Homemade Beancurd, Deep Fried Tenggiri Fish and the notorious Fried Heng Hwa Bee Hoon.   The fried homemade beancurd was delightful. It has a pronounced soybean aroma which enlivened by the sprinkled salt (resembled french fries but replacing the carbo-rich ingredient with a healthier version) . Each thinly sliced bean curd has been fried to crisp and the accompanied sweet-sour garlic dip flavors it further (it was as good on its own).   I'd always like my tenggiri fish to be fried thoroughly till golden brown. Yes, Putien's very home-cooked way which reminds me of my granny's version. The fish was fresh with the meat being moist. No traces of awful fishy taste in them which made me adored even more. No greasy after-taste was a plus factor.The most anticipated dish; Fried Heng Hwa Bee Hoon was the star of the meal. No mixed feelings on the translucent-looking vermicelli (aged rice milled by hand). I vouched for its refreshing taste and the to-die-for claims by many others who have tried. The texture of vermicelli was extremely chewy (not rubbery), unlike others who soiled the noodles, making it soggy & brittle. The rice noodle was thread-thin yet chewing has been made possible on each strands amazingly. You could taste the sweet broth (using pork, chicken bones) in the vermicelli, though it was fried dry. The seafood heightened the flavour of the dish. The clams, prawns, scallops enhanced the taste, making it more refreshing while the roasted peanuts, fried shallots (with garlic bits), crispy seaweeds contributed to the crunch. I have no doubt in my choice.To end the lunch, I asked for the dessert menu. Pumpkin cream with ice-cream & Sweet potato balls were picked among the 8 choices (by now, you should be aware that I am a big fan of pumpkin and sweet potato). The pumpkin paste was smooth and silky. It tasted fresh and home-made, definitely not a canned puree. Moderately sweetened by the accompanying scoop of coconut ice-cream, making it creamier. The pulut hitam (pudding-like black glutinous rice) was barely noticeable except for the grated peanuts. But the pumpkin would still taste pleasantly good without these. The sweet potato balls however, tasted inferior. More of a mochi treat. Previously it tasted real with sweet potato mash but now, the deep fried balls were coupled with more starch in the mash. I didn't like the chewy texture, I'd wanted a creamy & wholesome sweet potato mash balls instead. Not making it better, there was a greasy sick taste (soaked up too much oil), causing greater disappointment. Still, the pumpkin cream managed to salvage my almost-ruined sweet indulgence."

I have massive cravings for this fish.the meat dishes are pretty good home-cooking too. we finished the meal with a fruit platter and syruped loquats - I'm not one for syrupy things but the latter were very interesting.if you've skipped that long spew, then I really like this restaurant. honest cooking, good prices, decent portions and highly consistent standards even across outlets - and I have a soft spot for regional chinese cooking (much of what we have locally is more generally cantonese than anything else).p.s. other dishes I also like: their seaweed appetiser, three-egg spinach, braised beancurd with meat sauce (how vague is that description), fried egg plant with pork floss, steamed prawns with garlic, braised beancurd with cabbage, and their noodle dishes.p.p.s. what I really mean to say is: we haven't had a thing on this menu we didn't liked."

The restaurant is pretty big and spacious. I like it that it is lit up pretty brightly and fresh look unlike most Chinese restaurants that usually go for a dimly-lit, warm and cosy feel. A very good place for a family meal or tea time with friends. Food prices are pretty affordable given the great quality of food and nice ambience. Must tries: Pu tien lor mee, homemade beancurd, stir-fried yam. Their chilli is amazing and goes well with almost any of their dishes, especially staples like noodles.- I usually end up with getting 2 or 3 helpings."

I'm not entirely sure, but I also think Food Junction has more stalls.The choice here is excellent, with a variety of Chinese, Malay and western food to choose from. The food court also has several cordoned off areas pretending to be full-fledged restaurants, and I've never felt the urge to try those.Some of my go-to's for good and non-fussy meals include Pepper Lunch Express, the Chinese noodles stall, and the fried hokkien noodles/char kway teow stall (I'll devote another review entirely to that)."

There was no notice about its promotion which was reported online on instagram. I checked with the owner that the promotion was available. Maybe because there was no notice and no one knew that there was a promotion going on. The stall offered the chinese style prawn noodles soup, with 3 different kinds of noodles (yellow noodle, kuay teow, bee hoon)  to select from. From the basic prawn noodle soup at $3.50 to the atas lobster prawn noodle soup at $28.50.But to celebrate its first month since opening, Lobster prawn noodle soup will be $26.50 instead of $28.50, $10 for big prawn and crayfish.Prawn Noodles with Clams (usual S$6.50)Today it was going at $6 per bowl.There was lots of clams which I had counted 18 pieces. All the clams were packed with juicy sweet meats, and no empty ones. The broth was flavourful and slightly peppery. Best there was no ""Kee"" taste in the yellow noodles. Although usually prawn noodle soup came with slice pork and crispy pork lard, but as this stall was ran by a Muslim couple, there was none of these items in the dish.

We ordered 2 of the 3 recommended dishes, the strawberry chicken and marmite pork. Together with hot plate tofu and oyster sauce vegetables, the whole course tasted average at best.I beg to differ from the reviews of Yi Jia found on the papers regarding the dishes as the dishes seemed like a try-hard at innovation. The marmite pork was overcooked and did not have a marmite taste. The strawberry sauce chicken tasted like fried chicken with strawberry from a box of ""yan yan"" biscuit dips. Finally, the service was exceptionally slow. From the time of ordering to the time the first dish was served, we had waited for an hour. Secondly, the dishes were slow to come out of the kitchen, as we nearly finished our rice before even the 2nd dish arrived. I do not recommend this stall to anyone with high expectations and one who has after-dinner plans as the slow service destroyed the pace of the meal."

The ang mo kio outlet charges GST and Service charge!On a monday evening, the business was quite slow, we were one of the 3 groups of patrons at the restaurant. Even though it is a coffee shop style, it was still reasonably airy, it wasn't too stuffy. They have huge ceiling fans to circulate air around the shop.Mellben is famed for not using any MSG in their crabs. I have eaten at Mellben 4 times before and each time, I am always happy to go home, without feeling overly thirsty, but yet the food is still very tasty!1. Butter Crab 1.1kg $66At $60/kg, the price has gone up by $2 since the last time I visited in december 2014 and the freshness is still there. My friends who visited from JB said this was one of the hugest crabs they have seen, and they liked that the meat was easy to pick off the shell and that the meat had a harder texture, wasn't mushy. This signaled that the meat was fresh.The buttery sauce was addictive, I loved it. There was enough meat to feed 3 adults in this crab.They also enjoyed the buttery sauce, which went well with the fried mantous.2. Fried Mantous 5 for $3Even though we had the mantous sitting for a while, they were still crispy on the outside. Alot better than the ones I had at AMK, whereby the mantous were obviously fried a long time ago, but since the business at that outlet is always so busy, the staff just quickly grab a plate and serve. These mantous were served to us, about 5 minutes after they had served us our crabs. Probably because they had to cook it after they cooked the crab!3. Fried Prawn Paste Chicken $12These chicken pieces were very plump and well seasoned. The fresh aroma of the prawn paste was addictive. I definitely enjoyed this plate of fried chicken. The skin was also very crispy, and not too fatty.4. Fried Hong Kong Noodles $5I loved how wet this plate of noodles was. The prawns in the dish were also crunchy and fresh. They wasn't alot of wok hei fragrance to the dish, but you can still tasted the charred bits of the noodles.It was very easy to make a reservation, although the lady whom I've made a reservation with 4 times before is a PRC lady, so knowing mandarin would be a plus. Do note they will charge you $2 per box to da bao anything. It is a ridiculous price, but whatever. Bring your box I guess?The service is okay, not the worst, not the best, but the 2 PRC ladies were friendly throughout our meal. Not sure if this is a bad sales tactic, but they told me the smallest crab they had was 900g-1.2kg, nothing smaller. Hence always expect to pay at least $60 for a taste of crabs at Mellben.Also, we were using a groupon and drinks are not included, and you have to pay for them seperately, we were not told of this, and it was not written in the Groupon T&C, but now we know"

As such, I went with herb and lemon and got a little toothpick flag that said ""Not so brave"" on my chicken! I guess it's meant to jokingly make fun of me for choosing a non-spicy option.As I was browsing the menu, the friendly manager walked by to introduce their latest items to me, including the pita which I ended up having. He also spent time to introduce their latest Nando's Periviledge loyalty program which was a mobile app. Spend $20 to get 1 chilli and collect chillis to redeem food! Having tried Nando's in Australia and New Zealand, their membership system there was addictive and it really got me to keep going back to Nando's and I'm glad that Singapore's Nando's is trying to implement a similar loyalty program.

Chicken Pita $11.90++Served in a lightly toasted pita, stuffed with chicken tenders, crisp veggie salad and creamy whip. This chicken pita is part of a revamp of the Nando's menu which just happened at the end of 2015. The revamp provides a wider option of their chicken items, rather than just having chicken with sides, you can choose to have chicken in burgers, wraps or pita.I love the combination ingredients especially the chicken tenders. You could still taste the slightly charred chicken tender which was so juicy despite having a glaze of creamy whip all around. The vegetables were mixed in well and you got a bit of all the ingredients in every bite. It was kind of a mess trying to eat this with a fork and knife, so just go all out and use your hands!2. 1/4 Chicken Herb and Lemon with Wedges and Mediterranean rice $14.90++Once you have chosen the size of your chicken*Price with no sides (on it's own)-  1/4 $10.90-  1/2 $18.90-  Whole $36.90and you have picked your sides (either on it's own, 1 side or 2 sides)*Each side is priced at $2.90 on it's own- Spicy Rice- Mediterranean Rice- Coleslaw- PERi chips- PERi wedges- Grilled Veggie- Garlic Bread- Three Bean Salad- Corn-on-the-conthen you choose you level of spiciness for your chicken1.

But be patient, it's all worth the wait!~ The chicken skin was extremely crispy, underneath the skin you will not be able to find any fats as the chicken had been grilled to perfection such that all the fat had melted away! You can catch the flame grilling action right behind the cashier!The wedges were crispy on the edges and soft and mushy in the center. The Mediterranean rice, despite it's look like it's a simple small plate of white rice was actually very tasty. The rice grains are a lot longer than your typical asian rice grains. They were also slightly harder with some oil mixed into it.3. 1/4 Chicken Herb and Lemon with fries and grilled vegetables $14.90++The PERi fries are addictive and I'm glad that they were generous with it. Not a single french fry was soggy! Woohoo! The grilled vegetables was a real treat and next round, I'm getting 2 sides of grilled vegetables. There's onions, capsicum as well as juicy mushrooms in the mixture. All of which had a nice char grill aroma.I highly recommend getting the 1/4 chicken with the grilled vegetables and PERi fries!4. Rainbow Cake $5.90++I decided to try something not so African and go with a rainbow cake for dessert. It was slightly dry and came on a freezing cold plate. I'm assuming that they had pre cut the cake and left this cake sitting on this plate in the fridge. The cake tasted okay and the butter cream was super creamy, very sinful. Not a bad way to end a grilled dinner. Just wished the cake could've been a little bit more moist.I must say that the ambiance is amazing! Very nice to chill, with the relaxing African cultural music that provides a modern tribal feel. The walls are well illustrated with pop culture. The service is efficient as well! We didn't have to wait for so long for our food to arrive. As I had ordered a coke that was refillable, the wait staff were always attentive to us and was polite everytime they asked if they could help us refill the drinks."

Nothing special about the vegs but its a good balance to the meal. Soup comes with big chunks of old cucumber & red dates, good to flush the food down your throat. Most important of all, the chilli!

If you are looking for good atmosphere, varied menu, good pizza, and reasonable (For Singapore) prices for large pizzas, this is the place to come.I haven't been to any of their other outlets, but this really has a good atmosphere, it feels like a true New York neighborhood pizzeria with the tile floors built around the large wood fired oven in the middle.They have a large varied menu which contains many great dishes, I've had their pasta and some appetizers in the past, I don't remember specifics,I was pleased and not disappointed. My last visit we did get the house salad, which had good dressing and was large enough for 2-3 people to easily share.The real draw to this restaurant, and the focus of their name is the Pizza. This is really good pizza, it isn't too fancy, it is just good pizza. They have a wide range of toppings and pre-designed types to order from including the traditional Pepperoni, which is always a good measure to judge by. The pizza is a hand tossed, thin crust, wood fired oven pizza; it has just the right amount of char on the bottom. The pizza is greasy on top, if that isn't appealing, take a napkin and sop it up as I have seen many do in other parts of the world. The table comes standard with napkins for this and utensils along with the usual, crushed red pepper and grated cheese to fine tune your slice the way you want.The $50 21"" is a great deal to ensure all are satisfied and you will have slices for breakfast the next morning, and if a harmonious consensus on the toppings isn't possible at your table you can always do a half and half style pizza. I advise making reservations as they fill up fast with families, couples, large groups and others looking for a good pizza night out."

(90s kids you know what I mean??) For Peperoni, its their speciality.  I ordered the pepperoni and seafood half and half 21 inch.Huge pizza, cut in quarters, it was lovely to my stomach and I'm loving all of it.The cheese is lovely but I think its a bit too much as I couldn't love the ingredients along with it.A lone stray hair came baked in the pizza but hey, its alright as the pizza is a pizza.I ordered a pasta - linguine in pesto... Its alright....not bad...little watery no oomph but cmon its a pizza place! So they're an aiight place to hang.

Isn't that neat?The pizza crust is thin, the toppings are fresh, the selection is vast, and put to the taste test, the Pancetta (Cured bacon, sliced tomatoes & egg) is delectable. The egg, still runny, goes perfect with the bursting-with-juice and huge slices of tomato, and the pork isn't like the typical American breakfast variety - still salty, not crispy, and tender. The selection of beers (Belgian!) is impressive as well - you have the leffes, the Satan Gold (oh la la!) and if you catch them at happy hour, you knock $2 off the price. Isn't that neat? Still a little overpriced even at happy hour - but worth it for the money you save on the pizza.Compared to the Greenwood Avenue branch, this has a more cutesy American diner feel, as compared to Greenwood's aged Italian pizzeria feel - but both joints have pizza with the pizzazz!"
