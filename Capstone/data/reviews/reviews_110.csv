It has many memories of my JC times and I absolutely enjoy the food here.The Char Kueh Teow (extra spicy) is a challenge for your taste buds, but is so fragrant you just cant help wanting more. The hokkien mee (or prawn noodle soup as more commonly known in Singapore) has a thick and flavorful broth. I love the lor bak and the balachan chicken.The wait for the food is usually longer since the restaurant is pretty small and they serve everything ""home cooked"" style.They used to have a student lunch promo but I'm not sure if it is still running! It can get a tad pricey without the promo though!"

It's been here since the 90s. The food is somewhat mixed with some dishes much better than others. Best is the duck soup. It's really rich and flavourful with a sweet herbal taste. There's quite a lot of duck meat inside too and the portion is generous - the portion for 1-2 can feed 2-3.The egg foo Yong is good too. It is an Omelette with lots of ingredients and is tasty and fluffy. The char Kway teow smelled really fragrant but the taste was only so so and didn't have a rich smoky wok taste. The laksa was ok but too spicy. The stock was decently rich.The lor bak was tasty, crispy and juicy but the spice mix reminds me of the Singapore version.The belachan chicken wings were not bad too - well seasoned and crispy.The drinks were most normal but nutmeg lime was interesting. It's the first time I've seen this drink. The nutmeg was judiciously applied and wasn't too strong, adding a pleasant twist to the lime.The Red ruby was pretty good with a reasonable amount of red ruby and clear jelly.What the menu called Gula melaka was really gula melaka sago. And it was great. The gula melaka was very rich and the coconut milk in it complemented it well.Most of the main dishes are a little small for the price though"

I know, ""but Joe, there are tons of joints serving Penang food,"" you'll say.  But you'd be wrong.  It's not Penang food that most of those other places serve.  So, let's just let that one go, ok?I used to frequent this place before I discovered Penang Place.  The food here is nostalgically authentic and on the menu, the char kway teow and Penang Rojak deserve  special mention. The char kway teow has enough heat, the noodles are consistently cooked through and al dente, the sprouts are crunchy and the ingredients are fresh but not as fresh or as plentiful as at Penang Place.   They also use a narrower more springy flat rice noodle.  Details, details....The Penang Rojak has fresh ingredients, an authentic base of pungent shrimppaste and a good quality chili paste which is likely homemade.  The water apples (jambu), kelongdong, and jicama chunks are dressed nicely by the rojak sauce and each holds its own in this crunchy, spicy jam session in your mouth.I didn't come here more often, because for Penang food, this place's prices gave me a nosebleed each and every time.  I'm not complaining, nobody put a gun to my head, marched me in, sit and order.  It's just that for what is essentially hawker fare at a mom and pop hole in the wall the prices are steep.  Again, just for the record, not complaining...just saying."

I especially like the lor bak- the meat is crisp on biting but at the same time still tender and melt-in-your-mouth good, and is paired with a special kind of sauce (sweet/chilli). Even though I've never tried their laksa, I've heard from friends that the laksa is also very well done and their generosity with the ingredients more than make up for the small portion. Their ngoh hiang is however rather mediocre with a pasty aftertaste. I've definitely tasted better.They are almost always full during lunch hour and dinner time, even though the turnover rate is pretty fast if you dont mind the wait. Sometimes, the food can take quite long to arrive because alot of orders that come in to the restaurant are not for dine-in customers. Overall, not a bad place to visit, but can be quite a pricey experience if you are looking to try a variety of dishes."

They also give you the option of putting fruits into the wrap.After you have picked all the ingredients that go into wrap. They will place the wrap into a panini press to cook it.
