The steamed prawns with garlic was just flat out not good. Can easily tell the prawns were not fresh. The texture was completely mushy on every single piece. The only decent plate was the veggie, which is incredibly hard to mess up. Should have known something was to since there was only 3 tables occupied at close to peak hours.

How did it take so long for us to realise how awesome it is?!They're a seafood restaurant but they also do meat dishes pretty well. A lot of their main dishes take time to prepare (it could be a half hour wait, or even longer during peak dining hours) but the wait is seriously worth it.If you're already hungry, I'd start with the salted egg fried fish skin appetizer. WARNING: These are extremely addictive. Crispy, just the right amount of salt, and not at all fishy. Almost like potato chips.They even have a chicken rice stall within the restaurant, so you could order from them if you need something to hold you over while you wait.The crab dishes here are fantastic. We've tried the steamed crab with hua diao wine, and the steamed crab with glutinous rice. If I had to choose, I'd go with the glutinous rice, because that in itself is already delicious.Last but not least, I really love their kou rou bao (steamed buns with marinated braised pork belly.) Again, this dish takes time to make, but DAMN SON. The pork is so tender and the sauce is boss.This is a great spot to go to if you have a big group, as the round tables can fit about 8 people each. Plus, the portions are big here, so they're meant for sharing."

This place opened along Joo Chiat Road a couple of years ago under the name ""Ubin Seafood"" owned by the people who formerly ran the original seafood restaurant on Pulau Ubin.To further add to the confusion, in 2012 there was a change of management, and the name of the place changed from ""Ubin Seafood"" to ""Ubin Kitchen"". Chatter on the internet forums tells me that the head chef from the original Ubin establishment still helms the kitchen.Complicated history aside, it's possible to rattle off a laundry list of signature dishes that one should order:Steamed crab & glutinous rice (for 3-4 persons at $58)Bamboo ClamsOyster Hokkien NoodlesSteamed belly pork buns (Kou Rou Bao)fried shrimp rolls (hae zhor)salted egg yolk squidfried rice noodles (bee hoon)In particular, the oyster noodles were tender and had a hearty sauce, old school style. You see clams in the photo but there's some oysters somewhere hiding beneath the noodles. The pork buns were a DIY affair, fluffy steamed buns arrive separate from the pork and you'd have to create your pork sandwich yourself.

The steamed buns came hot and fresh, while a separate plate held five slices of marinated braised pork belly. A a bit of a Do-it-yourself burger where you take a strip of pork belly put it inside a steam bun. If you'd like, you can also add a strip of lettuce to make it the more ""healthy."" :PAs for the steamed crab, it was nothing short of special. This is not just some crab you put in a steamer and that's it. Nope, these crabs have a sophisticated flavour that blends hua diao wine with the juices of the crab. Wow. While all the crabs in Singapore focus on Chili Crabs or Pepper Crabs, it was nice to try something different for a change.Overall, the food at Ubin Kitchen was fantastic! Food wise, I'm of the view that it's 4.5 stars, but have settled on 4 stars since the server did not inform us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for both dishes."

It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The steamed crab is cooked in hua diao wine and ginger.

We loved japanese food and the first restaurant that caught our eye was this as we were too hungry to search for the mall directory. We had never tried the food at this restaurant before and was rather intrigue by its menu. They don't service the usual japanese fare. There are a lot of stewed and nabe (hot pot) in their menu. They also dish out food for the health conscious as you can choose the 5 grain rices and all. Great discovery and will definitely check out their other joints.

Sitting in the coffee shop, one feels immediately immersed in the life of the heartlands, with the friendly Indian uncle who greets you in Chinese or dialect and never fails to crack us up. However, any local would know that Mr. Teh Tarik is a chain store with outlets in many places, a representation of the capital progress of our nation. This particular outlet is my favourite though for the atmosphere - a real, old-school coffee shop that never fails to remind me of what Singapore is to me. The prata here is crispy and not bad, and of course, the teh tarik is good too. For those who like to hang around the area, it is an excellent place for supper when it is not so hot to be sitting outdoors. The prices are reasonable at a dollar for the teh tarik, so it is inexpensive too. For the friendly neighbourly feel that is quintessentially the Singapore I remember, I'd definitely be back for many times more in the future ahead."

Then we ordered the set meal for 8 but they said we couldnt have it as ""no big prawns"" so we had to think all over again for a la cart which was only $80 less with less dishes and no doubt lowe value food. The fried rice was only egg no seafood for $ 26 and one small bowl each. The service continued to be inept and nonchalant, even rude. We didnt feel we were wanted there.

The famous pepper and chili crabs lived up to their hypes. All other foods were fantastic. Every dish that we ordered was good.

Once she took the initiative order, she checked with the chef on the ingredients and to warn him to wash the woks before preparing these special dishes. I noticed she was wearing a hair net after talking with the chef. This made me think there is a high standard level of cleanliness in the kitchen.All the dishes we ordered were equally great. Plus she order exactly the correct amount so nothing was left for 14 people. We have no idea how much we ordered of each item so we're now anticipating the bill. What did we get?Chili and pepper crab. I preferred the black pepper both both were good.  I liked the vegetable dishes. The produce is very fresh. One was Chinese broccoli and scallops and the other dragon greens, mushrooms and garlic. Cereal shrimp (okay but others liked it), beef and onion, fried cod (cubed) and shrimp friend rice. Lastly the mini buns were light and the outside crust lightly crunchy. With about 5 sodas and 10% service, the total price was $750 for 14 or about $50 a person. The service was fantastic.

Honestly, I was a bit disoriented.  Sweet is dessert for me, not a main course.  Maybe it was an off night, and more sugar was added than less.  Maybe I'm spoiled with phenom Indo-Vietnamese-Malaysian-Chinese-Cambodian-Lao-Korean-Thai chefs educating my palate in Los Angeles.  Maybe.  Willing to cut some slack here but if this dish should be soulfully sweet, then that was the last time I will have had the famous chilli crab.  I can't claim the crabmeat tasted sweet because it didn't (the creature traveled from another country).  Had it been caught in the nearest river or sea, it would have been sweet.   The other dishes we ordered were very good however:  prawns with golden salted egg, mee goreng Malay style, kang kong, fried rice.   Service was very good.Tip:  Jumbo Seafood is also a tourist destination, prices are high, even for Singapore.  I'd come to this location if you were to visit as it's on the water, if you like H20.  Check out the Yelpista pix."

Suppressing all scepticism, I took a visiting friend to Jumbo which is one of the four chilli crab Meccas here all lined conveniently next to each other along East Coast park. We got one chilli crab to share between two of us which cost around $62. No chilli crab is complete without deep fried buns to mop up the gravy and Jumbo's are just sheer perfection: crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside with just a slight sweetness to them. At this point, I need to throw up my hands and admit that YES Jumbo's serves some pretty damn good chilli crab. The gravy is delicious. Rich and thick, the best part is the sharp kick to it at the end. I was expecting it to be a lot spicier than it was but it had too much flavour packed into it to make up for it. The crab itself was juicy and tender. We struggled to get all the flesh out of the shell but it's worth prying out every little bit. The atmosphere is also incredibly relaxing especially if you snag an outside table right next to the ocean. The staff were all very prompt and efficient. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they made no motion to hurry us and even gave us a 10% discount at the end for no reason! My only gripe is the very small vegetarian selection which is somewhat understandable at a seafood restaurant. My mother got rice with vegetable stir fry which came in a tiny portion costing $18.

Quality of the crab is excellent - sweet fresh crab that goes well with the sauce. The black pepper crab is not as good though so perhaps stick to the chili crab for Jumbo.

Although I love crab, my boyfriend isn't a fan but we still decided to go because our new friends in Hong Kong raved about trying pepper and/or chili crab. We ordered:- Chili crab- Fried cod fish with spicy sauce- Scallops wrapped in yam ring- Broccoli with scallops- Steamed (white) buns and deep fried bunsThe chili crab was wonderful! The crab we received, a portion size for three people, was the largest crab I've ever seen!! Certainly fitting considering the name of the restaurant. I'm not usually a fan of filling up on bread, but it was difficult to resist dipping the steamed buns in the chili crab sauce. And.. this is was after I ate spoonfuls on top of my rice. So much flavor!The broccoli with scallops were fine, but the scallops wrapped in yam were even better! My boyfriend almost decided to get a second order of them. Finally, the fried cod fish was delicious! I would order that again as well. Our bill ended up around SGD 200-250.. If you're not opposed to taking a day trip to Malaysia (possible via bus, car or taxi), we were told you can get much more pepper or chili crab for much cheaper there! Regardless, I highly recommend you check this place out if you're in Singapore! Extra tips and FYIs:- There is no AC!- Make reservations if you want to avoid a long wait during certain days or times.- The menu has plenty of pictures and English to help guide your ordering.- Chili crab can be quite messy; I recommend using the disposable bibs they give out.- Don't be afraid to flag down any server you see if you need something!- If you have trouble breaking through the HUGE claws or other parts of the crab, you can put them on a plate and ask the server to have the kitchen break them for you! You don't want any going to waste :)"

We were seated quite quickly due to our reservation, and it was outside the restaurant closer to the water. I didn't really like our table because it was pretty close to where everybody goes to smoke so I occasionally had the odor of cigarette smoke while eating, but it wasn't too bad.The Chili crab and satays were very good, but the black pepper crab was too peppery.The cereal prawns had a lot of cereal but not too much prawn. The fish in banana leaf was decent. Overall it was pretty decent but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."

The east coast branch is by far the most popular on the island. I am guessing it's because of its complimentary location near the sea adds to one's seafood dining experience. It's super crowded on weekend evenings. Do not attempt to go without a booking, especially if it is a public holiday weekend. Overall, Jumbo doesn't disappoint. It serves quality seafood amidst a casual and family-friendly environment. Singaporean families (across generations - think aunty, uncle, cousins...) gather here for good seafood. Food: 1. Pepper crab - Awesome! Get your bibs ready! It can get messy. 2. Chili crab sauce & man tou - I LOVE their man tous (fried buns). It's fried to golden perfection! Crispy on the outside but soft & smooth on the inside. I could eat a plate of these (they are pretty small in size), especially dipped in chili sauce. TIP: you can order the chili crab sauce without having to order the whole crab itself. So you can have your crab in another sauce (black pepper) and still get to enjoy the wholesome goodness of dipping your man tous in the chili sauce. Double happiness. 3. Fried you tiao - LOVE! These are fried doughs stuffed with fish paste. It may sound strange to foreigners but they are heavenly. A must-try for sure. 4. Mee goreng - Good. A little spicy though. Be warned. 5. Mix vegetable & mushrooms - Good. The mushrooms were so fresh. 6. Steam prawns with egg - LOVE! The prawn was so fresh & sweet. It comes served with a sweet black sauce which goes so well with the prawns. I could eat this all day. Service: - Very efficient!"

The one on the East Cost is the best (IMHO). There is nothing fancy about this restaurant.  Come to sit by the ocean on uncomfortable plastic chairs, enjoy some cold beer, and devour as many crabs as you can.  The awesome Jumbo experience is very simple and consists of only five elements, so anyone can execute this plan.  Here it is:1) Sit outside, not inside2) Order beer, and then keep ordering it throughout the meal (you'll see why shortly)3) Order lots of Chili Crabs4) Order a ton of Man-tou buns (fried, not steamed).5) After you are done with the first 4 things, order Sago for dessert (even if the waitstaff gives you a hard time about it).I believe Chili Crab may be one of nature's most perfect food substances.  The crab is huge, meaty, and sweet.  The sauce is beyond compare - rich, tangy, and oh so spicy.  And extra good when you sop it up with the Man-tou (kind of like little savory doughnuts).  Lot's of fried spicy goodness there.  Order double the number of buns they suggest - I seem to prefer a higher bun to sauce ratio then is standard.I see many reviewers indicate you should go with Black Pepper Crab.  While that is a fine dish, I've always preferred the sauciness of Chili Crab.  But try them both - you can't go wrong.  Also, remember to wear clothes that can get soiled.  Those crabs are messy, but that is half the fun.Finally, let me put in a word for Sago.  It's kind of like cold sweetened coconut soup with melon balls and ice shavings.  Delicious, refreshing, and the perfect antidote to your burning lips from the yummy Chili Crab.  My Father almost passed out from delight the first time he had Sago here.In short, when I next make the long, long, long trip from Chicago to Singapore I will be heading to Jumbo."

Not because of the food, no, no, but because of how messy you will get eating the delicious, drool inducing chili crab. This is some of the best stuff on earth. Seriously. If you come here for nothing else you will be quite happy. The crab is really fresh and the sauce is just so he right amount of spicy. It's very messy and finger lickin good. We also had the cereal prawn that was just a bit too sweet, it tastes very similar to coconut shrimp and also the yam covered scallops. They were also very good. You obviously have to have beer with your chili crab so make sure to grab a pitcher of tiger. This is the third or fourth time here from America, I will always come back here to eat. I love it so much. I'll be coming here for years to come. I wish they sold the chili sauce by the gallon. I would just drink it."

In California we have different types of crab so was almost positive it would not turn out the same :( It's also really good if you dip your bread into the chili sauce!

Perfect blend of a spicy and sweetness of a crabBoiled live shrimp comes in a wine soup - get about 3 per person.Chicken/Beef kabobs- tastes good if you dip it in their peanut sauce!Malaysia dry noodle- reminded me to be similar to a spaghetti with seafood in it. Mango- not sure if its the right season or if its just always good- but the mango is soft and sweet! perfect way to end your meal.Ate a lot more- but can't remember the names.

Order some fried buns (mantou) to soak up some of that delicious chilli sauce, and you've got a fantastic meal. It gets pricey, but it's worth it. A few tips for those non-natives ( that I learned the hard way): there are no napkins. How you're expected to eat this crab with no provided napkins is beyond me, but that's how it's done in SG. Stop by a convenience store and pick up a multi-pack of tissues, since that's what everyone uses for napkins. The restaurant provides you with a finger bowl to rinse your hands while eating.

Order a few of the fried mantou (buns) on the side, and get ready to soak up all that saucy goodness! (Trust me, you'll need more mantou than you think!)  For what you pay (about $55 a kg) it's pricey.  A crab will be anywhere between $50-80, and it's not a whole lot of food, but hey, when in Singapore...The cereal prawn ($20 or so) is also really good, make sure you order it with the shell off. Breaded in a slightly sweet and crunchy cereal breading, it's well worth a try.And don't be afraid of wearing the bib for the crab (ask for it if they don't offer), even the locals do it!"

I heard Singapore is known for their spicy crabs so of course we had to go somewhere really authentic to get it. This restaurant has a really nice bay view but it was raining that day so we couldn't sit outside to enjoy the scene. So the food. There was 13 of us and we ordered what seemed like everything on the menu so that we can try a little of everything. We got the spicy crab and the peppered crab which I guess for a non-seafood eater was pretty decent although I still wouldn't go out of my way to eat crab. My family really enjoyed it since they are seafood lovers. I do have to agree that it's probably the most flavorful crab I've ever tasted. To be honest, what I loved most about the meal was the little buns that came with the crabs. It really was just white dough with a little sugar but it was so soft and chewy and I think I probably had ten pieces all by myself. It was an overall good meal but because I don't really like seafood, I probably don't have the best judgment. One little boo boo was that they messed up our dessert and gave us a 13 people portion instead of a single serving like we asked and ended up just not giving us anything in the end after we waited for it foreverrrr. The service wasn't great but I guess we were a pretty loud annoying group with two babies that anyone would find hard to deal with."

The staff were friendly, accomadating and spoke ok English. The line of sushi chefs wore gloves and mouth guards. They cranked out an endless line of sushi and other items. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all very tasty. The portions were on the small side, but the prices were reasonable (s$2-9) on most things, so we were able to have a wider variety of items.We loved that besides soy sauce, each table had a supply of wasabi and pickled ginger."

The broth is rich in flavour and explodes in your mouth. The uncle even makes it an emphasis (a sign) that he doesn't re-fill the soup as it would dilute the flavours. Wow, that's quality.

He gives 3 pieces of prawn and slices of lean pork meat along with a regular bowl, and nothing to complain.

As soon as I saw it, I had to have it. I'm obsessed with Sushirrito in the Bay Area and always order a sushi burrito when it's available. I was excited at first to see they had very similar rolls like Salmon Samba and Geishas Kiss, though under different names. I should have been deterred by the first reviewer, but I did not heed those wise words, and my excitement diminished when I realized they wouldn't make me a fresh sushi burrito. All the rolls are displayed as halves, so I thought maybe if I ordered a full roll they'd make me new one (nope, just two halves). And of course, it tasted like it's been sitting around for a while. Sushirrito tells you it's best enjoyed immediately, and I think that's true with any sushi burrito. Moist seaweed just doesn't stay good for long. Overall, not terrible, but not worth it."

The sushi burrito is alright. I've had better and would not recommend this. They have a display of their various sushi burrito options on the window for you to choose from. You can either get a half burrito or full burrito. The rice was bland and the veggies tasted old (not fresh). I  got the rainbow shrimp burrito, which consisted of prawn tempura. However the prawn tempura was mushy and soft on the outside. You can tell that the burrito had been sitting out for a while and not fresh.

Sushi burrito is basically like an uncut sushi roll with more ingredients. While that can sound attractive because hei, who doesn't like sushi?, but Sushi Burrito did it completely all wrong. I tried their unagi sushi burrito. The amount of unagi is like the amount you would get on 4 pieces of unagi sushi while the rice and fillers would make maybe 4 sets of sushi roll (4 x 6/8 of your regular sushi!). What are the fillers? Cucumbers, pickled veggies, onions and LOTS of rice. If I want my veggies, I would go get myself a bowl of salad. Lots of veggies maybe good for you but I paid to get a meal where I can taste unagi in most of my bites. Nope. It was mostly rice and veggies. For the price, I would not recommend this place. On the good side, their packaging is very handy for a quick grab and it is a healthy option."

But i began to remove those thought as soon as I had my second bite. They are different. It taste so good and still fresh although i doubt it when i arrive at the stall and looking at those sushiburrito that already displayed. They just took those premade sushi and served it. Although it is still good, i wish they can make it fresh. Idk how it works for people who order half size. Maybe they will make the fresh version of that? Perhaps. So i just want to conclude my review that Sushi Burrito is a better version of handroll sushi that i usually have. It taste better than normal sushi or hand roll. It has good appearance. But perhaps, maybe more experimental flavor/sauce in the future. Note: the wasabi burned me"

It is not too far from the Kembangan MRT and you could probably see the signboard from afar.Came here as Mel had purchased 2 Sugar coupons for the waffles and we decided to try the waffles with Hokkaido Milk & Honey and Figs . We also ordered the B.F.F. 4 types of fries and four types of sauces. The waffle was over-crispy but the ice creams were delicious. It was melting on the tongue after putting it in your mouth. Didn't really like the waffle that much as this time round it was over-cooked.The B.F.F. was interesting mix of fries. I like the truffle fries as it was crunchy but it doesn't have much truffle flavor on it. The wedges and the criss-cut fries were al-right (probably cause I've been eating too much other stuffs before coming here). I didn't try the shoestring fries (Curly fries?). The dips I have no clue what they are besides the tartar sauce.This place is rather cosy and inviting. On the walls it has writings and interesting quotes. Was not as crowded as I thought it maybe especially on a Saturday evening. Definitely a good place to hang out or even board game sessions :)

From what I understand it has opened for over a year now and I have just learnt about this place via the SUGAR app. It is within walking distance of Kembangan MRT. We managed to easily find a parallel parking street parking spot along Changi Road.1. Rack o' Ribs ($22.80)The great BBQ aroma from this dish would make anyone hungry! It was slighly charred to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. For Singapore standards it's pretty good, still nowhere near what I used to eat daily in the States. For $22.80 it's not too pricey, although that's as much as I would ever pay for ribs in Singapore.The meat was juicy and tender. The ribs were well executed with the barbecue sauce over nicely done meat.2. Waffles with Ice Cream ($5.80 each)With the SUGAR app, we managed to buy each waffle with ice cream for about $2 each! But nonetheless even at $5.80 It's still quite reasonable, compared to some cafes that charge like $9 for a whole waffle and ice cream. This is indeed only half a waffle but there's so much to love about this waffle.The waffle is delightfully crispy! It is not the fluffy kind, some online reviewers have mentioned that it tastes like over-cooked waffles or even ""burnt"". But to me, it was nice and crispy and I like it this way. The chocolate ice cream was a bit bitter, the green tea ice cream was nice and had the legit green tea taste in there. The salted caramel was the sweet ice cream amongst the 3 flavours. The waffle was slightly salty, some of my friends didn't like it so salty, but I felt that it was a good compliment for the salted caramel ice cream, since the ice cream was so sweet. Waffles and ice cream! Who can resist such a great combination of colours and flavours.The food at Rice & Fries may not be super awesome , it's nevertheless tasty and the ambience is very enjoyable.

The taste was very savory and the crust was thin and crispy. I personally like the crust to be thin, and pizzas with crusts that are overly thick and floury turn me off.We also had a few other pizzas such as the triple meat pizza and the pepperoni pizza, which were all good but no doubt, the pizza to try here is the seafood pizza.

The charred fatty cuts of meat are pretty much amazing, and I'm partial to the roast pork and roast chicken. It's also reasonably priced, at around S$4-6 for a packet of chicken rice. Ask for the dark meat (chicken thigh) instead of the leaner cuts. Trust me, it's worth the calories.The stall is located within the coffeeshop named ""Keng Bee Restaurant"" at the corner of the building facing the Caltex gas station. Seating within the coffeeshop is limited and there's parking at the back. The line is out the door pretty much at lunchtime, so do come early before they sell out.Depending on how long the line is, the guy at the stall might get a little grouchy or impatient with you. I also have to knock them for a less than stellar chilli sauce which is practically watered down beyond recognition.The stall is closed on Tuesdays, and a different hawker helms the evening shift at the same stall, so be aware that the food served might be different at dinner.TLDR; Old school roast chicken and roast pork with charred fatty cuts, reasonably priced but a bad attitude with a long wait.

It's got three layers of heaven: (i) juicy inside, (ii) marbled fatty area  and (iii) a crunchy skin.

Word of Advice: To best enjoy the roast pork, DO NOT put any sauce on top. It will dilute the flavor. However, be sure to ask the uncle to put sauce on top of the rice. The separation of rice with sauce and the roast pork is just a perfect complement.  Lines are obviously long, Locals already know this little secret.

So I got a plate of char siew + siew yoke rice, and sat down to wolf it down.Fate intervened of course, and uncle had generously slapped on my plate some rough cut meats, liberally marbled with soft, juicy fat. As I took a second to admire his handiwork before shovelling it into my now ravenous mouth-hole, I realised the beauty in what lay before me - the rough cut meant he did not stinge on razor-thin slivers, and the chunkier segments offered more bite and flavour, so I could really experience the char in his char siew.Though I did savour each tasty morsel, it was gone too soon, and all I had left was the simple soup to end what was a very tasty meal for just three dollars.

To upsize your steak, pay $5 extra.By all means it's not the best steak, you get what you pay for, really. Beef quality is only a small notch above Aston's or Jack's place. Fries are crispy out of the fryer, and for the salad, you get butter lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce. If you're in the mood, they do serve caipirinhas. :)4 stars cos it's value for money, but don't come in here expecting Morton's or Ruth's Chris.

The best deal on the menu is easily the signature Meat (you are getting the steak, no questions asked) served with an UNLIMITED supply of French fries and fresh lettuce.  P.S I wish they replaced the French fries with rice, kidding! Clearly, this is not an Asian restaurant :-)For doneness of my meat, I chose medium-rare. The rib eye steak came out fantastic. I had no idea the French could grill! You also have the option of three sauces: mango, mustard and chipotle to mix with your steak and fries. Don't fret, if there is no seating space on the first floor. There is a large 2nd floor with another set of 8 dinning tables or more. it's a bit neat to see expats living in the neighborhood playing a card game of sorts on the second floor during the evening. The big surprise is that there is a beautiful terrace in the back that accommodates 20 or more people, if you are keen for a fun night amongst friends under neath the stars and in an enclosed outdoor setting.Four stars for the price - $20 for char grilled steak and unlimited homemade fries and the fact you won't find this type of restaurant anywhere else on Joo Chiat or anywhere else on the East Coast for that matter."

The decor certainly is very impressive with books neatly arranged from wall to wall and old phones decorated at various locations. The ambience is great for catch up with friends over a drink. We've ordered our main courses all from the promo menu and truffle Parmesan fries. It took close to 20 mins before the fries arrived followed by pasta and burger. The Pork neck grill took another 10 mins to be delivered. Sadly, the burger and the Pork neck was more salty than needed while the pasta is blend. We are more sad that with all the truffle shavings on the pasta and pork neck, we can't smell the truffles. Which is very unusual as this is not the first time we've had truffle dishes. Even with the promotion, each dish is about $28. And for that price, I don't see the value when I have the 3 small pieces of pork neck done like schnitzels, topped with creamy sauce and potato chips that occupied half of the plate. We couldn't finish our food because I get tired chewing the pork neck and the pasta was too blend to warrant anymore consumption. The saving grace is the burger because it's not too big and, the parmesan fries has a very nice truffle mayo dip.

We ordered Eggs Benedict with portobello & Parmesan crisps and Smashed Avocado with Smoked salmon with Matcha latte & orange juice. While Matcha & juice was tasty & fresh, the food was bland.

It did look like it had a nice brunch menu, and their burger offerings for dinner looked quite nice. At around 6:30 PM however, they shut off most of the lights, which I think was a real mood killer. No need to have lighting resembling that of a sketchy club, when you are in a nice café where people want to go to talk each other, and in fact, see each other too."

And while the oysters on offer certainly are fresh and yummy and great value during happy hour (5pm-7pm) or all-night on Mondays... the real food. The proper food. The cooked food. Oh how brilliant it is.It's all small sharing plates, and the menu says order quite a few dishes for just two, but frankly we find that's a little generous. For groups of 4-5, between 8-12 dishes is more than plenty. What's good? Almost everything. Twice I've been and twice I've ordered all the garden dishes. The Brussel Sprouts are to die for. When you pick up everything on the plate you get salty-sweet-charred-heat all in a mouthful. The cabbage too. The burrata has been on fleek each time I've ordered it, and the Snow Crab and Manila Clams have me wiping the dish clean with the awesome bread each. And. Every. Time. I'd give the fish dishes a miss, I tried the tuna, the rainbow trout, and the ceviche and all weren't as impressive as the other offerings. For proteins I like the chicken more than the beef or pork. It's a well-crafted dish... though companions liked the beef very much. The pork was kinda meh. And definitely have desserts. There're only two but both are good solid sweets than really hit the spot. I prefer the panna cotta because it's not as sweet or rich as the chocolate mousse, but if you like a good mousse, this is as good as you'll find anywhere. ANYWHERE. IN THE WORLD. So... y'know.

There is a choice of outdoor seating but it is prohibitively hot in Singapore sometimes. I made an online booking via a third party website for 5 people on a Monday for 8pm a week in advance, and was surprised that there weren't any tables for 7pm ish. Steffi C and I arrived early, at 730pm and surprise, our table wasn't ready, and we sat outside. We ordered a few oysters but they only came 20 minutes after, when our table was nearly ready. We tried to hurry this Eurasian-looking server for our table but he was sort of... curt. Never mind.The fuss about Mondays at Humpback is because oysters are half price here, all-night. They do have half-priced oysters everyday, but only from 5-7pm, which most working people cannot come on time. You might want to avoid Mondays if you want half-priced oysters and have 5-7pm on another day free.They have a comprehensive cocktail menu, but I prefer my cocktails orders to be taken by a bartender and customized to my preference. We opted for a Riesling on our very nice server's recommendation.Because we were a party of 5, we got a few small plates to share, apart from the oysters. We had the burrata (yum!), gruyere and feta tapioca balls (yum!), brussel sprouts (I felt it was undercooked but my friends liked it crunchy), pork (too pink for my liking), wagyu (not bad), calamari (yum), tuna (we didn't realize it was raw, 3.5/5). The oysters were fresh, sweet, and nobody had the runs after. Not all varieties of oysters were available, as they source whatever is available direct from Washington state, US. I do love my PNW seafood. My peeve about the oysters were that for more than 20 oysters, they had a tiny pot of vinaigrette. Passing the little jar around was quite annoying.The unexpected star of the meal was the chocolate mousse. I will be sure to order my own portion next time I come here. Bill came up to about 75 per person, but we had wine and oysters and many many plates to share. I imagine it would be more expensive on a non-Monday. Book your seats!"

Until the day that I found out about this place through Natalie H. ""Oysterssssssssss"" was all she said, and I was in. The $2-$3 oysters (5-7pm on weekdays+saturday, all day on mondays) drew me to this place, but what really made me like it were the sides that we got. They're the guys behind Sugarhall in Telok Ayer too, which also has excellent sides, and I wasn't disappointed here.I really cannot find another bad to say about the sides we got. Well ok the pork was a bit pink, not sure if that was on purpose but I did recall someone at work (I'm in healthcare) telling me that you should NEVER eat raw pork and hence my fork stayed far away from THAT dish. Otherwise, the burrata, feta tapioca balls, wagyu, calamari, brussel sprouts and tuna were all excellent. I think I might come back just for the sides next time. The sides were bigger than I expected, enough for each person in a group of 5 to get a taster portion and just a bit more.Service was... well they were really crowded and busy on a monday and MAYBE there was just one poor guy shucking oysters because that's the only reason I think of to explain why the oysters took so long to come?I'll still come back though.

I've tried their competitor before and was looking forward to how good the impossible patty really was and it did not disappoint! Impossible Chedda ($23.00)This was such a delight to have. It still baffles me how they managed to get it looking, tasting and feeling so much like meat when it's all plant based. The only thing is, I wished the added less ketchup. It did feel like they were trying to mask whatever non-meatiness there was but having tasted the patty on its own, I think it would have handled itself just fine. The other parts of the burger was great too. The brioche bun was beautifully toasted yet remained soft and fluffy while the onion purée & pickles gave it an extra lift. Overall a fantastic burger Burning Rice ($18.00) The burning rice was pretty interesting too. A great option for friends who need something more asian while bearding to a burger joint. The rice had a good spice added to it and it's interesting that they serve it with a burger patty. Be warned though, it's a pretty big bowl of carbs!Sticky Icky Wicky ($7.00)Finally! A sticky date pudding done right. Too many times I've ordered a sticky date pudding or sticky toffee pudding in Singapore and it was a let down. This on the other when an absolute delight to have. It's warm, sticky, sweet, yummy. The kind of dessert that warms your heart and soul while you swallow it. Contrast that with the ice cold ice cream it's served with and it was absolutely yummy. Overall, we loved the place. The food we tried were really good and I will definitely be back. And yes, for the Impossible Burger."

My favorite was the BBQ Bacon burger, although the regular and chicken were also delicious. We ventured up to the very buys rooftop bar on the 3rd floor which had nice views of the city.

The food (mostly burgers) on level 2 (Three Buns) was good but not worth the price. I shared the Smoking B-Boy which was 150gm of beef patty with bacon and cheese and fried shallots (bawang goreng). The fried shallot was nice, gave a different dimension to the beef. For $28++, you just get a burger and nothing else. No sides or anything. I had a lemonade jerk which came with slices of grapefruit and lemon. It was fizzy and not too sweet. I could taste the slight bitterness of the grapefruit. I tried the sticky date pudding which was not bad but came in a tiny container. I nicked a bit of the ""chili fries"" which was also not too bad. The food is generally ok, but the service could be better or flexible. To be fair, it was only one wait staff who was that. The others were quite lovely. I was taken aback when the said wait staff flatly refused to do individual billing even before we ordered especially when we were a big group. Many eateries have started doing individual billing as it just made it easier for everyone instead of wasting time trying to figure out the cost. I have also been to places when they can spilt the bill even when it was just 2 persons dining. They need to play catch up in this aspect. The same wait staff was also very adamant about us hurrying up (close to 30 minutes of our arrival and we were settling in and looking at the menu, taking pictures and just trying to decide on what to order) in placing our order and telling us we need to vacate in an hour time. Again we were stunned. Never have I been to a place where the staff would actually say that. Usually if there is a time limit on the table, they would inform us once we got seated. Not after 30 minutes and then saying we have one hour to place order and eat. Thank goodness our efficient organizer kept the email reservation where it clearly stated our timing. It was for 2 hours, and if the kitchen cannot handle big group orders, then maybe they should not impose a time limit in the first place. And the place was fairly empty when we were there, definitely not full house with a line waiting outside. Another wait staff spilled my drink (too generous and filled to the brim) on me and my cloth bag (my ipad is inside!) but he was so apologetic and concerned that I just waved it off. And thank goodness it was a cloth bag so it was totally washable. I am not sure if I will return as the burgers were not spectacular (I would rather go to Roadhouse or &made or DB Bistro) and that antsy eager beaver wait staff certainly marred the experience in wanting us to just order, eat and go."

NOTE: Honky-Tonk was the only chicken burger on the menu, can't speak for the other burgers.We were sitting on the 2nd floor and the place looked nice until the sun went down and it became dark. Would have been a better place to have lunch at instead of dinner in my opinion. We also had to wait 45 mins for our dessert. We were told that the kitchen was busy and that it took awhile to warm the pudding. This would have been okay if the pudding arrived steaming hot which was not the case. Plus, my friend's reservation to the 3rd floor lounge had to be released to someone else as we were still waiting for the dessert. Overall, in my opinion it is overrated and not worth the money.

I like the multi-level venue that offers a different experience depending on the mood you're in.On the bottom, it's a casual outdoor spot where you can take away a burger or scoff it there and then. Past the charming door hosts and up the quirky stairwell painted by Melbourne artist David Bromley, you'll come to the dining area where Burgers and fun pre-mixed cocktails are the order of the day. The staff here are delightful, making recommendations and having a bit of fun with customers. I love their colourful shirts and great attitudes. The burger I tried was pretty bloody delicious, though a little soggy on the bottom by the time I got through eating it. Next time I'd skip the sauces as not only do they create the soggy bun, but they add unnecessary sweetness for this savoury lover.One level up and behind a big black door is a colonial feeling cocktail lounge. Here it's about serious cocktails, both the old school and the modern classics as well as some Potato Head creations. I settled on a Martini and loved the glassware and the delightful handkerchief-like placemat it was sat on. If downstairs is for the young at heart, this space is for proper grown ups... or those of us who like to at least pretend we are.Up one more level and there's a rooftop bar. We didn't experience this as it was a scorching day and I felt as if my face might melt off. On a cool evening, this might just be the pick of the bunch. Guess I'll just have to make another visit, right?"

I'd picked this place as it promised good food in an interesting location, and the decors (designed by some Australian guy with a fear of flying...) had been much hyped about.Good things first: The decor was really quite impressive. We were seated at the Three Buns restaurant (second floor) and blue floral designs decorated the walls with artfully mismatched furniture and quirky statues, lending a whimsical vibe to the area. Most guests are seated in comfy-looking couches surrounding low tables, but our group of 14 got the large communal dining table in the middle of the room. The stairwell featured checkered tiles and more interesting statues/paintings, and the bar on the third floor reminded me of a 1900s Gentleman's bar- dark woods, heavy furniture, the most amazing collection of liquor in bottles of every kind. It was amazing and one could really appreciate the planning put into the design of this place.HOWEVER, the food was just ok. Yes, this is a burger joint, but we were a bit disappointed that they didn't really have any decent alternatives for those who were craving something else. I mean, usually there would be at least 2 sides which could pass off as a decent meal on its own? But anyway, most of us tried the Baby Huey (beef patty), Honky Tonk (chicken), 4 stories (double beef patty)... The verdict was that the Honky Tonk was the best due to the excellent pairing of the buttermilk chicken fillet and tangy coleslaw. We tried the Naughty Fries (potato spuds with salsa and a hell lot of parsley) and Sticky Date pudding too. My fries were alright, luckily not as bad as the one that Natalie had. The Sticky Date pudding was good but the portion was TINY for $8.Bad things last: The service was pushy and hurried. We had a reservation from 1230-1430, and while we did take SOME time to order, there was this guy who kept on rushing us and telling us that we had to get out by 2pm... He must have said it at least 4 times in 10 minutes. (Turned out that they got the timing wrong, we left before 1430 anyway) Yes, I know that you're popular, yes, I know that you have tables to turn, but it could have been conveyed in a less authoritative tone. I'm not sure if they even apologised after we informed them that they had gotten the end-time of our reservation wrong.Would I come back? Maybe... But a return visit isn't near the top of my agenda now."

It's a cool place. But on the two occasions I went there, I found myself being pretty disappointed with the food. Overall all I can say was that the food was nothing special. It was not terrible but not quite worth the 20+++ price tag for a burger. The homemade cola and all were pretty undrinkable to most of us who ordered it. The service was bleh as well. I ain't gonna say much about this because I used to work in F&B and understand how it gets on the flip side. But bleh. Could be much better overall. It's alright.

I was bummed because it's such a lovely looking place. So I gave it a chance and asked if I could change my drink because I absolutely hated this dishwater. The server refused saying it was just probably not to my liking and they couldn't help if I don't like it. They would however add more yuzu syrup to make it taste better. I appreciated that gesture but I did not appreciate her reasoning. Some people sitting next to me overheard our conversation and told me this happened to them earlier too and they were told nothing could be done. So they left most of their drinks untouched. What a pity. Everyone just writes it off as bad customer service in Singapore. But I say, it's a top down issue.

Left me needing a huge bottle of ice water to wash down the taste.Honkey Tonk ($18) - the chicken was done impeccably well. Was crisp, tender and moist. Again, the bun was just a filler. Personally, not a fan of chicken burgers but the execution of this was pretty good. Likely to go back for this one.Finished off with a Sticky Icky Wicky ($8) - was moist and was not too sweet.

The entire Duxton Hill area has a nice vibe to it and I loved the setting of the entire place. However, the service was really bad. From the girl at the counter who was in an extremely sour mood, to our server who cold shouldered us the whole night."

The price was exorbitant considering the burger tasted mediocre (nothing special). It had a lovely sauce on in, but just felt that for the price we were paying it should have been bigger or at least come with a side. NOTE: Honky-Tonk was the only chicken burger on the menu, can't speak for the other burgers.We were sitting on the 2nd floor and the place looked nice until the sun went down and it became dark. Would have been a better place to have lunch at instead of dinner in my opinion. We also had to wait 45 mins for our dessert. We were told that the kitchen was busy and that it took awhile to warm the pudding. This would have been okay if the pudding arrived steaming hot which was not the case. Plus, my friend's reservation to the 3rd floor lounge had to be released to someone else as we were still waiting for the dessert. Overall, in my opinion it is overrated and not worth the money. If you are coming for the ambience try coming at in the afternoon or for a early dinner and if you're lucky you would snag a seat at the rooftop bar too."

After so much talk about Potato Head, I've managed to pull a decent excuse off my exercise regimen to come savour the burgers here.... and fries *ahem*.My friend and I came on a Sunday evening, and the good thing is that the place was not crowded; it was easy enough to get a seat. The problem is that it is located in Keong Saik, which means parking is always a problem. Hence, you can get a seat, but most of the time you're not gonna find parking.Tried: Rambo and the Burning Man burgers. They are very delicious, although I wish they were bigger. The buns are baked from whole meal, making this a little more healthy compared to the sin I'll be ingesting.- The Rambo burger is mutton/lamb, which they managed to mask over the gamey taste with lots of spices and I believe... a blue-cheese kinda sauce? I might be wrong, but it sure tasted like it. The combination of the sauces and spices sure gave it a pretty unique taste.- The Burning Man, now we're talking. A nice slice of beef patty well grilled with mayo and ketchup, topped with Californian jalapenos to spice up the taste. It was good. However, the burning man's jalapenos has some serious zing into it, which was fine for me but not for my friend... you have been warned!- Also tried the Naughty Fries, which are basically fresh but soggy potato chips slathered with a generous dashing of cheese sauce and beef chili (the Mexican kind). It literally was one of the best cheese fries I had so far.Rants: Wish the burgers could be bigger. The sizes of these burgers remind me of what you can get from MacDonald's (no not the big mac). That's the reason why I had two burgers instead of just one. And the prices of each burger is kind of expensive ranging in the $20s, without any side dishes or fries or salads etc.. Burgers are tasty, but the pricing still leaves a bitter taste. You have been warned!Raves: The whimsical theme of the décor leaves a nice chill-out location if you're into these kind of things.

Its super instagramable. I had pretty high expectations but after I saw the menu things changed. The food here is super expensive. Like 25 dollars for a burger the size of my fist. My sister ordered the burger and I was so shocked at how small it was.  It was literally a slider size.  I ordered the wings, which were meant to be appetizers but I got them as my meal. They weren't your average buffalo wings. The sauce on the outside was a spicy sweet chili sauce and there were spring onions and deep fried onions as garnishes. The outside was crispy and the flavor was unique.  They were probably the cheapest thing on the menu so I was actually pretty satisfied with my meal. The rest of the people that I went with got burgers and I felt so bad for them because of how much money they had spent on the smallest burger ever. Go here for average burgers if you don't mind over paying for them."

So I called in to make a reservation, but an automated voice answering machine told me I would receive a text message to complete the reservation, which I did. It was a short URL to make a reservation via Chope. However on Chope, I could only select a maximum party size of 6. So in the comments I asked for 2 more seats.A few hours later I got a call saying that their cafe's reservation policy requires each person to spend at least $25 and order a main course. Waffles which are priced $18.50+ with 2 scoops of ice cream are not considered a main course. Even the staff encouraged me to walk in. This is ridiculous. So we decided to walk in, and the food better be worth the effort!Despite the phone call, I was delighted to be greeted by the beautiful ice cream display!And I pinched myself to be sure I wasn't dreaming when I saw the $23 per pint price tag. Okay, let's see if their ice cream is really twice as good as other competitors, to be priced this high.The interior has a very homely, retro feel to it, the lighting isn't instagram's best friend. You will have to improvise or try and get a table by the windows.1. Beef Bolognese Cheese Fries $15+With truffle tries price at $14, we decided to try something else. Sadly, this dish wasn't what we expected, even though there is supposedly cheese in the sauce. We couldn't taste any. It was a plate of very soggy fries, with a very under seasoned beef bolognese sauce.2. Squid Ink Risotto $25+Tasted cheesy and I felt gerlat very quickly. This is the first plate of Risotto that I didn't like, I am normally a huge fan of Risotto.It's waffle time! Despite the unsatisfying experience with the main courses, I was so certain the highly instagrammable waffles with ice cream would be the highlight of my night!3. Waffles with Mao shan wang durian and belgian chocolate $18.50+I liked that the durian ice cream colour wasn't overly yellow, which a lot of ice cream parlours, normally add yellow colouring to, it didn't smell very fragrant but it tasted good. I liked the durian ice cream. The Belgian chocolate tasted okay, it didn't leave an impression for me. The waffles, which I was looking forward to, tasted ok, I've definitely had better waffles in the surrounding area.4. Waffles with Pulut Hitam and Pistacchio $18.50+The only redeeming factor that Chatper 55 had for me tonight, was the Pulut Hitam ice cream, which I truly enjoyed. However not all the girls at my table liked it. It wasn't displayed, but they had it in the freezer. You could bite into the black rice bits in the ice cream. It a legit, pulut hitam ice cream! The Pistacchio was also a memorable ice cream flavour. You can distinctively taste the pistacchio.The bill for 6 girls and we weren't very big eaters, so asking all 6 of us to order a main course each isn't the wisest cafe policy, even from a business stand point.The staff weren't well organized and took a long while to clear our table. The first staff cleared one plate, and a male staff cleard 2 more plates. We were done with all our plates and when the waffles came, we still had half a table worth of dirty plates. Only after the second waffle came to our table, did another male staff who served us the waffles, clear the rest of the dirty dishes.The chinese local lady at the cashier who spoke mandarin was very friendly and polite. I had higher hopes for their ice cream and waffles with such a high price tag on each plate. On the bright side, they have BOGO weekday lunch offers.wifi password : chapter55"

So today, despite the heavy afternoon rain, we walked from our office to sought out the place. Walking along Eng Hoon Street, the restaurant was easily noticeable by the corner of Tiong Poh Road. It's pretty big. One thing that I found very attractive on their signboard was how they highlighted their ""1 for 1 on weekdays"" offer.We went as a group of 5. Seeing that the restaurant is not Halal-certified, I couldn't try out their main courses, hence I went with the desserts. Like one of the popular quotes that I snapped stated, ""Life is short. Eat dessert first!""The appetizers came as bowls of mushroom soup. The mushrooms weren't in chunky forms but they were grounded in, which was nice!Two of my colleagues ordered one plate of white wine pasta (Vongole?) and the other, some sort of seafood pasta. Can't recall the names of the dishes, but both of them commented that the spices in both of their pastas were too overpowering; one even masked the white wine sauce. They also ordered buffalo wings (5 pieces). Personally, from what I see, those wings were overpriced. Such small pieces for $16?!Came my Salted Caramel Waffle and a glass of Black Cow. Funny names to give the floats: ""Black Cow"" for Coke Float and ""Snow White"" for Sprite Float. Well, as you can see from my waffle photo, I just loved the presentation. What a plating! Loved how they stenciled in cocoa powder of their logo at the corner of the plate. The waffle itself cost me $17 due to the fact that I opted for 2 scoops of ice-cream. Otherwise it would have been $15 for one. I opted for a scoop of Salted Caramel and Hazelnut gelato on my waffle, while I got another scoop of Hersheys gelato for my coke float. Loved the waffle!We even sampled a teaspoon of some of the gelatos on display. I had the Salted Egg flavoured, Cotton Candy flavoured and Strawberry Cheesecake flavoured... Nice. But definitely, I have tasted better and creamier gelatos elsewhere."

We ordered buffalo wings to share, I remember it being decent but not particularly authentic but on the spicy side.  The dish that blew me away was one of their fresh pasta dishes. The sauce was AMAZING, it is very flavorful and seems to be saffron based.  The seafood was very fresh, which is quite a rarity when eating out and reflects their attentiveness in sourcing ingredients.  It is also very reasonably priced.  To be honest, it was really out of my expectations.  I later read from other reviews that the chef is from Pasta Brava - that explains it.  Also read that its owner is the same as Ice Edge Cafe, a popular cafe in Kovan (ok too far for me so good they open one in TB). I tried a piece of the pizza that my friend was having, the crust was pretty good too.  The pasta was really filling as the sauce was so rich, so I didn't have any room for desserts.   That is a pity though as they appears to serve a great selection of gelatos.   I read that they have a 1-for-1 pasta deal during weekday lunch time and that's a pretty good deal, I would totally take advantage of this if I work around Tiong Bahru.  This is a pretty big space and can accommodate any group dining comfortably."

I don't see where it's 'hip' or 'ster'.Food is average. Mushroom soup is not Campbell's. Or at least to my un-hipster taste buds. Buffalo wings were like sweet and sour chicken wings, not spicy. Pasta was meh. The only thing I would come back for are the pizzas, Super thin crust and light. Nice.Ambience is homely. Lots of wood benches and tin pails for decoration. Seats are tightly packed and walk space is narrow. I might have seen a mason jar or two. /shudder""Will I come back?"" Yes, for the pizza and for the ""buy 1 get one free"" lunch special. Now the mechanics of this BOGO is dreadfully complicated and very sneaky if the customer is not careful. I will explain this in the next section. This would have been so easy to fix when asked, and would have won a life-long customer. But. hey, which restaurant manager would want to do that?Service is non-existent. Poor guys are overworked and do not have time for pleasantries. Price. Ahhh, the only thing this place has going for it is the 1 for 1 lunch special. When you get seated, you will see from the menu that not all items qualify for this. Items that do, have a little label next to it.So! Imagine the following scenario:Ah Beng and Ah Lian decide to try this new 'simi-lai eh hipster' cafe near Ah Mah's flat in Tiong Bahru.They order two muchroom soups ($11 for 2) This items is automatically 1 for 1. Don't know why they have to make life so confusing.Then Ah Beng orders a Vogole pasta MAIN for $18. Ah Lian orders a Funghi Pizza for $18.For appetisers, Ah Beng orders Buffalo Wings ($16) and Ah Lian orders Calamari Rings ($16).So, quick recap: 2 soups, 2 mains, 2 appetisers.QUESTION: How much was Ah Beng and Ah Lian charged for their lunch? (Assume no service charge.)ANSWER: You would think, this is easy! 1 for 1 mushroom soup + 1 for 1 MAIN + 1 for 1 appetiser = $11 + $18 + $16 = $45Wrong. Because Chapter 55 is so scared that customers will 'take advantage' of the 1 for 1 deal, this is how they calculated the bill:Mushroom soup is $11 for 2. (Written in the menu, don't argue.)Higher cost items are charged, lower cost items are free. (Written in the fine print, don't argue.)Actual bill is: $11 + $18 + $18 = $47Ah Beng and Ah Lian pays up and leaves, vowing to never come back and also something about mothers and fathers.Ok, ok, the story is a little dramatic for a difference of $2. But it is the principle of the whole thing. Even if it is not for principle, then it is about making a quick decision to make Ah Lian and Ah Beng happy customers. Long story short: After the trauma of mathematics and Chapter 55. Ah Beng and Ah Lian grew closer and lived happily ever after,"

Having had work in the area before, its one of the few decent food options available by that hour. Word of advice though for those who drive, good luck finding parking. And when business is brisk, good luck finding a table too. As the name states, they are famous for their porridge. Every possible kind with every possible ingredients / toppings is available here. Called me a traditionalist, but I often go with the staple Pork porridge with century egg. I like the portion sizes especially after a long day at work or play for you clubbers out there. As with most supper porridge stalls, they also serve frog legs porridge. And for those of you who irk at the thought of eating kermit, I will tell you the same thing my parents told me when I was a kid squirming at the very same idea, ""It tastes the same as chicken, only much nicer!"". Its really true as frog meat is lighter and sweeter in texture, and the flavours goes into making the porridge sweet and light too.And for more variety sake, they also serve a very good standard bbq chicken wings and also raw fish (chinese style not japanese sashimi) to go with plain porridge if thats your cup of tea."

I don't think I could ever get tired of either of these dishes. It can get pretty crowded, and you may have to wait a while for tables on a busy night. They have more tables at another outlet besides the small provision shop, so take a walk down that way if the main area on New Bridge road is full.

It's really hard to get Pork Satay and I remember lovin' it in Bali - when I had Pork Satay almost every other day - so it was a pleasant surprise to mix and match, Chicken, Pork and Lamb Satay - and the marinade is really yummy. The Satay turned out great and the peanut sauce was excellent too.What I Love: Service was great - the guy who took my order was a young chap, and was eloquent, and did the satay pretty quickly. Ketupat is free, when you order 10 pieces. You will get Ketupat, since minimum order is 10 pieces anyway. The meat was tender, tasted great, and flavors were just yummalicious! It's great to have satay, drink Coconut Juice, and sit out, looking at all the colorful lanterns. Great ambiance. What I Don't Love: Absolutely nothing!"

We were nearby during its official launch last Friday, so of course, we have to drop by and see (out of curiosity). I was expecting a long queue but to my surprise, there wasn't! We were there around 9-ish. There were over-enthusiastic staff cheering and screaming and giving high fives as we were walking in, I thought I was there to buy an iPhone for a split second. LOL. Queueing up to order was a breeze as there were 4 counters and at least 30 staff in the kitchen churning out burgers, fries, ""concretes"" and milkshakes so efficiently. Very impressive. The wait was manageable, around 20 mins for our order. There was also staff on the dining floor assisting customers with any queries, passing them cutleries, interacting with kids and basically being a great ambassador to the brand. The dining area is big and spacious enough with lots of seating booths, tall tables, and plants. Now onto the burgers - I tried various burgers from Shake Shack before, so I decided to try Chick'nShack. Delicious chicken breast slow-cooked in buttermilk marinate and then fried to perfection served with lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk mayo. Good stuff. We also tried the ""concretes"" - a term used for frozen custard blended with mix-ins. The Shack Attack is the regular cant-go-wrong chocolate mix, but my new found favorite will have to be Eye of the Tiger which is vanilla custard blend with lychee and top with lime zest. Refreshing and not too heavy on the palate. Overall, a pleasant visit and first-time experience at the new Shake Shack branch in the city. I can't wait to be back soon!"

You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center."

And the food and wine are both good and at a ""reasonable"" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The ""house wine"" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!"

I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal."

French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly."

The fam joined us for night 2, and we had a lovely booth to ourselves.Food was not an easy pick - there is a lot to choose from, and almost all of it sounded lovely! Over the two nights, we had loads: the cassolette of escargot was super tasty, especially with the garlicky mushrooms; the mackerel fillet was light, and the accompaniments added great balance (thumbs up for the dressing!); the lamb rack, pork trotter, boeuf bourguigon, and roasted chicken leg?

You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center."

And the food and wine are both good and at a ""reasonable"" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The ""house wine"" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!"

I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal."

French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly."

The waiters were all dressed up and the warm lighting inside with tables tightly packed were quintessentially Parisian. The menu did not disappoint. Good old classics like Coq Au Vin, Confit de Canard, Escargots and Soupe a l'Oignon got me excited. The mackerel salad had caught my eye as I remember a rather delicious variant when I was visiting the French Countryside. I went with that, as well as the Poulet Rotî ( Orast Chicken) for my main course.The Mackerel Fillet marinated in white wine with scented potatoes salad had been so stunning, that was all I could think of since then. The perfumed salad had a light floral and earthy taste, possibly the doing of a herb infused oil. The fish was not the least fishy and it was delicate and soft, marrying perfectly with the potatoes that were lightly dressed. The greens and garnishing herbs were light in flavour not too overpowering, lending a great touch to the delicate textures of the dish. The main course were impressive, enough to leave an impression and a longing to be back.I manage to catch a glimpse of the lunch menu that seemed very economical at just $30 for three course.

The soup soaked up the essence of the dish.Milo Bun with Red Bean Filling 美禄豆沙包 (S$5.80/ 3 pcs) Interesting having bun with skin made with milo powder, but I felt that the filling was more interesting as it tasted different from the usual type and had sesame seeds in it to give it more texture on the otherwise smooth filling.Crispy Pancakes 糖酥饼 (S$3.50/ 3 pieces)The pancakes were freshly made, crispy and light, without been too oily or too sweet.Traditional Pan Fried Bun Stuffed with Pork 傅統生煎包 (S$5/ 3 pieces)The bun was encased with thin skin with juicy filling inside.Wealth Dumpling 百財水餃Pork & Cabbage 猪肉白菜馅 (S$4/ 6 pieces, S$6/ 10 pieces) Similarly thin skin with juicy filling.Pan Fried Dumplings 锅贴 (S$6.80)Similar to the dumplings, but it came with light crispy base.Papaya Jelly 木瓜凍 (S$5.80)The coconut jelly was freshly made daily with rock sugar in limited amount, instead of the common castor sugar. The jelly was firm without been too sweet, and stick to the fruit nicely.Overall the food was delicious and well priced. The staffs were knowledgeable about its dishes."

Was taken here by local colleagues for lunch as I had heard and read quite a bit about the local Singapore cuisine that had sprung up when long ago the Chinese and Malay folks had intermarried and created a new local ethnicity (also called Nonya, i believe) and a way of cooking that melded the Malay curry cooking with traditional Chinese food elements.I put myself in the hands of my colleagues and thanks to them, got to experience an amazing range of starters, mains and desserts! The Assam Prawns were so good - lots of tamarind mixed with palm sugar and just balanced right for that sweet-sour taste. The Ayam Buah Keluak was another delight in each bite - the black nut had this amazing filling that i just could have kept eating all day long. We also got a vegetarian mushroom dish (I can't remember what its was called, but again, just delicious) as well as this dish of Chinese noodles swimming in a wonderful seafood sauce with tons of calamari and baby octopus (yum! yum! yum!). I totally over-ate and wished had a 2nd stomach - only being the company of work colleagues stopped me from licking the plate, it really was that good.Since there's always room for dessert, we got Ubi Kayu, which is a soft sago ball rolled into fresh coconut flakes - just so delicious, and prefect way to end meal. End Verdict?? I would so totally go here again!"

Ingredients easily found in China were not so readily available while in this part of the world, so local ingredients had to be utilized. Cooking with local Malay ingredients in a Chinese style and voilà, an early form of Asian Fusion cuisine was born.Cozy little restaurant that seats 28-30 people I'm guessing. The interior decor was designed to give that authentic shophouse style feel with just enough decorations and colors to tell you that you're definitely not in a Chinese restaurant. It's not uber-chic like Violet Oon's Kitchen but neither are the prices. Unfortunately, there was a large (and loud) table of diners next to us and made our dinner a bit uncomfortable, but at no fault to the restaurant.We had a very nice first experience trying the Peranakan cuisine. There was so much more I had wanted to try but with just 3 people dining, we just couldn't do it. The dish portions were not very large which made it great for sharing and offered a good way to try more dishes with smaller dining parties. I don't know if it's just the style of cuisine but the dishes came out of the kitchen lukewarm or more like room temp. It didn't matter because the heat from the spices made up for it! We tried Ngoh Hiang, Beef Rendang, Babi Pongteh, Garam Assam Snapper, Chap Chye, (and some others I forgot). The Babi Pongteh was a little weird because there were small bits of bones and cartilage in the meat, so it was not a very nice feel in the mouth, although the sauce it came in was nice. So the food was very good and definitely unique in taste, but as a friend suggested when I said we were having Peranakan, everything starts tasting the same after a few dishes. So my suggestion is to try to order dishes that spreads out along the taste spectrum (i.e., spicy, tangy, sweeter, etc.). A welcomed unique cuisine that offers so much more that what we experienced today. Will be back to try the other menu items."

The food ,although in limited proportions was quite tasty. Of particular to mention was beef rendang, fish head curry and long beans Sambal.

I felt a bit lightheaded and my leg muscles were starting to feel painful. We had initially planned to eat at the hawker center but decided we needed AC. this place was small, quiet and super cool inside. We ordered the fish head curry, rice and chop chye. The curry was really really spicy but in a great way with mustard seed and chili and beans and eggplant. I think the spices revived me. The chop chye was decent and had some sweetness that countered the heat from the curry. In order to cool off afterwards I had the tapioca balls with coconut ice cream and palm sugar which reminded me of the yummy desserts I had in Bangkok. The hub ordered something with durian purée on it for the experience. He said it tasted like a rotten sweet garlic. Anyhow the prices at this place were worth it - the curry was 23$ and more than enough for us to share. Anyhow after lunch I felt much more normal and ready to face the heat again outside."

The fish and chips were suprisingly good, not dry and mushy like how it can get. As you cut the fish, it slices into ""flakes"" which told me ""yes this fish is fresh! The vanilla icecream was delicious too. It wasn't just like your normal off the shelf supermarket type ice cream like how i expected.

One of it had thai basil leaves which was damn tasty! Both sausages were juicy and weren't drowned in sauce. For her dessert she had the fresh donut with a side of salted caramel creme.

My team and I had lotsa Chinese food during this festivity, we wanted something different for a change. That's when one of my team suggested to go to ""the study"" as she had been there and had some glowing reviews about the food. ""The Study"" features British comfort food, or so they say... We were about to find out. Have to warn you though... Parking is rather difficult as the restaurant is located in quite a snazzy hot spot where both locals and tourists frequent for food and drinks. Best if you drive up along Neil road to get a spot at the public parking lots, cos if there isn't, you get another chance around Bukit pasoh. Otherwise, just take the MRT, nearest station is at Outram. Restaurant is located nearby with a short walking distance.""The Study"" is a small, cosy restaurant with approximately 40s seats, and styled with modern retro English deco. You have the kitchen within the space of the restaurant where you can get a good view of the talented chefs preparing food. Totally love the vibe!Our order for the evening included:Starters:1. Heirloom Tomato salad with truffle burrata- I totally love this dish! The tomatoes were sweet/sour and was the perfect partner in crime for the truffle burrata. I love how you get the light, refreshing taste of the tomato first then your tongue tastes the truffle burrata, where it starts to fill it with the creaminess of the burrata. That experience is really quite awesome. The only gripe for me was that there was not enough burrata on the plate and I wanted the entire plate to myself! 2. Iberico Pork and Foie Gras scotched egg- This dish was just so beautiful to look at! To me this was something new and it really had an awesome taste to it. The Iberico pork with foie gras somehow tasted like the less salty version of minced spam. I could not taste the foie gras at all which made me slightly disappointed. The crust was crisp and complemented the dish well. To me this dish was yummy but if the chef can do something to bring out the taste of the foie gras it would have been perfect.Mains:3. Baked sea bass with truffled gnocchi- My colleague ordered this. The fish was pan fried to crispy goodness and the gnocchi was al dente. Again, I could not taste the truffle on the gnocchi. Otherwise this is a rather satisfying healthy dish. 4. Roasted lamb loin with Yorkshire pudding -  I asked for medium, but it came out medium to well, causing the lamb to be rather hard. To me this dish wasn't memorable. It was ok to taste but I wouldn't order again. 5. Beef rump steak with crispy shallot rings -  In my opinion, this dish is the restaurant's true signature. The beef that was cooked medium rare (don't worry it's not bloody) and was superbly tender. Definitely a must order! Dessert:6. Doughnuts with cinnamon sugar and salted Caramel cream- OMG! This is a must order! The doughnuts are fried till crispy perfection, the outer layer crisp with cinnamon sugar and the inside dough is buttery soft and fluffy. The salted caramel cream is super light and very Delish! And when eaten together, Pls don't be surprised if you find yourself doing the happy dance! 7. Vanilla cheesecake with ginger crumble and raspberry sorbet- After you have tried the doughnuts, everything else pales in comparison. Hehe... Ok but to be fair, this was not bad. But it would have been better if the chef was able to bring out the taste of the vanilla. I tasted more cheese than I did the vanilla.So was this comfort food to me? I can't say for sure. There were some unique dishes which I very much enjoyed but there were some misses as well. Additionally for what each dish was worth (pricey), the portions were also a tad small even by a lady's standards. That said, this is still a pretty good restaurant to hang with your friends after work for food and drinks. I too will return to try their other dishes. Ps. Please make reservations in advance to avoid disappointment."

After a few hits (the hawkers market) and misses (the white rabbit), the Study really really impressed. We booked early on New Year's Eve. Grabbing a couple seats by the bar we had full interaction with Chef Ayo and his staff. Coming early probably helped as we saw all of their early prep and were able to watch through the night the way they prepared as well as watching the chef schooling his crew in some of the finer points of service. Chef regaled us with stories of his background and we had a great discussion about knives and his use of lamb fat!  I was impressed as we sat down to some roots manuva blasting away followed by a greatest hits of 90s hip hop. A perfect way to set the Eve tone. We shared the scotch egg and heirloom tomato salad. Both were excellent. Tomatoes in this part of the world are hard to find. These were fine set off by some excellent frisée and truffled burrata. The scotch egg was as advertised. Held together by a juicy pork exterior. Clearly a signature dish. Next up was the special : turkey with bread sauce. My step mom with her UK heritage waist fascinated by tiebreaks sauce with was tasty bright and set off the sous-vide turkey perfectly. My lamb was excellent - cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The only disappointment was the leek, kale and pine nut side. A bit limp and watery. Finally ended with a very creamy rice pudding and tasty mango sorbet. Excellent unobtrusive service and access to their fun speakeasy next door. Highly recommend.

For the record, I waited approximately 2 hrs and 30 mins before my turn. I still find it amazing how bak kwa is a such a prized commodity during CNY. Customers from Hong Kong and Malaysia can be easily found among the Singaporeans buying kilos and kilos as gifts for relatives. Yet It is not hard to understand why because the bak kwa definitely lives up to its reputation. Soft, tender and flavourful. Not greasy or tough and filled with fat like other commercial brands (i.e. Bee Cheng Hiang and Frangrance).  Once you tried it, you wont want any of the cheaper options.For those of you who have been hiding under a rock or just plain ignorant yet think highly of themselves, they have 3 shops in Singapore. The main and best is the one along New Bridge Road just beside Pagoda St near the MRT. Yes, thats the main one.

That's probably why I've learnt to associate claypot rice with nighttime fare. Try consuming it in the afternoon in our climate without disintegrating into a puddle of sweat... confirm heatstroke lor.The reason why Lian He Ben Ji's claypot rice is a cut above its competitors is precisely because it doesn't compromise on cooking time and ingredient quality. Each pot of rice is steamed for 5 minutes, after which ingredients are added and the pot left to sit over a blazing charcoal flame for the next 20 minutes. That guarantees you a minimum 25-minute wait per order, which can stretch to a waiting time of 45 minutes during peak dining periods. To get around the wait, regular diners know to call to place their orders in advance. Unfortunately we weren't as savvy.Was the wait worth it? Abso friggin' lutely.Mixed claypot rice, $10 for a portion that feeds two - After drizzling some sweet soya sauce over the rice and mixing everything together, the first spoonful of rice I had can only be described as a flavour explosion. The pieces of chicken were succulent, the lup cheong (Chinese sausages) and waxed meat firm and juicy, but the rice - the rice was in a realm of its own. You just have to taste it to know that charcoal makes one hell of a difference in cooking this dish. The rice in the claypot was smoky yet fluffy, and when drenched in sweet sauce was just... wow. We kept mumbling ""so good, this is so good"" in between mouthfuls of rice. It got even better when our spoons hit the bottom of the pot, where burnt rice, or what we call guo ba (锅巴), was clinging to the sides, just waiting to be scraped off.And the chilli! The chilli here is the bomb okay. It was spicy, sour and caused beads of sweat to form on my temples, but I kept going back for more.To be fair, the slivers of salted fish in the rice could have been less mushy. Plus the soup (lotus root with pork ribs) and stir-fried veggies we ordered were very average. But who really cares? It's a hawker centre, and there're about 50 other stalls if you must have your sides to complement this... claypot of perfection.Now into its second generation of owners, Lian He Ben Ji is an established business that started off as a roadside stall in the same area back in 1979. The founder of the stall handed the reins over to his daughter-in-law, which I think is a really heartwarming tidbit of news in a society that unfortunately still tends toward the patriarchal. The daughter-in-law now runs the stall with her two younger sisters, which is why this place is also known fondly as ""3 sisters' claypot rice"".Lian He Ben Ji gets my seal of approval for their dedication to their craft. I'll definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know."

Wrong choice, each claypot is big enough for two servings each and we ended up leaving the second pot hardly touched.

They also serve the softest pork belly and tastiest kimchi jjigae I've had in Singapore yet. Let's talk banchan. Their kimchi is fresh and is one of the most legit batch around town. The seasoned bean sprouts were salty yet yummy. The seasoned anchovies were the saltiest and must be accompanied with something bland (ie: steamed egg, rice or wraps). The fish cakes were mild while the potato salad was slightly sweet and perfectly soft like mashed potato. While other K-restaurants tend to serve bland side dishes, Superstar K isn't shy to make their banchan take the spotlight. I thoroughly enjoyed the signature King Galbi due to its just-enough-chewiness and not-too-sweet marinade, however my foodie partner preferred the sweet marinated short ribs from Han Kook Gwan more (they were also fresher). To each man his own. We both agreed that the Kimchi Jjigae is one of the most delicious and flavorful we've tried in Singapore. It is like the ones served in Los Angeles' Koreatown. Spicy yet in a sophisticated way. Typically Korean restaurants play Kpop music videos on their television screen. At Superstar K, it's ""Wreck It Ralph"" on replay. I love that movie, but my eyes prefer to feast on Kpop while eating K-food! And if I were eating Indian food, I'd want to watch Bollywood films not Cinderella. Verdict: I'd come back to Superstar K for their Pork Belly, King Galbi and Kimchi Jjigae. And you should, too. However I give a C for Ventilation (my hair smelled of KBBQ for the rest of the night up until I woke up in the next morning). But I'd still go back for the King Galbi again and again :D"

I usually go for two servings of the unseasoned beef ribs, the meat is very high quality and there is no need to drench it in seasonings and mask the flavor. The waitresses grill the beef for you at the table. Each table is fixed in position and can fit from 1 - 6 or so people. They bring fresh charcoal to grill the meat before the meal.You also get a free steamed egg dish with your meal. Basically a steaming pot overflowing with egg is delivered to your table soon after you place your order. It looks intimidatingly large, but it is light and serves as a good appetizer. Another winning dish is the cold noodles in chilled broth, which comes in a huge silver mixing bowl complete with thin slices of beef and a boiled egg inside. Vinegar and mustard are provided to adjust for taste. It's a nice contrast to the heavier beef dishes to end the meal.No reservations and the place is popular, so you will probably be looking at a wait if you go during peak eating hours. No worries though, put your number down, grab a beer nearby and they'll give you a buzz when your table is ready. 20-30 minutes wait is common."

This store is pretty small so there will be a wait list if you come during the weekends. The parking was difficult as there are other restaurants and pubs nearby. Sitting outside while waiting for your table might make you sick of smelling the cigarette smells. The downside of waiting till you are seated is when most of your party have not arrive. They will only give you a table when most of the people in your party has arrived. The maximum amount for a party is 10.This place served a lot of side dishes (kimchi, steamed egg, bean sprouts, anchovies, potato salad and sliced fish cakes). All of them are extremely delicious!! The taste, the texture are in perfect blend. You will at least ask for two rounds for the side dishes.My party ordered pork belly, chicken and cubed beef. It was delicious!! The waitress will help you flip the meat and put on new batch of meat after you are done with it. The customer service was good here.Overall, I like this restaurant and will be back for more with different batch of friends. It is highly encouraged if you use public transport instead of driving there yourselves. Like I mentioned earlier, parking was terrible. Enjoy your delicacy here :) Cheers!!"

Bold choice but there we go.We got a larger table in the centre of the restaurant after a small ""discussion"" with one of the waiters as he wanted to place us behind the entrance door and argued that he might need the bigger tables later on when they get busy. As I had a table reserved - hinting that it was our anniversary - I had expected something else than the back of the entrance, thus I did not like that part of the evening especially when, later on, lots of tables became available.The evening got much better after that as we started with Prosecco, parmigiana and octopus - and their amuse bouche which was a lovely bruschetta.For mains we ordered tagliatelle with lobster and pasta with mussels and fish roe, and had a wonderful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to drink.It all tasted very fine and very authentic - I loved the fact that most employees spoke Italian and that Italian music was blaring from the speakers. Only the interior could benefit from a bit more ""love"", like tablecloth and candles. It all seems a bit too rustic for my taste, as if ""unfinished"".The dessert - a delectable Tiramisu - was the perfect ending, with some Limoncello on the house.

Champagne long ribs - this is one of their most popular dish and it was a great balance between salty and sweet. The meat was slightly tough to chew/burnt at the ends but the middle was tender and juicy Fried rice - we were originally going to order the medium one but the waitress suggested the small one since she said that would be enough. She was right! The small rice is enough to comfortably feed at least three people. Cray fish cooked in garlic sauce - this was an in season dish suggested by the waitress. The cray fish was very very fresh - the meat peeled off the shell easily and was a great addition to the other two dishes we ordered. All in all we had a positive experience. The waitress was very nice and helped us order the perfect amount of food. The food was way larger portions than expected ( we were expecting small portions based on the menu photos) everything had great flavor. Highly recommended!

This is my personal favorite.  If you don't really like tofu, this might even make you a believer.   Ok, maybe not, but definitely worth a try.Cereal prawns.  They're prawns, so they're not petite.  Make sure to squeeze the heads out like toothpaste tubes for all that additional goodness.Stir fry veggies.  They do one with a vegetable like an endive.  With hot garlic...just the thing.  Crunchy with just that little spicy vegetal kick.  So good."

We had the lotus seed duck (lian2 zi3 ya1) - an off menu item that the waitress kept pushing (saying it was very popular and tasty and only available on Friday to Sunday). When we ate the dish at the restaurant, we found that there was a lot of stuffing - lots of yam, chestnut,  carrots, leeks - and virtually no duck. When we brought the rest home we found more duck - but this shows that the serving style/orientation of the duck is poor and doesn't give you a good balance of duck and stuffing. And at $52 it was expensive too.The house tofu (zao1 pai2 dou4 fu4) was okay - the tofu was silky and smooth tofu but the sauce was a very pedestrian brown sauce. Since it is ""招牌"" (""house speciality"") tofu I was expecting much more.We also had champagne pork ribs, which were not very crispy. The sauce was uninspired, and the taste also didn't penetrate all the way through.Although the place was really crowded, the food still came very fast. So I suspect the kitchen was taking shortcuts, which might've explained the food quality.We were also seated in the overflow area - outside with no fans.

The restaurant itself is pretty small with only about seven tables or so inside, but there are many tables outside some of which spill into the parking lot.We went with some friends that live in Singapore and eat here on a somewhat regular basis so service was pretty good compared to what I've read elsewhere.The meal started with some peanuts, which were kind of oily.There were vegetables topped with crushed peanuts with a slight bit of chili but nothing overpowering.The fried tofu is one of the house specialties. The tofu was soft and creamy on the inside with a nice firm texture on the outside.The Calamari with Salted Egg crust was a favorite among the table, but I'm not a fan of salted eggs so this was one I personally did not enjoy.The Cereal Prawns are prawns that are lightly battered and then deep fried whole, with the shell and head on. It is then topped with a cereal mixture which is reminiscent of Captain Crunch. The cereal is very sweet, almost too much in that is sort of detracts from the taste of the prawns.The Steamed Fish is topped with cilantro and green onions in a soy sauce based sauce. The fish was nicely cooked and remained moist and tender. The fish is delicate in nature. This is a nice, clean dish which isn't very heavy.The Singapore Chili Crab was a large crab which was full of meat, especially the claws. The sauce is tomato based and was somewhat sweet and not at all hot. The dish is very messy, but what good food isn't? The dish comes with bread that is perfect for sopping up the sauce.The overall meal at Por Kee Eating House was very enjoyable.

My recommendation is the porridge called ""OJIYA"" in Japan. After we eat Thai style fish hot pot (Sea bass or Soon Hock, etc. any fish can lah), request staff to bring 3 raw eggs, chopped green onion and cooked Indica rice. Then pour the rice in the pot, boil about 10 minutes. Once the rice become softer, add eggs and green onion, wait a few minutes then ready to eat. This way is Japanese traditional culture. Some staffs might reject to bring items for the porridge. Then try to request with Chinese language."

Another famous dish is the Thai-style fish. The soup is very refreshing and you won't be able to stop drinking it. It's not overwhelmingly spicy nor garlicky, but it just struck the perfect balance to me.I also like their champagne ribs. You can get the individual portions which is 1 long rib per person, or the group version, where the ribs are chopped off to smaller pieces. Both are equally good.Don't forget to order dessert too. They serve killer mango pudding and yam paste."

I think the flavors were good, but the cooks have a terribly heavy hand with the oil. every dish was just a bit too oily, even the vegetables, which left you with a greasy feel on the mouth - rather off-putting to me. I'm a little fastidious about this - so everything ended up getting a dip through a bowl of hot tea.we'd return more frequently if the dishes were less oil-slippery, the meat less fatty - as it is, there are cze char places out there with a lighter hand in cooking, and similarly expert flavors. so, this place, I'm going to deem as divisive - I certainly can't begrudge the flavors here, and the cooking style could be right up your alley.reservations definitely needed, and it's a good place for family. if you find eating next to the carpark (with parking cars and the sometimes whiff of exhaust) uninteresting - make sure you let them know when you call."

I much prefer being delivered the right amount of food rather than too much. We ordered from the prix fixe menu which is quite reasonable at $22 or so SGD. My wife had meatballs with fettuccine in a marinara sauce, chicken broth soup with vegetable (quite fresh, I might add). I had chicken in a panang curry sauce along with a delicious salad with marvelous, fresh and copious amounts of fungus on top. The dressing was sesame, soy, olive oil and a bit of sugar/sweetener -- excellent. The wine I ordered by the glass - a French merlot - complemented perfectly. We shared a side of spinach with egg which was also quite fresh. If they retain their demand for fresh ingredients coupled with their ingenuity for flavor combination and balancing, they should continue to succeed.Overall a very good experience at Eight.

The drinks and wine selection here is amazing. They give good recommendations and their food options are cool - it's French/Asian Fusion and Mediterranean.What I Love: What I ordered, the Duck Wasabi Salad, was to die for. It's hard to get really good salad, especially when it's Duck. For this salad, the flavours blended perfectly. My friend ordered the Laksa Pasta, and another had a steak. No of us complained.What I Don't Love: The prices. This place is pretty chi chi and nice, and a dinner there (plus drinks) would set you back $40 to $60 per person.

I LOVE the nanban. Freshly fried with some lettuce within, with an awesome tartar sauce. I should have gotten two nanbunsss. The salted egg shrimp was okay - could have been better if the shrimp was deep fried and the sauce could actually coat the shrimp, instead of dripping everywhere.

Instead of keeping the similar type of decoration, the Bao Makers stripped everything to white. From the outside the café stood out quite well due to the colour. On the inside, they also kept the minimalistic industrial look with the cemented walls and wooden furnitures, perfect for hipsters to hangout. We visited the Bao Makers on the last day of our holiday when we were quite full from our previous dinner, but at the back of my mind I always remembered my conversation with Em that I'd go and try the bao at this place. So without further contemplation I dragged hubby in and ordered two baos, the chili crab and Korean bulgogi pork. I like both but the succulent and spicy chili crab definitely delivered more flavour especially with the crispy golden bao. I really like the idea of infusing the local dish into the bao, something that I never seen before at other places. The filling for both baos were sufficient. Since Hubby was craving for dessert he also ordered a pretty serving of lemon meringue sundae. The meringue came as the topping in the shape of rose, the rest of the ingredients were lemon sponge, lemon curd and vanilla ice cream with almond slices. It was delicious but a bit awkward to be called a sundae except if you break the meringue and the sponge cake, then mix the whole thing together with the ice cream.  We had a good time at the Bao Makers and we hope they will be a one stop shop for bao and able to come up with a lot of different fillings next time we go to Singapore."

You'll need  at least 2 to fill you up (they also require a min of 2 baos per order). So a meal here will set you up for more than $10. Aside from the price, the taste doesn't quite make the cut. While the nanban chicken (fried chicken) is nicely fried and served out piping hot and crispy, the marinate on the chicken doesn't come through and there is also too much mayo with the tiny piece of chicken.The chilli crab bun is a take on a Singaporean favorite. While it is full of real shredded crabs, the accompanying sauce is a diluted chilli liquid that has nothing of the usual eggy crabby gravy of a good chilli crab sauce. Place is typically hipster with nice simple decor but the taste and value of the food is not enough to bring me back."

I didn't read the review or find out about more this cafe as I wanted to get an element of surprise and I did! The cafe is quite spacious as there is good amount of privacy between you and the other customers. If you are in a big group (around 6-10), you be pleased to know there is a Long table and if needed, they just add a table or two. Perfect for some catching up as its quiet and not crowded for most of the time, according to another Yelper. Orders are self service and free wifi is available but you have to ask the staff for the password. It would be nice if they could leave the password either on the table or on the receipt. Staff were friendly and more importantly no sign of impatience or pressure to leave the cafe even though the group had finish the food for quite some time and got lost in the wonderful conversation. I ordered the Namban Chicken and Classic (check my photo of the menu for more information) and I find them to be my liking for my taste bud. Not the best but decent enough for me to make another trip back to try out the other flavours. Prices is reasonable and portion is definitely value for money.

Lastly, their truffle fries were a bit on the salty side, but full of cheesy truffley goodness. Besides the food, the decor is right up my alley. Clean and modern, wide open spaces and gray and brown accents. Service was super fast, which is another big plus with places that have small menus.

Being at a Bao place. You've got to try the baos right? so i went straight for the shrimp with salted egg yolk one. The bummer was that it was a minimum order of 2 baos, and i really had wanted to sit down and relax and not stuff myself with 2 baos. But i understand the procedure as steaming just one bao would be quite a waste of steam i suppose. so i had to go for the traditional one. The classic ""kong bak"" bao/pork belly. The shrimp one could do with a more stronger salted egg yolk sauce, but all in all, the shrimp was fresh and crisp. As for the pork belly bao, it would be nice if it had a thicker sauce around the meat. The staff here are friendly and would go the extra mile to help. So the next time you're around horne road or going to catch a soccer match at the jalan besar stadium. Come over and get yourself a great cup of coffee and some baos.

It was also filling and I just had one piece of that for dinner. When I was about to leave, I bought the lemon meringue. It wasn't as good as I thought it will be as I consumed it hours later. The second time I came, I had the Raspberry Croissant. The server also heat it up before serving. I asked for a to go bag (brown bag) so that I am able to taste the croissant in bites instead of using fork and knife. The raspberry filling was so amazing. On top of the croissant there were powdered sugar and almond which made it sweet and crunchy. The texture of the flakes was just done perfectly. Service was excellent. The servers will repeat the order of what you are getting one more time for accuracy. They also greet you upon entering this cafe. Every time I come here, people also started to rush inside here to buy other kinds of breads or pastries. They also serve main courses as well as soups. Definitely a good place to hang out during the rainy days or during tea time. Will be back for more soon :)"

It's the smell of butter and sugar probably, both of which i cannot resist and that resulted in a shopping spree when i stumbled into Bread and Hearth, a new artisanal bakery in the Keong Saik/ Chinatown/ Ann Siang area. Bread and Hearth prides themselves with using pure butter and quality ingredient. There is absolutely no shortening used, as highlighted by the friendly staff. French Normandy butter and flour goes into making these quality pastries.The Matcha Orange is a bread roll with a nice matcha fragrance and the flavor is lifted by the refreshing chunky orange peel. The Honey Chocolate bread ($3) was porous and very bouncy. Even though it said Honey Chocolat, it wasn't sweet at all and it actually had a salty taste. That said, i still like how it was flavored nicely with the dark chocolate chip bits. Do add some honey to it after you toast it. I swear it's divine.The Bacon Focaccia ($6.50) is exactly that kinda bread that i'd want for a breakfast. The fragrance was taunting me during work the whole afternoon and i finally succumbed to my weakness and took several bites and boy was it satisfying. It's the perfect savory snack. I would eat the foccacia even if it didn't have bacon on it. The Cream Cheese Sesame ($2.80) turned out to be a sweet treat instead of a savory one! Think dense creamy cheese with a nice sweet pastry crust peppered with smokey sesame seeds. Yummy! Another must try is the Bostock which is more than 50% cake i swear. Bread and Hearth also does sandwiches and coffee and they do have a nice enough spot for lunch/tea."

But being someone who's open to trying new things, I figured I might as well see what the fuss is about.Ah Chiang's has been around for decades, but I'll leave it to the reviews below to talk about its history. When I visited during my lunch break, the place was hopping with locals, both professionals and those who are retired and probably live around the block. Since it's difficult to find a table during peak lunch hour, my colleagues and I did a takeaway order this time around.  The aunties that run the cashier can be a bit brusque, but don't take it personally. Also, if you do takeaway, don't take it personally when they call a number, you know it's not your order, but then they glare at you thinking it is your order, and then when you prove to them it isn't, they start yelling amongst themselves trying to figure out whether a guest isn't listening or if someone on the staff is an idiot for taking the wrong order.I decided to play it safe by just ordering the plain pork porridge (I think it's the 2nd or 3rd one on the menu) which doesn't include intestines, liver or anything your typical Westerner wouldn't eat. Once I got back to the office and tried it (in an air conditioned environment) I didn't think it was half bad. I will have to echo the other reviews in that it is pretty plain, so it's best to take my colleague's advice of adding soy sauce, ginger, and pepper for more taste.However, the price can't be beat. If you include the extra charge for takeaway, it came out to $4.25, and I was unable to finish my bowl."

I've returned for 2 times and counting ever since!One of my colleagues and I always order their pork balls porridge, which is THE BEST of the lot. Also, chinese sashimi (raw fish) is a pretty acquired taste and way more fishy than the Japanese version but the thin slithers of raw fish in soy sauce were good and went well with the porridge! Go for the more expensive version if you can though. We also had some fried fish skin once, which was very salty on its own but nice when eaten alternately with porridge.(I daresay that this place actually rivals the more popular Zhen Zhen porridge at Maxwell... probably my favourite porridge place in Singapore at the moment)Haven't been here for awhile as my workplace has changed but I'll come back here regularly when I'm posted for work near the area!"

Add extra soy sauce, smother it in pepper, and you're good to go.They're also really popular for their other dishes like their tofu in Thai-like chili sauce, their raw fish (that I confess I've never dared to try), and a few other things that I've noticed other people ordering but never really felt like indulging.The porridge though is solid. It's hearty, nourishing, and when hot, thick. Once it cools down it does get kinda watery, so do try to eat it fast for maximum enjoyment. Taking away costs extra, but gives the raw egg a little extra time to cook (as long as you're not carrying it too far away) for that perfect soft boiled consistency.The soya milk is a bit on the overly sweet side, so I don't really recommend it... but if you like sweet then.

The were benches outside for waiting and an organised queue system which eased the wait. We had the banana bread ($15) which had been widely raved about by many bloggers and cafe goers. The bread was soft and moist and paired well with the yogurt and nuts, but was nothing extraordinary and was a bit steep for its price tag of $15. A plus point would be that it was not too sweet and hence rather easy on the palate. For dessert, the sticky date pudding was a pleasant end to the meal. In fact, I'd say skip the banana bread and have this instead. The sticky date pudding pairs well with the vanilla bean ice cream and the degree of sweetness depends on the amount of syrup you choose to dip your pudding in. Warm and sweet, it'd definitely satisfy those with a sweet tooth!The coffee was particularly disappointing. With beans from sarnies, it failed to provide the kick the usual Joe from sarnies does and lacked depth. It was also rather acidic with a distinct difference between the milk and espresso, failing to come together as a whole.Overall, a nice place to try if you're in the area, but personally not worth the wait given it's higher price tag and the availability of better options in the vicinity."

Though the entrance was huge, somehow we couldn't see it. The three of us stood outside Gothe Institut scratching our heads, where's The Lokal?A quick phone call and one of the service staff came out to ""pick us"". Somehow the diagonal entrance escaped our eyes. Walking into the cafe, it was fairly empty. At around 7pm, there were only 2 tables filled. The full fledged bar welcomes us as we entered then the open kitchen at the back. As we had made reservations, we were seated where the nice cushion seats were. Tucked in a cosy corner, it was the perfect place for 3 girls to hangout and share our hearts out.The menu came and we were told that the mains & appetizers are changed regularly. Since we decided on a side of truffle chips, we gave the appetizers a miss and ordered our mains. Recommendations from the service staff were the pork belly with Apple sauce and lamb shank in crispy wrap with cous cous. We ordered 2 pork belly and a lamb. To conclude our meal, we had the Sticky date pudding.The Truffle chips were served first, pipping hot with a huge serving of shredded cheese on top. The fragrance of the truffle oil was immense, totally tickled our nostrils.The pork belly was tender and literally melts in your mouth. The sweetness of the apple sauce nicely complemented the pork belly, lifting the palette from pleasure to joy. The portion was a little too much for me but a regular dude would have consumed it completely in glee. I didn't get to taste the lamb but I to say that it's not for the faint-hearted. The lamb is pungent (not in a bad way) so non-lamb lovers, beware. Now comes the sticky date pudding, the divine one that we all three swore we will be back when we need a pick-me-up. Rich and thick dark caramel sauce, coupled with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a really warm pudding, our tongue was dancing between the sensation of hot and cold and the sweetness from the sauce was balanced nicely with the ice cream. The pudding was moist and lovely.Dinner ended on a high note as we leave and were sent off with ""thank you""s from the staff. So coming back for the sticky date pudding!"

Caught a little break at work and checked out the new kid on the block, The Lokal in the Duxton area. This new cafe on Neil Road is the offspring of Sarnies, another crazy packed cafe that I've yet to try (ZOMG call myself a food blogger).Well The Lokal checked off all the boxes on the hipster cafe checklist and they even went as far as to throw in a $40k Slayer machine. Oh that sexy beast took me on an intense ride with his latte ($5.50) and I must say it was all very smooth. And a little nutty too. The beans are from Sarnies and they have their barista consultant, affectionately known as the K Man, who is overseeing the coffee making for now. Many would go for the signature Veal Schnitzel Burger ($28) served with a tangy grilled pineapple and red slaw but we skipped that because chunky chips weren't available that day! Instead, i opted for the Roast Beef on Rye ($17). The sandwich was a combination of perfectly caramelized onion and thinly sliced sautéed beef. The flavors were a little sweet and could be sharpened with a stronger mustard than the current grain mustard crème fraiche. It was a good roast beef sandwich nonetheless.The Roast Chicken Panini ($15) was good too. The filling included huge juicy slices of fresh tomato (not the cheapo Malaysian sort), copious amount of avocado mash, crispy pancetta and salty roast chicken meat. The bread was our favorite among the lot of sandwiches we had, partly because it's a little more pillowy and chewy. A healthier option is the Smashed Avocado with Ricotta Sourdough ($18). The ricotta is made in house, along with their yogurt as well. It was simply topped with some pomelo and almonds, drizzled with olive oil. I liked the separate components of the dish but it came together rather plainly. A touch of honey could make this a better dish in my opinion but that's just my preference. I was looking forward to the Banana bread with Hokey Pokey ice cream ($12) but was sorely disappointed when I bit into the soggy bread cloyingly soaked by the citrusy syrup. We wondered where the ice cream went to as well (i swear i didn't take forever to grab a shot). Instead we had a sour cream sorta mixture on our dish. I couldn't bear more than a full bite of this one but K had no issue finishing it for us.Overall, The Lokal is a decent place for a hearty sandwich and it's probably going to be really packed on the weekends. A little bird told me that the Sarnies people are gonna be opening another cafe soon so do watch out for them!"

Overall it's too big and there's too little slipper lobster. It's about 80% purple slaw and 20% slipper lobster. Just imagine getting slipper lobster 1 in every 5 bites. The slipper lobster was kind of tasteless and the roll was too huge and just a glorified hotdog bun. The handcut fries were excellent, though one wouldn't come back just for the fries, would one."

Pardon me if I sound really jaded but... it's all starting to look the same? The slightly-deconstructed interiors, the limited brunch menu, the old-school plates and cups... same old, same old. With more than a hundred of such cafes dotting our little island (all springing like wildflowers in the past 3 years or so), it's starting to get a bit dated, and standing out is becoming somewhat challenging for all these cafes. Unfortunately, The Lokal fits into the typical mold of all the new wave of hipster cafes. I'd like to be more excited, but after visiting this place for today's Yelp brunch... I just didn't find anything that would make it stand out. Not to say that it's bad, it's OKAY, a DECENT but not fantastic place to have a meal.I ordered the roast chicken panini with a smoked salmon side. The smoked salmon was alright, though a bit cold (one of my dining companions thought that it was okay though). The sandwich came stuffed with the chicken, strips of crispy bacon, tomatoes and avocadoes. The vegetables tasted alright (tomatoes were better than other places... say, Subway), the chicken was sufficiently moist, the bacon was crispy but had no taste. We went in a group of 14 and sampled a good proportion of the (smallish) menu - the overall verdict was that it was ok, but nothing to shout about.I had a mocha. It was ok, not bad, but again- not amazing.The best part was probably the sticky date pudding, which was yummy and quickly gobbled up by one of the kids!Prices are reasonable and portions are decently-sized. My meal came up to slightly below $20 for a sandwich and a coffee, and I felt satiated at the end (although I wasn't satisfied). Verdict? It's alright if you happen to be in the area, but not worth traveling for."

All of the Greek places I tried before this place seemed to me that they were serving middle eastern food poorly prepared. This place is different!We went with the mixed meat platter for two and everything they had was good. I specially enjoyed the spiciness of the beef sausage and also enjoyed the lamb chop the most. The meatball is really good as well. The chicken yorio and the kebab are ok but nothing special. The portion is good for two people and you should order one starter if you aren't planning to eat dessert. We opted to eat dessert and ordered baklava and they gave us Greek yogurt on the House. The baklava was just ok nothing special. I would skip dessert next time but the meat there was really good.Highly recommend you reserve a table given it was fully reserved when we arrived and sat on the bar side

After some quick research by the wife, we discovered that they've ventured out to open Bakalaki Greek Taverna at Seng Poh Road and we knew that we had to head down to give it a try. First impressions. It felt like being home again. The warm greeting from George and Christos is always something to look forward to and we loved how Bakalaki felt a lot like the original place at Upper Bukit Timah (with a lot more space). Saganaki Kefalotyri ($16.90)This simple looking dish has always been one of my favourite. This beautifully pan fried Kefalotyri is not overly salty and melting with goodness. Topped with a squeeze of lemon and it brings out the richness and flavours of the cheese wonderfully. Perffffferrcccctttttt! Best eaten hot! Horiatiki ($20.90)Definitely one of the best Traditional Greek salad around. The wife who doesn't normally enjoy raw salads really love the Greek salad here. The Cherry tomatoes used are amazingly sweet, mixed with the freshness of the cucumber, pungent-ness of the onions, the saltiness of the olives, creaminess of the feta and the brightness of lemon juice made this salad an absolute delight to have! Pita Bread ($2.90)The pitas here don't look like much but they are so so good. Light, almost fluffy, they go absolutely perfect with the dips (5 different dips) that are available. That hint of salt added a nice dimension to the pita while the oregano gave it a nice, earthiness to the pita.Dips ($14.90 - $15.90 for single portions or $16.90 for 2 half portions)We went with the 2 half portions for the variety and tried their Taramosalata (Cod roe dip) and the classic Tzatziki (cucumber and Greek yogurt). A little strange not seeing Hummus on the menu but at least it got us trying something different. The tzatziki was fantastic. Light, refreshing and a real palette cleanser as we moved from dish to dish. The Taranosalata on the other hand really packed it punch! It was wonderfully rich, salty yet had this brightness to it because of the lemon juice. And I might get murdered for this but it went perfectly well with not only the pita but with the potato and grilled octopus tentacles. Paidakia ($32.90 for 3 pieces) The lamp chops here are a must have and a favourite here. The lamp is wonderfully marinated, ensuring that, for the lesser fans of lamb, there isn't that overpowering smell of lamb. It's perfectly seasoned and the knife cuts through the meat like butter. It had the perfect amount of meat to fat ratio, ensuring the lamb chops remain juicy and succulent. For those who used to frequent the old place and know how good the lamb is, the ones here are as fantastic!Htapodi ($32.90)Another favourite and must have is the grilled octopus tentacles. A lot of love and care goes into cooking octopus tentacles (legs), ensuring that they come on tender and succulent. Grilling them alone isn't enough and it often takes and hour or so of braising. The octopus here doesn't get any more perfect. Juicy, succulent, tender, it is absolute bursting with the flavours of the mediterranean.  A must have, whether you're a regular or visiting for the first time. Thanks to Christos, we managed to try 2 new desserts on their menu.Rizogalo ($11.90)This creamy rice pudding was really quite a surprise. It looked really heavy but was actually very light, not overly sweet and perfect after a flavourful meal. Loukoumades ($14.90)Little puffs of sunshine. These little traditional Greek doughnuts and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Drizzled with honey and dipped in the chocolate at the side, it brought a little burst of happiness with every bite. Overall, I loved the hospitality of Bakalaki. It feels like you're being welcomed to a great big Greek family dinner every time you're there. The ambience is very nice and open and with a fairly open concept, it doesn't feel stuffy or stifling and makes for a very comfortable dining experience."

The food and service were both impeccable and left me in high spirits the rest of the day. I especially enjoyed the grilled octopus, which was juicy, soft and flavourful! The dips were also nicely paired with the warm toasted pita bread that was peppered with some herbs and coarse salt. The house wines added a nice touch to the meal as well."

Signature Greek items were very well executed - the taramosalata was rich and creamy without being overpowering. Of the items we ordered, we thought that Bakalaki did a better job on some while Blu Kouzina (the other Greek restaurant) did a better job on others. Overall, high-quality food.The service, however, was abysmal. I would have written it off if the poor service occurred once, but it happened four times - it was difficult to get anyone's attention to (a) get water refilled, (b) order additional items, (c) ask for the dessert menu, (d) pay.In fact, there were a few occasions where some staff walked by us to the shelves near to where we were sitting to do their thing, and they seemed to take extra care to avoid eye contact with me. The unnecessary delays added up and by the time we received the dessert menu, we decided to skip dessert.One possibility is that we were seated near a large group and the waiters were busy with that group. However, the maitre d should have assigned waiters accordingly. At Bakalaki's price point, this level of service was not acceptable."

We made reservations more than 2 weeks in advance for a special occasion for 10 people. Yet, when our party arrived (10 minutes earlier than reservation time), our table had been given away. We knew this because we were told that our table was prepared but they were accidentally given away to a group of tourists. We had to wait for tables to be vacated, cleaned, set. We were initially squeezed into 2 tables, that was then extended to 3 when some other diners left. The service recovery was poor.

The skin to wrap the ingredients was light yet not too delicate and the taste reminded me of the wrapping of an old school Hong Kong sweet snack. You are presented with a range of condiments to go inside the wrap ... and the whole experience is exemplified with a step by step instruction card that is a cute and nice touch. We also had their bak kut teh. It was slightly different to the usual style, the soup was tasty but heavier than usual, but the rib was soft and succulent and just fell off the bone!Another dish worth mentioning is the chicken. It was succulent and juicy, and was stuffed with rice in a dark marinate with bits of veggies and Chinese mushroom. Super tasty!A Kailan with Kale side was interesting ... the two types of kales coming together, served cold in a delicious sauce. The cocktails were good - my Lady Luck came in a fancy cup of a lady's head. My friend had a Kopi Cat - it was delicious, basically a kopi with vodka. Yum. Highly recommend - I don't give 5s often!"

The food fell in two buckets, very good and very meh, which put me on the fence given that this is a fine dining restaurant AND I have enjoyed Willin's food at Wild Rocket back in the day.Our meal started of course with the signature dish, Popiah. The skin was really, really soft and just flexible enough that a clumsy person like me could roll my own popiah and not tear it. Ok I lied. I ripped my popiah right down the center, but i ate it anyway because I don't know, it cost $58?! The chilli and stewed pork filling, which I would argue make or break the dish, did the job but lacked any kick. I mean this could have been a knock your socks off starter, but it tasted more like a dish I'd use to introduce Western friend's to local cuisine.What should've been our knock-your-socks-off starter was the charcoal grilled Iberico satay. Oh em gee. Now THIS, this giant succulent skewer chock full of slightly fatty pork, marinated in spices and then grilled, was just perfect. One of the best satays I've eaten and here's looking at you, Violet Oon at National Gallery. Next we had the barramundi salad, which was basically a yusheng plated to look like a garden with flowers. Very fresh fish, good dash of citrus and oils and aromatic flowers. Light and refreshing on the palate before the next porky dish, which was Kurubota char siew. Oh this had so much promise as it looked like the strips at Char and mm that Cantonese restauarant near Keong Siak. Alas this plate had some of the natural juiciness one would expect from Kurubota,  but it didn't have enough fat to take things to the next level. I really was disappointed since the plate was set right in front of me. Fight over the satays we did, but not the char siew.For mains, the standout by a mile was the prawn mee. It had these large chargrilled prawns sitting on pork laced, Hokkien mee style noodles that were just wet enough to slop on your plate and gobble down. Really really really really good. I was also looking forward to the paper spring chicken since it had glutinous rice stuffed in it, but it turned out very dry - makes sense because turkeys cooked with stuffing also get dried out and I imagine a smaller bird would have had a better chance with wet aromatics in the cavity and the rice steamed separately. Veal cheek rendang was also another meh dish - not exactly flavorful or falling apart at the touch of a fork. Why liddat?! Lastly the sambal forrest mushrooms were...fried mushrooms with sambal. Interesting combo, liked the sambal (so why couldn't the popiah chilli have more kick?). After eating pretty much the whole menu, we got what was incorrectly described as ""Goreng pisang with gula melaka gelato"". Gula melaka gelato....step right up! I actually tahaned a whole 20 mins more of conversation just for the dessert, only the realize what the menu meant was ""Goreng pisang, drizzled with gula melaka sauce AND gelato"". Haiyaaaaa. Anyway it was still a cool dessert - the goreng pisang was covered in those Chinese rice krispie thingies and fried, drizzled lightly with gula melaka  and then plopped on ice cream. It was delicious, lots of different textures and looked unusual.So there you have it. If I were to eat at Po again I would go straight for the satay, prawn mee and barramundi yu sheng. Drink wise I only got to try the whiskey based cocktail that comes in a bottle - it was quite well mixed though there was an overwhelming taste of caramel instead of banana and bitters. Stronger than it tasted so I enjoyed the kick. All in all, the restaurant was buzzing, some of the dishes were great but you're definitely paying up for it."

Nevertheless, still a great staple in most brewhouses!2. Roasted Duck with Cabbage and Potato Dumpling $18++ *Highly Recommended*This was my favourite dish as the duck was so tender! A signature Czech dish with traditional ingredients, the cabbage was also mildly sour with a good mix of juiciness.3. Chicken Paprikash $16++At first, I had mistakened this for a curry chicken with rice! The chicken itself was a bit bland but together with the delicious creamy sous, it was rather delightful.4. Beef Goulash $16++This is a traditional Czech pub food. The beef chunks are slow-cooked for hours with Czech spices till the stew becomes aromatic. The beef here were sizable chunks but didn't have the melt in your mouth texture I had expected. The stew was very flavourful though!Overall : Prague Microbrewery and Restaurant is the first of it's kind in Singapore that is very authentic and sincere in both their drinks and food.

For dessert we had the basque burnt cheesecake, the only item which I felt was a bit of a let down, didn't find it that different from a normal cheesecake (although it was still tasty). Had hoped for a flavor of more Spanish cheese in it. Even though, its a superb place to try out Spanish cuisine in Singapore!"

Prefer the bar over their restaurant. Looks like you need a reservation for the bar also now. Before it was just first come first served.Surprised I haven't written a review about Binomio yet. I could have sworn I did.Sounds like praises have been sung by the other reviews already. Just co-signing here.Really like the Larios 12 gin & tonic they make with juniper berries. It's a steal at $14 per drink.Their 6 for $69 tapas tasting menu (or 9 for $99) is quite a great deal for the quality and amount of food you get. It also lets you explore their tapas menu. There's a surcharge for starred menu items but still worth it!Awesome place to relax over a couple of good drinks and nosh. Check it out.

Good ambience and service was good, food was tasty without being spectacular. For tapas we had crab empanadas, pulpo (my favourite), scallops, and finished with a squid ink paella for main. Empanada pastry was a bit too thick and doughy for my liking but crab filling was certainly tasty. A bit disappointed when the head waiter said they looked like ""curry puffs"" when describing the specials, and didn't seem to know what I was referring to when I asked if they were empanadas. Pulpo was delicious. Squid was beautifully tender. Scallops were really disappointing. For such a pricy dish I couldn't believe they sliced the scallops in half meaning we effectively only got 2 scallops. Give us 4 whole ones for $25!Paella was tasty enough though again incredibly stingy with the proteins (seafood). Overall a nice place in a nice area, but couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed when leaving."

Bunuelos de chocolate Chocolate fritters with sorbet. Pretty standard. Think fried doughnut balls dipped in chocolate. The service- Overall was good. Chef Alonso personally serves the Paella and spends time chatting with the guests.

We chose the 6 tapas tasting menu (such a steal at a mere S$69, compared to all the other swanky tapas bars in Singapore), and went with all of the waiter's recommendations. Every dish was presented so beautifully and they were delicious. My favourites - Croquetas de Champinones, Pulpo a la gallega and Huevos Binomio. We were so happy with the selection, and everything was perfect until our paella arrived. Thinking tapas wouldn't be filling enough (they were), we had ordered their Arroz Negro (squid ink paella). Not only was it too salty and unappetizing, especially compared with the tapas we just had, it cost us more than the 6 tapas tasting menu! We were all bewildered. We'll definitely be back at the tapas bar! The 6 tapas ordered was sufficient for the 3 of us, but I think I'll be greedy next time and go with the 8 tapas tasting menu. Or more.. They were just so yummy! Perhaps we'll try something else from their dining menu too! Just not the squid ink paella. Snuck in a corner of Craig Road without too much traffic, noise or people, the place was just what we needed for a chillaxing Friday night."

The restaurant dishes were, in my opinion, a tad tastier and fancier than the bar offerings, but does not warrant the difference in price tag. A typical bar tapas is about 6-10 bucks whereas for the restaurant, it's about 15-40, albeit the portions being slightly bigger. I like the bar because you can get many tapas without hurting your wallet. The tapas are generally tasty, made with good ingredients. The entrocote was really good, as well as the pan con tomate, the shrimps and the bone marrow. Will be back. P.S: Wine by the glass is a meagre pour, so get a bottle."

Ill or not, the show must go on.Binomio is designed with a tapas bar in front and an elegant dining room at the back. We made reservations and some requests earlier on and the service manager was obliging. We had the mushroom croquettes, grilled squid, crayfish and pork belly as tapas starters. We crayfish and croquettes were excellent, but the squid and pork belly  weren't particularly interesting. We then had a giant pan of squid ink paella to share and it was very well done. We would have liked to have more charred rice bits but that's just me being picky. For mains, we had a suckling pig, the fish and I had the lamb chops. The suckling pig wasn't quite as mind blowing as the ones we've had in Barcelona or Segovia, but it was still good. I also thought my lamb chops were executed well as they were juicy and charred at the bone.

We had the regular kaya combo with kopi, and one French toast variation with tea.The toast was nice with the right amount of butter and kaya, and the french toast was delicious (some argued that it is too dry which I cannot confirm). The eggs were quite runny, thus my husband did not touch them and I guess this might be a no-go to a lot of (European) people.What I like about this place? The traditional feel, the many locals, the good food (apart maybe from the egg-situation) low cost (we paid 11 S$), and the option to sit outside under the fans (tables there might be quite dirty when it is busy). What I don't like? The ignorant attitude by some of the girls working there. Yes, we do not speak Chinese, but ignoring requests and stomping off does not help. We are nice people, and my husband is the most polite and friendliest person I know, however when he asked for more toast, twice, he got blank stares or was plainly ignored by the female staff, just left standing.Thus, although I liked the place initially, I might not visit again."

To be honest, while it was good, it didn't blow me away. I felt like the toast came out cold, like it had been sitting waiting for me. The butter was cold (as is the style, I think) and a kind of thin application of kaya. I skipped the eggs, not being an egg guy, which confused the staff, apparently not ordering a ""set"" of kaya toast, soft boiled eggs, and kopi is unusual. That said, the kopi-C was probably the best I had while I was in Singapore. Very rich, not overly sweet...I came here on my first morning for my first meal, and it started a love affair, that's for sure. And as with most other small places I ate in Singapore, it's amazingly cheap, just a few dollars."

The crunch is good on this though. 2) chicken clay pot: another famous dish of theirs, I enjoyed it. 3) tofu with minced meat: loved this dish!!

You occupy one location as a kopi tiam for 75 years, hand down recipes, grill grease and oven char generation after generation, basically watch Keong Saik go from a dirty road of prostitution to Singapore's new ""it"" street while still continuing to pump out fast, cheap and flavorful dishes and some of the best kopi and kaya I've ever had, and then you get forced to up and move to a new spot and are expected to pick up right where you left off?

To be honest, I wasn't that hungry but I didn't want to let a minute go to waste since I don't make it to SG that often. I was staying in Chinatown and had arrived earlier that day, so I figured I would eat close to my hotel in case the sun became too much.Chinatown is full of shops and dumplings. Unfortunately, it is also full of tourists.I did my best to avoid tourists and found a small dumpling shop hidden behind a construction zone. I figure the construction zone is not usual because the the shop, Jing Hua Xiao Chi, had been featured multiple times on various ""Best Dumplings"" lists. Okay, so it wasn't the hidden gem I was hoping for but it was definitely not riddled with tourists and that was good enough for me!The walls were red and tastefully (pun intended) decorated with photos of dumplings. Overall the shop was small and fairly empty. I didn't spot a single tourist out of the three groups that were in the restaurant. The staff was nice and sat me quickly and a menu and ordering pad were waiting for me at the table.I was running short on cash and Jing Hua didn't take cards (for the amount I spent.) Fortunately, the dumplings weren't too expensive. After entering the shop, I immediately looked at the menu to see what drinks they had. I needed something refreshing after a short walk that seemed to take an eternity. I noticed they had a Mango Juice on the menu for $3 ($2.20 USD) and I went for it. It was more than I would prefer to spend on a drink but this kind of stuff goes for $10 in California, plus I was desperate.I wanted to check every box on the menu but remembered the minimal cash I had in my wallet and decided to go with the classic Xiao Long Bao for $8 ($5.88 USD) an honest steal compared to SF prices. I've had many a Xiao Long Bao and part of me wanted to try one of the pan fried dumplings, but alas, I decided to play it safe and go with a fan favorite.The Mango Juice was just what I needed. It was refreshing and slightly thick. If it wasn't made of real mango it certainly had me fooled. There was an odd touch of rose water but it grew on me and I downed the whole thing pretty much before the dumplings came. I don't even like mango, but I liked this.Not long after the Mango Juice arrived, a plate of steaming-hot dumplings was placed right in front of me. I was so excited but slightly nervous because I didn't want to be disappointed by this apparently-famous dumpling house. The classic soy/vinegar dumpling sauce was already on the table so I poured myself a saucer-full and placed a single dumpling into the saucer to soak and cool a bit.What happened next was incredible. The dumpling was still hot but I couldn't wait any longer. I put it in my mouth and felt the soup flow in my mouth as I chewed. It was a mix of soy, vinegar, pork juices and sesame. I think the sesame part was pretty unique but maybe that's just how they do it in Singapore. Whatever the reason, I am happy they discovered this combination of flavors because it was a true delight and I would definitely go back.I wolfed down the seven dumplings, walked up to the front of the shop and paid. In case it wasn't clear, I was one happy customer.If you spend enough money, they take Visa. Pay at the front.Total Cost: $13.30 ($9.77 USD)21 Neil RdSingaporeThis post is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews"

I never walk along this side of Neil Road but one Sunday in search of food or anything even open worth trying around this area, I stumbled upon Jing Hua. It was open, air conditioned, and there wasn't a crowd so I thought I'd give it a try.I was surprised at the number of Yelp reviews mostly raving about Jing Hua. I cracked up as I read through a number of the reviews while ordering and eating my meal. I especially cracked up at Ida's review as there was a twist to the ending where she ordered all that food for herself! I did the same and didn't feel bad about it after seeing her review, haha.The xiao long bao are very good. On par with DTF I'd say. I really enjoyed my hot and sour noodle soup. It's just like regular hot and sour soup but with a nice thick udon-y noodle to help balance out soup with some carbs.The lotus pancake was awesome also. Not the healthiest as it's deep fried but the skin was crispy to perfection and the lotus inside was subtly sweet and added a good gooey texture to go with the crispy skin. I took half home for breakfast the next morning and although not as good fresh, it was still semi-crispy and enjoyable.I'll be back Jing Hua!"

The veggies are also very simple: stir-fried in garlic but $8 for a small portion. Come here if you're really, REALLY craving old-style, mama homemade kind of dumplings.

This is both a good and bad sign; the good thing is that the skin is delicate and the bad sign is that I am too rowdy with this plump meaty babies.These  Xiao Long Baos ($7++ for 7pcs) are near perfect--the ball of minced pork at the center, loose and yielding, as if itself in midmelt. My 2nd XLB landed in my spoon intact and buoyant, and I popped the entire thing comfortably in my mouth. There could be a little more of that liquefied pork gelatin but I'm just being greedy. Other dumplings variations include the steamed vegetarian dumplings stuffed with taupok bits and crunchy turnips which even non-vegetarians will delight. The Seafood and Pork Dumplings had a slightly chewy feel but the ingredients tasted fresh and not too greasy. I prefer the pan-fried version ($8++ for 10 pieces) which transformed the original chewy skin into delicate crunchy bites with tantalizing burnt aroma. This gives the pan-fried dumpling more character, as if it was a  golden pillow case Perfect if there were more chives. The mastery achievement goes beyond the dumplings to the noodles and the desserts. The Noodle with Minced Pork & Soya Bean Sauce 炸酱面 ($5++), is wonderfully alchemized by the minced pork and age-old calculus soya bean paste that Iess salty than other specimens. The Osmanthus soup with glutinous rice ball soup ($3++) arrived hot and fragrant with warm floral inhalations. Hand-made with a spot-on dough-to-filling ratio, each tiny pop is rolled with a different flavour; lotus and walnut, black sesame, red bean and peanuts.  Another must-try is the Crispy Red Bean Pancake ($10++) that is prepared freshly upon order. Expertly deep-fried till they are like crunchy fritters, the dark brown parcels oozes dense, sweet red bean paste with charred sesame aroma. After such a satisfying meal, I am convinced that the Han's decision to leave the menu unchanged for 25 years was a right one. Consistent quality food that can stand the test of time.

However, by focusing on just a few, they've really boiled it down to the dishes they've best at and famous for, and everything is absolutely delicious, although I am not a fan of the Chinese pizza. The xiao long bao are not as dainty and refined as the ones you would find elsewhere, but they are hearty and pack great flavour. My personal favourite dish, however, is their pan-fried dumpling.

I had been told there would be a wait at all hours, bad service but the most ridiculously delicious dumplings in Singapore. Well, the service was actually decent and attentive by both Singapore and authentic Chinese restaurant standards (I can't say which is supposed to be worse). I didn't encounter the grumpy boss and we were seated immediately.We ordered the xiao long bao, guo tie, spinach with oyster sauce, zha jiang mian and red bean pancake. The xiao long bao was as it should be, meaning perfectly hot with lots of soup inside and a good amount of pork and seafood. Divine. The guo tie was similarly awesome - fried to crisp but served on a dry plate with none of that leaky oil puddle crap you get at alot of la mian hawker stalls. The spinach dish was generous and not salty at all and the zha jiang mian, oh what mian. Soft noodles, bowl-lickin' sauce and a good dash of crisp cucumber shreds and spinach.There was nothing bad to say about our experience (well maybe the $0.60 I had to pay for unused wet towels that couldn't be returned) and I intend to return many more times.

Finally got a Tiger Beer ($9.60/ lg bottle) which was unusually frosty.It is a pity the Chinese Pizza was not available, worth trying next time. If they can also add-in the GST to the prices, it would make it a bit more honest."

Their steamed xiao long baos, and pretty much all kinds of dumplings have the same shrimp pork filling, which has a delicate seafood sweetness to it, especially in the xiao long baos. This taste is distinctly lighter than the taste offered in places such as din tai fung or paradise dynasty, so you don't get the ""urgh too much pork oil"" kinda fullness at the end of the meal. Noteworthy is their minced meat noodles. Very starchy, very flavorful, and I love the chinese spinach that comes with it. Also, their ginger is sweet and tasty, and the vinegar has a hint of sweetness that I like. Last, but definitely not least, the red bean pancake was delicious. The crust is slightly crispy and sticky (think fried nian gao), and the red bean is not overly sweet. Just nice. Yum!"

The other couple sitting at our table recommended the pan fried guo tie over the xiao long bao (!!)Anyway, thankfully we got here somewhat early and didn't have to wait. We did have to share a table though, but that turned out for the better! More on that later.Ordered:1. Xiao long bao ($7.50) - had heard so much about these famed dumplings and so had to try them! What was amazing was that the skin was really springy/chewy and did NOT break, nor was there much fear that it would! This is very very rare. Quite a bit of soup inside, bf remarked that it is a lighter taste than one would find maybe at Din Tai Fung or something. Later he expounded upon this saying that if you eat it at one gulp, there's more flavour. 2. Zha Jiang Mian - pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing. Quite addictive though!3. Red bean pancake aka guo bing ($9) - here is where our lovely table companion couple came in. They had ordered one (whereas we'd waited to place the dessert order, just in case) and it looked pretty big, with 14 pieces I believe. I very much doubted that the bf and I would be able to finish one on our own (nor would it be a very good idea), and these deep fried things are just never as good reheated. Especially without the aid of a toaster oven! So, I nudged the bf to ask if they'd consider sharing it (since I also doubted they would be finishing it on their own). He did ask, and they said okay! Yay :) I didn't like it so much, it was really crispy on the outside but rather chewy on the inside (this, the bf liked - he likes chewy stuff). I would've just preferred more crisp. Anyway, it just led me to realize that their specialty seems to be making things chewy (read: the dumpling skin, the pancake skin). Back to the pancake - it had substantial red bean filling which wasn't too sweet, that's a plus!As another Yelper mentioned, compulsory $1.60 tagged on for the wet towels and peanuts (non-returnable because they don't charge service charge)."

The Peranakan 'sauce' was sour, spicy, and sweet, and complimented the squares of cod (juicy, fresh, meaty) perfectly, and the Duck was fragrant, well-roasted and I was so, so tempted to swallow the fat as well (thankfully, I resisted).

The pork rib has been de-boned and cooked in a tangy-sweet sauce. We all loved it especially eating it with the crispy yam strip. We then had the Deep fried prawns with Orange sauce.The sweet and sour taste brought out the freshness of the prawns. Our last dish was the Broccoli fried with Deer meat in Honey sauce.

Not sure how that marriage is working out for them but the Italian-Japanese fusion thing Chef Seita Nakahara has going on at Terra is quite extraordinary. We showed up at 7:30 sharp and was greeted with a ""hello, what is the reservation name under?"". The hostess guided us to the table and asked all the appropriate questions to ensure a pleasant dining experience. The hostess returned to the table with a tray full of lobsters, crabs, oysters, giant prawns, tomatoes, etc. highlighting all things Japanese with the only exception being the Australian truffles. Appreciated seeing the freshness in the raw ingredients and made the anticipation all the more fun. The dining room was cozy and tastefully decorated. We were indecisive with the menu and settled for the omakase, but sneaked in our general preferences to the chef. I'm happy to say that the kitchen was more than accommodating. All the dishes were delightful but the highlights were definitely the grilled Saga beef with it's beautiful glossy marbling, and the baked scallop from Salfutu with Japanese mushroom in tomato based sauce. The dishes are clearly Italian but Japanese ingredients are utilized creating a unique and creative cuisine experience. The restaurant's pasta is pretty special too. They are made daily based on techniques learned from chefs in Italy. The pastas are made with the old, wooden pasta machine you will find displayed in the dining room.Chef Seita brings the best ingredients to the dining table every night. The menu is created with products that are from the farmers and fishermen he connected with during his one-year sabbatical travel to Japan. After we polished off our dessert dish, he came out from the kitchen to check in on us and the first thing I noticed was how young he looked. He looked like he should be on a stage belching out some rock song instead of working in a kitchen. He shared about his restaurant concept and said that he was born in Tokyo, worked as a chef all over Italy, but he returned to Singapore because he considers it his home where he was raised. Pretty cool chatting with him and appreciated the time since the restaurant was bustling but that just means he fully trust his crew. The evening service was very cordial and attentive. Water glasses were always filled, napkins always refolded when walked away, new silverware with each dish presented, overall - excellent, non-overbearing attention to service.Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a unique Tokyo-Italian menu to tantalise your tastebuds."

For the uninitiated, Impossible Foods is a US based company that makes plant-based replacement foods for meat and dairy.  Impossible Foods goal is to make delicious foods that have the benefit of meat, but not the negative health benefits on humans and negative environmental associated with livestock products. In short, it is the chance for people like me that do not eat red meat, to enjoy what is supposed to be the most closest thing to meat I can get.  So I was intrigued about the idea of enjoying a big juicy hamburger...albeit all made of plants.  And not a disappointment.  Three Buns is a cool place.  It has super cool music playing like People Under the Stairs & Souls of Mischief.  Seating both inside and out, one space spills into the other, tables are wooden or table top at a bar, the place feels super local and has a play area for kids right out front.  We saw girls here for brunch, we say families with little kids and we saw couples like us.  The vibe is minimal, friendly, environmentally friendly. This was my first Impossible Foods experience, for it is new to Singapore, although sprinkled around a few restaurants on the island.  My plant based burger came at a price...a whopping $27 price tag for the burger alone.  Worth every penny!  This plant based burger looks like a hamburger...juicy drippings, soft meaty texture, delicious!  A meat eater might not know the difference.  The burger itself is not giant, but it was absolutely tasty...from the bun, to the sauce, to the Impossible plant-based burger itself!  I would pay $27 to consume it again.  Now a meat eater would most likely not agree because the price might be intimidating, but for we pescatarians or anyone seeking a healthier option...this burger rocks!Coupled with some truffle cheese fries, a milkshake and a tentative friendly staff, I think Three Buns is the bomb!  Simple, easy, plant-based, local, cool."

With many old folks hanging around drinking beer along with their food, Tian Jin really is not one most young adults will head to. In fact, Chinatown isn't one most people to go to in the first place. But Raffles was on to something good when he decided to put so many Chinese together in a spot because it led to some really good culinary effervescence we get to enjoy today!My brother ordered a bowl of Zha Jiang Mian ($3.80) to fill his hungry stomach after our Saturday French classes. This dish hails from Northern China and is a humble offering of thick wheat noodles topped with ground pork sauteed with Zha Jiang (salty fermented soybean paste) and sliced cucumbers for a good measure.For gyoza lovers, do not look down on the boiled counterpart to your favourite water-grilled bites. Here at Tian Jin Fong Kee, the dumplings ($6 for 10 pieces) have a rich stock which bursts into your mouth with the first bite. With dumplings, the meat to skin proportion is a fine balance but Tian Jin does well by having a good amount of well marinated meat along with the suitably thin skin to match. Move over Din Tai Fung, Tian Jin's pseudo xiaolongbaos are bigger in taste, better in texture and, the best part, cheaper.There's also no missing the gyoza ($6 for 10 pieces) which is my personal favourite. For the uninformed, gyozas are not fried in oil as they may appear to be but rather ""dry-fried"" in water. Hence, they are commonly called potstickers too because of their tendencies to stick to the non-stickiest of non-stick pans due to the cooking method. Because of this cooking method, the gyoza's also retain the juices of their meat while maintaining the chewy bite of the skin."

Think 2 pieces of braised pork belly with some Vege garnish held together by soft taco. Nice but again, small. Chicken Quesadilla - tasty, just wish there's more of it.

In fact, our server asked us about how the food was, and what we thought about the taco (quality, price, etc). We agreed that it was somewhat expensive, but was pretty good nonetheless!My fish taco ($11) was pretty yummy, somewhat charred (and hence salty), but good fish, and nice topping of chipotle mayo (slightly spicy!) and cucumbers (i think?) etc. Got a little messy with fish juices flowing, but not too disastrous :p My friend got the beef taco ($10) and found it somewhat spicy still (low spice tolerance, oops!)We filled up on corn chips + guacamole/roasted tomato salsa ($12). Yum, since I think it's hard to find guacamole in Singapore. I found the taste of the salsa somewhat curious.. couldn't identify what was in it that gave a certain taste. Anyhow, slightly spicy too, not bad!Would like to be back to try the stuffed pepper sometime.. The place definitely started filling up around 7:30pm! Thankfully we got there around 6:30pm so it wasn't too crowded yet.On a side note, luckily our server told us to check the bill - because we got the wrong bill and it was TWICE the amount we spent.. I'm like, we did NOT order any of these things! Even though another server tried to foist two corn orders and a pork taco on me. I'm like.. we're done eating (and have been, for a while), why are you giving me more food.. O.o Thankfully they got us the right bill in the end."

Each taco was awfully tiny and the tortilla was rather dry. The batter on the fish wasn't crunchy, and they skimped on the cabbage. There was an interesting-tasting mango topping on the fish, but it definitely wasn't authentic. I've visited countless taquerias in the state of California and I know what I'm talking about. People, a taco is cheap street food. It's normally US$1.99 per fish taco, and at S$11 + tax + tip per taco, I expected killer taste for that killer price.The ceviche was decent, not overly sour and the seafood was fresh. However they also skimped on the tortilla chips. The Costillas (ribs) were generally forgettable, although tender, the sauce was rather odd, tomatoish and tasted like it came out of a can. The only redeeming thing was the Pastel de Elote Azul, a blue corn cake with agave nectar & mezcal cream. The corn cake was warm and crumbly with the contrasting smooth texture of the cream beside it. However, I wasn't sure if this was something authentic. I also saw a huitlacoche (corn fungus) quesadilla in one of the pictures here on yelp, however I didn't see that on the menu. Don't get me wrong, the drinks are good, food ingredients are higher quality, and the atmosphere is hip (if you're into that kind of thing). For some reason, this place is the current ""in"" spot, filled with expats holding their margaritas. Lucha libre decor aside, the sky-high prices really turned me off. Food is okay if you haven't tried authentic mexican food, but not *that* mind-blowing to warrant this kind of pricing. My wallet felt gutted."

I can't believe I am saying this but thankfully the dishes weren't too tasty for me to break my resolve. I started with a humble fish taco. I've read other reviews that marked it as a ""yummy but overpriced"" item. Overall, it was ok. A bit too small for it to be considered a meal. Definitely an appetizer and a stingy one at that. If you enjoy fish tacos, I would recommend Tanuki raw's. They serve 2 tacos at $15 and they taste better than the ones here :) Lucha Loco's tacos were too wet. Too much hot sauce made the tortilla soggy :( and very messy to eat. The rest of the dishes I nibbled on a bit but nothing really impressed me very much. Yet this place was full house on a Wed night mind you! Amazing. I attribute its success to the beautiful ambiance and location. Duxton Hill is earning a reputation for drawing in the yuppie crowd. A place to be seen and to see. A feast for the eyes but sadly not the taste buds! haha... 1. Fish taco (fried) - Ok. I had better. 2. Pork ribs - Ok. A bit too saucy? Tasted like a ribs with too much BBQ sauce. 3. Truffle quesadilla - Ok4. Guacamole - I didn't mind it but my dinner companions said it didn't have much of a flavor which was true. It basically tasted like an avocado dip. Very little taste of lime, salt or anything else. That being said, I do like my avocados. The dip was moist and fresh. 5. Salsa - HORRIBLE!!! I can't really describe it. It tasted like cheap tomato ketchup. Everyone on the table barely touched it. 6. Blue Corn Cake with agave nectar and mescal cream - PASS! The cake was so dry even the mescal cream could not make it go down any easier. The mescal cream with berries however were a lovely combination. Then again, who doesn't love berries and cream???7. Sangria - Good. Very light and mild. Not much alcohol but I didn't mind it. I wished I tried their Elotes - Mexican street style grilled corn. It looks peppered with interesting seasonings. Maybe one day when I am around the neighborhood and craving corn I'll pop by for a taste. Otherwise, there isn't much else (food wise) that will compel me to go back."

Nonetheless, if I'm looking for tacos, this is definitely the place I'm going to be. Drinks were good, creative, and relatively cheap as well at $15-20.I came here with a group of girlfriends for dinner and some drinks. We all enjoyed our meal, but were surprised to see a $400+ bill. Damn, with only 5 people eating and 1 person ordering 1 drink, what the hell did we order??? With closer inspection, we realized that each time the waitress came and asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa there was an additional $5-7 charge. Thank you for NOT telling us. I'm sorry, if you're going to be asking, please do make sure we understand that there will be an additional charge. Most Italian places do not charge extra for their breads so we definitely didn't expect this to be the case at Lucha Loco. I personally paid over $60 for two tacos and two drinks.

They don't take reservations but the girl on the phone said at 1930 it shouldn't be too bad. Anyway, we got there at 1930 and for 4 of us, the wait was close to an hour. No matter though as there are many cool bars in the area (and we went to the Tippling club to wait which was awesome).When we were finally seated, it was right at the back of the restaurant. While part of the appeal of Lucha Loco is the uptempo vibe, the balance is off in the back corner in that it's almost uncomfortably dark and loud (so you have to strain to read the menus and shout to be heard). In the future I'd probably specify that I want to sit outdoors or near the front and just wait however long it takes.Food wise we got the beef tostadas, chicken quesadillas, pork belly tacos, chips and guac and something else. Yes the portions are somewhat small for the price but really it does feel comparable to other similar restaurants in Singapore. I somehow expected this place to be all show with no substance but was pleasantly surprised. All the food was actually fantastic and the pork belly taco in particular was the standout.Great margaritas and good food - it's definitely worth checking out.random comment - it was weirdly expat dominated to the point where I think we were the only table of locals. Not really a good or bad thing though."

No, I should correct myself and say that it was an extraordinary grilled corn smeared with chilli, mayonaise and cotija cheese that burst out sweet juices in each bite. I never knew a corn could have such a great allure.Since tacos are the first thing that comes to mind for Mexican cuisine, we instinctively picked the Tacos de pesdacos ($11), which is the fish version instead of pork belly, beef or shrimp. Ceviche (raw fish ""cooked"" in lime and lemon juice) was another popular item on many tables but we did not feel like having it that day. The tender chunks of grilled snapper dressed in chipotle mayo was smoky and slightly fiery. Admittedly, the tortilla skin was rather stretchy, but that extra red pepper salsa added a desirable crunch and zest to itI imagined the Crab Tostaditas with habanero, avocado and cucumber ($16) to be crunchy and creamy but somehow the dish did not deliver the taste. They were on the light, bland side.Our favourite was this vegan dish, Chiles Relanos($24), an ugly-looking roasted poblano pepper stuffed with rice, herbs and wild mushrooms. Every spoonful of filling with the heavenly pumpkin sauce simply lifts up your mood. So delicious that I did not mind skipping other meaty mains.As a dessert lover, I was sad to see only two items but ended up extremely pleased with the Pastel de Elote Azul ($14), a crumbly cake made with blue cornmeal topped with mezcal alcohol-spiked whipped cream. (Though it was served after 20min and not 5min as informed by the waiter) Moistened with agave nectar, the cake had a unique coarse texture and a subtle sweetness. Who says good cakes must be light and fluffy? This one is divine--a MUST TRY....To conclude, this is definitely the place to go for some authentic Mexican street food. If you are coming here for a full meal, I recommend that you order the main meal that are larger in portions as prices adds up when you order those small-sized appetizers. Plus, the cocktails here are not to be missed for those who loves drinking. Do go early before the crowd streams in as there is no reservations! Go late for their DJ music and u might meet the man in the mask."

Not to mention most ingredients are probably imported. So no it's not cheap, but its within the range of what I would expect to pay for for a restaurant in this area.Will definitely visit again.

The fish tacos were good, but extremely expensive at over S$10 per taco. Drinks ranged from $15-20+ per drink. Quality was so-so, not great but not terrible. What gives this place a low rating is the ""feeling you've been ripped off"", ie. the waitresses did not inform us that unless the majority of Mexican restaurants, guacamole and salsa are charged at approx $5-7 each time you ask for more guacamole and salsa. You will only get that nice surprise when the bill comes.I believe that if you are charging such premium prices for tacos and food, giving your customers some guac and salsa free of charge sounds normal, even expected.Speaking of guac and salsa, they were both very disappointing. If the owners claim that they are bringing ingredients in from Mexico directly (and hence the higher prices), I would wish that they emulated the more vibrant flavours of the guac and salsa that are served in authentic Mexican establishments.The service- not very attentive, sluggish.

Delicious food.  Fun ambiance tucked in Duxton Hill.  Drinks that warrant a visit on their own (Must try the Passion Fruit Caipiroska - you will not regret it).  Accommodating to large parties.  And perhaps most impressive, given that its in Singapore, outstanding service.Yeah, Yeah, sure I can understand other reviewers position that the prices were a bit high for the amount of food you get.  But, when you factor in the quality, location, and service, I think the prices are pretty on point.

You can tell a place is ""it"" if every other conference social is held there or for the casual observer, just look for the sign mid-week that says sorry this section is closed for a private event. So what does that mean per se?For one, the food is likely to be decent with a one or two stand out dishes that go well with drinks. I mean, that's the barometer for a lot of working folk right? You walk into a bar after work with this *gawsh I need a drink & some super unhealthy flash fried junk* look and proceed to order whatevers on tap and at happy hour prices (because you don't want to spend money on what is essentially becoming water after a hard day's work, literal and metaphorical pun intended) and then something to fill the stomach. I'd add that because I have had the chance to eat decent Mexican, I was also looking out for the One. That One Mexican restaurant that I could gamely say to out-of-towners sells decent Mexican food and hence upholds Singapore's culinary capital status. So what happened when I visited? Well for one I didn't pay for any of the food I ate so I've no idea how much it costs. Though I'll hazard it wasn't cheap given how enthusiastic the server was about putting food on my table so that she could bill my hosts (who were also covering just about half the bar). I really really liked the crab toastadas. Real crab meat, crunchy nacho used as the toastadas base. Excellent. I kind of liked the chorizo taco but that was it. The chicken taco wasn't great and the cheese in the mushroom quesadillas were more limp than crisp. In fact little secret guys, Bather's restaurant near my house does a really delicious simple cheese quesadilla and obviously beats this. I will say though that the nachos and salsa were pretty darn fine. As for the drinks, obviously I helped myself to the lime margarita and it was not bad. The corona was well, corona and since it was a Wednesday I decided not to venture into tequila territory. So is this It? Nope. Will this place last? I honestly can't say 100% yes. Portions weren't that generous and given that my work brethren like this place, I can imagine it isn't worth the price. But for what it's worth... if you're not picking up the tab, you'll have a pretty good time."

I still prefer the usual yellow noodles, but there are lots of orders for the noodles and bee-hoon mix.The amount of ""white"" cooked chicken is pricy for the $7 (inflation and fame?) and is probably less fatty then the usual hainanese chicken rice variety.On the whole, the great taste of the white meat in curry broth is very memorable. Bean sprouts is pleasantly crunchy. Watch the shirt and sleeves or you will be spotted! Not a good idea if you have a meeting next to attend.Sorry no photos here."

There's a reason why this stall at Hong Lim is so popular. Only one offering on their menu, in large or small, with the large having more meat and the option to choose your cut of the chicken. But the small is quite sufficient. You'll get a healthy amount of chicken with your curry and noodles (choose between yellow noodles or bee hoom or get a mix of both), in addition to dou pok, potato, fishcake and bean sprouts - all deliciously soaking up the broth for more flavor. Literally tastes like home and nearly identical to how my aunt makes it, which made me even more homesick. The broth was creamy, flavorful and with just enough of a kick. I usually don't like chicken breast but wow, this was tender and juicy. Be patient as you'll most likely encounter a long line. The locals obviously know what's up and that's def a stamp of approval!"

One day this year, emboldened with a book in hand, I decided to just queue for the heck of it. You could say my curiosity got the better of me - and, now I totally understand the cause for the queue. It must be the curry gravy - you would think having a whole bowl of curry noodles would probably make you feel sick but they have managed to keep the rich coconuty gravy tasty without being too heavy. Then again, maybe it is the chicken? Paired with generous slices of fish cake and potato, the slices of meat are always extra tender. Or maybe it is the chilli paste that they add last that adds another dimension of flavour to the dish?I don't know what it is exactly but thumbs up. Only attempt if you are patient or queue seems sane enough."

It's no fault of the location, because who sits outdoors in the midday sun on one of the hottest days of the year unless you're trying to get a tan or an expat?! While that choice did not make things better, the real reason the meal was extremely average was the overall taste of all the dishes. Of all the items that we ordered, there were two hits and two complete misses. To clarify, I came here for the set lunches which are 25++ for starter, main and tea or coffee. The setting is reminiscent of a cafe by a cobblestone paved street in France and it was one of those days where I needed the peace the memory invoked. The price is fairly reasonable for the quantity. The burratina in the salad showed promise (it does say 'mozzarella bar') but the truffle oil with chickpeas soup was a complete disappointment. It's partly my fault for not asking what kind of chickpea soup but that combination was atrocious and oddly bland coupled with my dislike for truffle. The leaves were a bit old but nothing criminal. Then came my sliced beef main - rather well done, but with disappointing roast potatoes and a tasteless salad as sides. The second main was the fresh pasta, bolognaise, a very salty and overpowering dish that felt too heavy after the first few bites. The coffee and tea at the end was just average, not artisanal or anything.If you're expecting finer cuisine like I was, given the venue and prices, I think you might be left disappointed. However, I've heard the dinners are far better so perhaps I'd change my review some day."

Duxton is a nice chill out area that is not crazy busy. Plus after a whole day of rain, the weather was at a nice cool 24 degrees, perfect for outdoor dining!Menu is not big. Love places where they just focus on what they do well. As the name suggest, this is a mozzarella bar, so this cheese is featured on a whole page of the menu.We started with two types: one wrapped around truffle, arugula and prosciutto. Beautiful. How do you go wrong with a combination like that. The mozzarella goes well with the saltiness of the ham and the bitterness of the leaves..and you are spoilt further with black truffles. Genius.The second one we had was a creamier mozzarella served on top of a bed of grilled zucchini. Delish too as this mozzarella has a much richer taste and texture. A great contrast to the first. We can't decide which one we like better.Main course we had the special of the day: a wagyu beef steak. Done perfectly medium rare, charred on the outside and lightly pink inside. Meat was succulent and moist with a great bite.The second main course is the spaghetti with mussels in a white wine sauce. On first mouth, I thought it was a tad salty. But the sweetness of the seafood broth with lots of garlic and white wine came through as you eat. Their spaghetti is very thin, even thinner than the usual linguine. Almost like an angel hair. Done al dente. Very nice.We ended the meal with dessert. Lemon panda cotta with strawberries in balsamic reduction. The panda cotta is not sweet like some places and really smooth. Yum too.Service was great as we were served by Kirby who recommended everything. After the two appetizers, we basically told him to just get us what he likes most from the menu for the rest of our meal and we ended up leaving very happy."

Unfortunately, no more spaces indoors (or, not much, anyway). Outdoors is pretty, but it's really hot and the fans helped alleviate the heat only slightly. It was a little tougher to get the attention of the servers outside, but as more people sat down that wasn't as bad. I think al fresco in the evening would be really nice though! Lovely setting with the shophouses behind.I was starving by the time we got there (long walk from office :p) and so was very thankful for the bread + olive oil/balsamic vinegar (although somehow I couldn't get at much of the balsamic vinegar :( think it had sunk beneath the oil!). Piping hot from the oven and deliciously crisp on the outside, warm on the inside, and fluffy!!! I love their bread.Both of us had the restaurant week menu. Pan-fried buffalo milk mozzarella wrapped in parma ham. 3 mozzarella balls! Very nice presentation. Parma ham wrapped around each ball with some herbs sprinkled on top, with some rocket and cherry tomato wedge in each little compartment of the 3-part dish. I found the ham a bit slightly (but never really like ham anyway), balsamic reduction that came with was sweet and hence a good foil! I chose the seafood cacciucco while bf had the lambshank. Lamb was tender, falling off the bone with a prod of the fork. Delicious sauce! He said he could taste the cream/butter in the mashed potatoes. I actually didn't find the cacciucco remarkable, but again I don't really have anything much to compare it to. Nice tomato-y broth, light, fair amount of seafood (clams, fish, prawns, squid, all well cooked, not too tough or anything). Two thin slices of toast (rosemary/sea salt sprinkled, I think?) and of course, I mopped up the soup with the rest of the delicious bread!Dessert - red wine pear with mascarpone mousse and chocolate shavings. Delicious! A tad on the sweet side, but nicely poached pear and mousse went together well."

Their burrata and other mozzerellas are definitely worth the trip. We had the classic burrata and the stracciatella with roasted zucchini, and I could've been happy with just those two cheeses and some bread. But on top of that, we also had eggplant parmigiana, which I thought was actually a little too heavy on the cheese and too light on the eggplant. The flavor was still good, though. Finally, for the entree we shared the roast lamb shanks, which were tasty and tender, if a little gamey - but I think lamb shank is pretty much always gamey, right?Aside from the food, the service was knowledgable, fast, and friendly. The lighting and ambiance inside are nice, but something about the acoustics make it really noisy for the size and number of people in that space.

The crab linguine wasn't quite as awesome as my favourite at Kith Cafe but was still pretty great. Probably a little too much sauce smothering, it rendered the dish less than delicate.I also really liked the lamb and the risotto.

The interiors are inspired, too, and they have unique light fixtures and beautiful furniture.They serve Italian cuisine with a focus on mozarella - it appears in lots of the entrees.

The sauce was very good:  flavorful but not heavy. And the serving sizes were satisfying. Now the bad. 1) Service was friendly (I always appreciate that), but terrible. There was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, so it took a long time to get served, we had to ask for things multiple times because he kept forgetting, and some things never came at all. 2) I don't often say this, but the gnocchi was too firm. Almost rubbery. 3) I ordered the squash risotto, and found it completely flavorless and a bit chalky. 4) Worst of all, we ordered two mozzarella dishes and they tasted like Philadelphia cream cheese.

We thought it was strange that the tabbouleh, fried cauliflower and remaining bread hadn't arrived, so we asked the server about it. He never got back to us. We asked again when a few other dishes came, and still did not get an answer about the appetizers. An hour later we got fed up with the service, and told the staff to cancel the rest of the dishes and get us the bill. He left without a word and got us the bill - didn't bother to check what happened, didn't bother to apologize, and acted as if this was a regular occurrence.

It came with a side of sweet potato fries and coleslaw. Normally, I'm not a fan of either of these sides because of their oily, mayonais-y aftertaste but Afterglow's healthy spin made me simply love them!  The main menu offers Raw Lasagne (priced for $20) but the waitress strongly suggested that we try the ""Today's special's: Raw Crispy Lasagne"", which has a extra layer of dehydrated tomato and  Macedonia cheese for the extra crunch. Though the dish was interesting and presented well, the flavor and texture didn't impress me as much as the mushroom-feta burger. Though I liked the substitution of thinly sliced zucchini instead of the actual pasta, it failed to accentuate the tomato sauce flavor. I also was expecting the dish to be warm but it turned out to be cold, and I think I prefer my lasagne warm :PIf I could, I would rate this place a 3.5 for it's delicious burger and ambiance! But sadly the lasagne was a disappointment and the place felt a bit too cozy.  Would I go back there again? I would, just because I would like to give this place another try with their other selections and desserts. Pro:-Romantic setting -Creative dishes-Healthy, raw choicesCons:-Too cozy with little privacy -Expensive-Hard to see the Today's Special's Menu from seating-No wifi"

Vegan cheese. I guess if you squint and pretend that the only cheese you've ever eaten is cream cheese, then this MAY fool you in to thinking it's cheese. In all honestly it's nothing like cheese but it's bloody delicious and I'm pretty sure I ate more than half of my share of what was a shared dish. The crackers it came with were really good smeared with our ""cheese"" made from pinenuts.  This is an absolute must order if you dine here.On a later visit I sat for half an hour, stole the free wifi and drank a coconut water.

The star of the meal was definitely the homemade kimchi nori rolls. These are sushi rice rolls packed with kimchi and chickpeas and god knows what vegetables, but they are irresistable. Super yummy, and tastes healthy at the same time. The soups were good, but nothing to shout about. The nut cheese was interesting, being a cheese made without any dairy, but I thought it was a tad overpriced. The avocado sashimi rice (forbidden rice, avocado, roasted edamame, other vegetables) was very tasty with a hint of sesame oil, but the portion was quite small. The quinoa rice was very bland, don't get it. Will be back for the nori rolls for sure! Good craft beer selection as well, and comfy, relaxed environment."

I suspect someone is sleeping and didn't take the food out immediately after it's cooked. What a waste.Selected wing beans, paper wrapped chicken and kueh kosui.Winged bean too finely cut. Was much better when Chef was at Folklore. Pork rib was there but no sight of pork belly.Kueh kosui was nice and soft but a tad too sweet for my liking."

He said just lunch items. So Guiga Korean BBQ is located at the Tanjong Pagar area. To sum up, I never like the location. The place is just not vibing with me. Even the birds there looked different and strange. FOOD 4/5The banchan served was really good!! My Bangyetamg (Ginseng Chicken Soup) was really good! Was it life changing? No, but it was very good. I had the soup with the bowl of rice given. Ramyun was disappointing! The broth has a strong bell pepper flavor. Not sure why they would put bell peppers in ramyun, maybe it was something I did not know. It was one bad ramyun!SERVICE 3/5Adequate service was rendered. The staff was robotic (the bad kind), placed my brother's dish on the side of the table and another of his in front of me. Put my bangyetang in front of my brother. My brother has to move those bowls and plates around. I complained to my brother, he said it was fine. As usual, my brother was the kindest of us all.AMBIANCE 3/5When I walked in, I smelled some cigarette odor. I was told maybe it was from the bbq/hood/grill. I don't know, I did not know all the above could smell like cigarette :( It was not a big restaurant, somewhat dim. Maybe that was what a hole in the wall meant? I don't know, too dark (not the romantic kind) for me. Maybe it would be charming for other people.Glad my brother wanted to go Barisart for coffee/ tea after lunch. Again, I just followed him around, at least he was very mindful and sweet when we walked around those old shop houses with him cautioning me of those steps so I would not fall.

It is, after all a Korean BBQ place!Our order:- Yukgaejang (): A hearty, spicy beef soup that's highly popular in Korea. Made with shredded beef, lots of scallions and other vegetables such as gosari (fernbrake fiddleheads), beansprouts, and mushrooms, this is a substantial soup that has great depth of flavor. If you love this but can't take too much spiciness, you can ask them to tone down the spice factor. Absolutely love this!- BiBimBap (): The so-called ultimate comfort Korean food. My friend's order was surprisingly just nice for her; not too much rich. The sauce was simply delicious though it might be slightly hot for some so be careful with the portion.The cold noodles () on the menu looks delicious and I will definitely be back to try it soon!P.s. the waitresses have a korean look but speaks very fluent chinese."

I'm not korean but I think I have a taste for good korean food.  I found Guiga to be better than average.  I like the way they prepared their marinated galbi.  But the meat was a little fatty and wasnt a lot of it.  We got the beef platter which was supposed to be for 2-3 people but I found it barely fed 2.  They didnt serve bulgogi and I'm always amazed by korean places that dont have it on the menu.  The banchan (sides) were ok.  Not really all that impressive but better than the places that just serve kimchi.  Now I didnt order any other the other dishes since there was just 2 people. The menu actually looked pretty good.  I may go back again and try some of the other items on the menu.  Overall I'd say it was good for a KBBQ fix but didnt really wow me.

I think it is quite a good incentive for diners to eat and go instead of lingering and chatting among themselves long after the food is gone, and a big crowd is waiting outside for a table. Having read about the crowd if you go at the usual dinner time, we decided to go early and arrived around 6pm. The place was already half filled by then. At around 7pm, there was a line of people waiting for a table and it was only a Monday night. Having spied the early bird special of getting 20% off, we decided to try to leave by 730pm and let others have our table. A feat as we had two friends who only arrived close to 7pm and had just 30 minutes to finish the food. They ran out of the watermelon shell for the watermelon soju so we skipped that. Instead we tried the corn cheese which was really just average. A bit too creamy and cheesy that it was quite jelat (very rich) after a while and it was already shared by 4. The ganjang chicken wings (soy sauce) were really good and I must say I prefer the wings to the actual fried chicken pieces. The fried chicken were cut into 4 pieces and the breast meat was a bit on the dry side and not that enjoyable after a while. It would be worse if you did not order the chicken with any sauce. We had spicy up (not that spicy after all) and yangnyum up (like sweet and sour sauce with a bit of spice). The skin was crispy and delicious and the meat (except breast meat) moist and tender.I think 4 diners are just the right group size to try 2 different types of fried chicken and a side of chicken wings as you get 2 chicken pieces and a chicken wing. It may be different if you are very hungry or have a group of guys. The buffet is still available though they limit a 2 hour window for that."

The fries was tasty with beef that wasn't overly cooked. The stew was a tad too sweet and spicy for my liking. The watermelon soju was interesting but taste wise I think it's mediocre. I tried to make reservations an hour before I arrived and the staff curtly told told me to just show up because reservations are not necessary. When I arrived, the place was full.

I didn't pay attention and a little of the soup went down the wrong pipe and I was coughing and tearing for a long time. That said, it's actually not outrightly spicy if you are careful.

Rejoice! I think I have found my go-to drinking and KFC place on the island. The variety, the vibe, and the sheer portions of the chicken is indeed one up from the rest.The moment you walk into Chicken Up, you feel this warmth about the place- Kpop featured on the big screen, beer and soju all around, call buttons for service... this feels a bit like home (Ktown LA). Simulated and having the concept of ""rounds"" when partying in Korea, I believe that Chicken Up is perfect for ""Ee-Cha"" (2nd round- more drinking and noshing on snacks) before heading out for Karaoke. Something that Singaporeans should really start adapting to.Lets get on with the food, shall we?Original Fried Chicken: Amazing. The skin is fried perfectly and well seasoned, while the meat is super juicy and moist. Honestly delicious. It takes me back to the ones in Korea.I don't even know why real KFC or Popeye's exist when you can have this chicken. Seriously, one of the best.Soy Chicken Wings: Also a delicious marinade. 4 wings, large and meaty with ample soy garlic. Very delicious.Sweet & Spicy Chicken: A bit too sweet for my liking, was hoping to have a bit more kick, but equally delicious.  They also serve a ""popcorn chicken"" version of this sauce the comes boneless. **Tip for all you Americanized people- this is the closest to Orange Chicken you will get in Singapore. Screw Panda Express, Chicken Up's popcorn chicken + a bowl of rice may very well be my go-to meal at least once a week. It's THAT good.**Odeng Tang (Fishcake soup): I was feeling a bit under the weather but the spicy broth hit the spot.  The portion of fishcake was VERY generous.Cheese Corn: Gooey, Rich, Creamy- honestly perfect for beer.Truffle Fries: Ample seasoning, good portion for sharing.Beverages: Korean drinks, Hite, Soju, Draft, Asahi, Maggoli, you name it, they have it. Outstanding.Only downfall- the radish cubes were not marinated as well as I liked it to be, but this is a very minor detail.so, why come to Chicken Up? 3 reasons.1. $25 AYCE Chicken Dinner, with $15 AYCD Beer top up. Best deal in town. Perfect for guys2. Perfect place to unwind with your friends, snack, nosh, and catch up on Kpop3. Large and delicious portions and a good variety of Anju (Korean Tapas) Now all they need is a noribang next door and my Ktown experience would be complete here in Singapore."

The dude and I are not buffet people. We took the buffet because it made sense to pay $25 to try a few flavors since even though he's half Korean, we both had no idea what Yamyung (?) or Andong stew was. Not being buffet people, we were therefore also set on just enjoying a slow meal, appreciating the flavors and talking instead of trying to cram as much food as possible down our gut.Here's the problem.The fried chicken here is really, really good. I would say it ranks second or slightly on par with No. 5's har cheong gai in terms of fried chicken execution. Very crisp on the outside even after the chicken has cooled, ridiculously juicy on the inside. We had the soy sauce, spicy, curry and popcorn flavors and then a stew each. The stew is quite light and we love the kick from the chillis bouncing off the sweet sauce.Ended up eating way too fast, probably too much and we were very full. Happy too. The ""truffle"" fries (there's really sparse specks of truffle shavings in the salt) were nothing to scream about but they were well fried too. The salad was wilted.

We walked out of there feeling really sick. Really really sick and swearing off fried chicken for the next few months or year. That's because the chicken cuts are pretty big. Like KFC size pieces. So it's not the same as eating wings elsewhere. Go slow... And pace yourself. They took really long serving our chicken so we stuffed our faces with those oily bits and were so happy until that feeling kicked in. Also go for the cheese corn.

It is essentially a 1-litre mug of Heineken draught. Yep, 1-litre! Not difficult to understand why I like the place, eh? On to the food. Not your usual traditional Korean fare and not quite KFC. One of the side dishes is actually steamed Korean dumplings which are light and delightful, an excellent contrast to the fried chicken. All patrons also gets served free salad and pickles the moment you place your orders. Definitely good to partake in a little greens before the unhealthy stuff.  The chicken is served spicy or spicier, Korean chilli style! Crispier than crisp on the outside; soft, juicy and tender on the inside. Recently, South Korea's plans for world domination through the incredibly formulaic yet insanely infectious kpop has been gathering pace at an alarming rate. One fortunate by-product is Chicken Up ending up on our shores. This tiny eatery is everything Korean down to their staff, most of the regulars and the insanely annoying yet addictive kpop tunes and programmes broadcasting on their tv.

That was an interesting experience as most restaurant does not really gives attention to someone who dine alone.I would like to go back there again to try out different soju and meals. This is surely a comeback place for me.  I'm not as sober today as i'm keeping up to my word in writing a review for Chicken up ! Thanks for the card it made me remember my promise you know what i mean !"

My favourite was the soy chicken wings, but the others were pretty good too. Crispy outside, moist inside. I don't have much to carp about on the food front.Bad news: The service is awful. 2 servers on a Sunday night sounds ok for a small eatery, right? Problem is, they're forgetful. We didn't get our drinks till after the chicken arrived, and only because I asked. The 2nd round of drinks was also forgotten. 2 tables away, it emerged that they hadn't gotten their chicken because the server thought that they were having the chicken buffet option (they weren't, although I fail to see how that should affect their food service). Salad is supposed to be complimentary. We got none. When I asked (presumably the owner),  he said pretty apologetically that they were probably out. Dude. First, you're open till 2am, and it wasn't even 10pm yet. Secondly, why did we have to ASK to hear that you were out of salad? It should have been said upfront.In sum: If there's another voucher-type deal, we might go again, but otherwise, I'd be willing to pay more for less forgetful and sloppy service."

I work at Tanjong Pagar and decided to walk in for dinner with my sister. I was greeted by the staffs friendly smile and korean music(though im not a huge fan). The ambience made it welcoming. Initially, i wanted to try their various types of chicken. However, their portioning was too much for 2 person, and the staff recommended us to take their buffet which was $25 for all we can eat chicken. Additional $15 for free flow beer which we thought was worth it. Therefore, we decided on the buffet.They provide free flow salad before the food arrives, so we had something to munch on while waiting for the food. We had Spicy Up, Mild Up, Curry Up, Yangyum, Soya Chicken, Andong Stew and Popcorn Chicken.My personal favorite would be the Andong and Soya Chicken. Both of them are very mouth savoring. Very tasty and will defintely crave for them in the future.The free flow beer was a really good deal as we love drinking beer and that the beer goes well with the fried chicken.Compared to elsewhere, the chicken here isnt as oily. The flour isnt as thick and therefore perfect to me. I spent $44 per person.Must tries: Soya chicken, Andong Chicken Stew, Spicy UpI also recommend this place for:Ala Carte, Buffet, Dinner, Supper"

It wasn't fresh and was hardly crusty.The nachos were excellent, mixing cheesy goodness (proper cheese and not American cheese) and tender flavourful pulled pork. It was very big for a side. Although it was served with thousand island dip, it was flavourful enough as is was and I found that the dip just confused the flavour profile.Unfortunately, the service here was bad, even for Singapore.I went to the back of the shop to see if the water was self service, saw that it was not, and then asked the female staff member for 2 cups of iced water. She then barked at me, and I quote, ""Go away. Not self service"". I don't think any service staff in Singapore has ever been so rude to me.The cashier also had a very sian (bored/tired) manner and spoke in a monotone when I placed my order (though she brightened up a little later).Lastly, my nachos took more than 40 minutes to come, and I had to remind the staff once.As such I am docking off a star from my rating of this place due to the bad service (and probably also the lack of air conditioning, which was very noticeable at lunchtime)."

Toasts with kaya and butter tasted good. Kaya carried a sweet taste. It's a new experience for me. For the beverage, I ordered mixed tea and coffee. The taste was unique. I believed they used  condensed milk to make the beverage because the sweetness didn't seems to come from the sugar. Since the hotel gave me the voucher and it covered the bill for my order.

Even though it appeared to be a very small portion size, it was pretty filling. The kaya (coconut jam) was in a little bowl on the side, and added a nice coconut flavor to the toast.The service speed was a little slow.

We normally begin with a cider or cocktail, but they do have mocktails available as well. We often times start with the Halim Bademjan ($13), which is pureed eggplant with braised, tender lamb and green lentils, garnished with sun-dried yougurt and mint sauce. It's basically babaganoush and is a wonderful appetizer, but not Paleo if paired with their bread. They will bring you cut up veggies if you request, and it's delicious! The hummus ($10) is also a great option, but still a Paleo cheat.I've also had the Soup E Jow ($11), which features barley, herbs, vegetables and chicken. The North Dakota girl in me adores this comfort-food soup, but the Paleo angel on my shoulder disapproves! Our go to entree is the Shabestan Platter for Two ($95).

Turns out, it was just their regular lunch menu.The deal includes soup of the day, a main course (from a limited list) and dessert, along with a soft drink.For the soup of the day, we got the Ash-Reshth and Soup-E-Jow. The former is vegetarian and had these Persian noodles stewing in a soup of cilantro, spinach and herbs. It was alright. I'm not sure how Persian noodles are supposed to be cooked like but it was a tad overcooked for me. The Soup-E-Jow was sort of a Persian take on chicken soup and it tasted great.We selected the Lamb Kubideh and Zereshk Polo with Chicken. The Zereshk dish was so-so. It seemed like the chicken curry my mum would make but my friend thought otherwise. However, the saffron rice with pomegranates and pistachios that accompanied the dish was amazing. It was wonderfully flavoured. The Lamb Kubideh won me over, hands down. It was juicy and just thinking about it right now has got me salivating!! It was just fresh and a definite must try! As for dessert,  we each got a scoop of Persian saffron ice cream with chopped pistachios. Ah...it was really good. Not too sweet and cleansed the palette very well.This place is a definite must try!"

What I liked were: location, service, food, ambience. But ultimately, the price point was a bit high for the experience. We sat inside, and ordered the platter for two and the hummus app. The food is good considering there isnt much competition for Persian cuisine in Singapore. Meats were well seasoned, and the portions are generous, which I find true for most Persian restaurants. The lamb and chicken were definitely the highlights, but I would've liked to try a salad as well. I'd recommend you under order on the protein/platter (get a platter for 2 as a table of 3), so you can try another app or salad. Also, remember to ask for a small serving of garlic yogurt and chili padi sauce. They're delicious and help bring everything together. If you come for dinner, then you might also be welcomed by some lively music and belly dancing. I enjoy dinner entertainment, but if prefer privacy ask for a table inside -it's less audible. We ended up paying $189, which was the premise of the 3 stars, but I'd come back. The food is good, and I think you can fare better with a little menu hacking and a bigger group."

I always demand something spicy whether it's chili flakes, chili padi, chopped jalapeño or grilled peppers. Not only did the host/manager give me and my fiancé two big bowls of mouthwatering spicy sauce each, he also made sure I had plenty of green peppers on the side, grilled to perfection.

We normally begin with a cider or cocktail, but they do have mocktails available as well. We often times start with the Halim Bademjan ($13), which is pureed eggplant with braised, tender lamb and green lentils, garnished with sun-dried yougurt and mint sauce. It's basically babaganoush and is a wonderful appetizer, but not Paleo if paired with their bread. They will bring you cut up veggies if you request, and it's delicious! The hummus ($10) is also a great option, but still a Paleo cheat.I've also had the Soup E Jow ($11), which features barley, herbs, vegetables and chicken. The North Dakota girl in me adores this comfort-food soup, but the Paleo angel on my shoulder disapproves! Our go to entree is the Shabestan Platter for Two ($95). It comes with minced lamb, chicken, fish, prawn, and a lamb or beef fillet. We always opt for the beef.In addition to the food, they have a belly dancer on Friday evenings, beginning around 8:00 pm. It's never too hard to get a table here, and we've had luck every time even when we haven't made reservations."

Turns out, it was just their regular lunch menu.The deal includes soup of the day, a main course (from a limited list) and dessert, along with a soft drink.For the soup of the day, we got the Ash-Reshth and Soup-E-Jow. The former is vegetarian and had these Persian noodles stewing in a soup of cilantro, spinach and herbs. It was alright. I'm not sure how Persian noodles are supposed to be cooked like but it was a tad overcooked for me. The Soup-E-Jow was sort of a Persian take on chicken soup and it tasted great.We selected the Lamb Kubideh and Zereshk Polo with Chicken. The Zereshk dish was so-so. It seemed like the chicken curry my mum would make but my friend thought otherwise. However, the saffron rice with pomegranates and pistachios that accompanied the dish was amazing. It was wonderfully flavoured. The Lamb Kubideh won me over, hands down. It was juicy and just thinking about it right now has got me salivating!! It was just fresh and a definite must try! As for dessert,  we each got a scoop of Persian saffron ice cream with chopped pistachios. Ah...it was really good. Not too sweet and cleansed the palette very well.This place is a definite must try!"

What I liked were: location, service, food, ambience. But ultimately, the price point was a bit high for the experience. We sat inside, and ordered the platter for two and the hummus app. The food is good considering there isnt much competition for Persian cuisine in Singapore. Meats were well seasoned, and the portions are generous, which I find true for most Persian restaurants. The lamb and chicken were definitely the highlights, but I would've liked to try a salad as well. I'd recommend you under order on the protein/platter (get a platter for 2 as a table of 3), so you can try another app or salad. Also, remember to ask for a small serving of garlic yogurt and chili padi sauce. They're delicious and help bring everything together. If you come for dinner, then you might also be welcomed by some lively music and belly dancing. I enjoy dinner entertainment, but if prefer privacy ask for a table inside -it's less audible. We ended up paying $189, which was the premise of the 3 stars, but I'd come back. The food is good, and I think you can fare better with a little menu hacking and a bigger group."

I always demand something spicy whether it's chili flakes, chili padi, chopped jalapeño or grilled peppers. Not only did the host/manager give me and my fiancé two big bowls of mouthwatering spicy sauce each, he also made sure I had plenty of green peppers on the side, grilled to perfection.

You can make your own including a base, protein (salmon, tuna, chicken breast, sirloin) and toppings galore.

The dining area were half filled with customers and hence we were able to choose to sit on a high chair or normal seating arrangements. Personally, I have not had poke bowls ever since I stepped out of California. Hence this make-your-own bowl concept was intriguing especially with the vast varieties of items that you could add onto your bowl. For the base, I ordered Signature Sushi Rice. For the flavor, I ordered Spicy Mayo Salmon and Spicy Garlic Sesame Tuna (additional cost). For the toppings, Pineapple, Edamame, Nori Flakes, Lime Avocado and Spiced Roasted cashews (some of them are with additional costs).Decided to sit on one of the high tables. On the side, there was a serving table with ""dressings"" that you could add onto the poke bowl. The colors of my bowl looked vibrant and it definitely made me to dig in straightaway.The combination was perfect. I love each and every ingredients I chose. Each of them have distinct tastes which combined the dish well - crunchy, sweet, sour, spicy.. The must tries are the roasted cashews, tuna and salmon. This place's interior design made the surroundings to be homey. Service was fast but a little pricey. But overall, I enjoyed my meal and will be back again in the near future."

It tastes a little better than it does in the US. The food has a really good quality that you can only see in Singapore. I know poke is still new in Singapore and I have to say they did a really good job of making my order. After you pick your base you can get the same ingredients that you see in an American poke joint. If you are a hardcore addict of poke you can add the premium ingredients for an extra cost. Here they have drinks and won't overcharge you no matter what you get. I love the smoothie they have. Tastes real authentic and is perfect for lunch.It's a place where many millennial can have a work or school break. The staff here is real happy and really care for the customer. Getting a to go is good as well because you can pair it with some Milo. The price is good if you are an US tourist. Come here whether you are a poke fan or not

And maybe one or two items of flair. I think the ""poke wars"" of 2016 have made diversifying a priority for competitive differentiation between poke shops. Too bad poke is a commodity and should stay that way. Complexity dilutes taste. But if you don't care about taste and would rather queue up to spend money on a glorified bouquet. Go ahead.

Let's start with quick tips for first timers:1. Cats are not dogs. If you keep dangling the toy and they're not taking the bait, it's not going to happen. Also, some cats are just not into petting so if you're trying to touch it and it's shying away, please stop2. Let the cat come to you. Sit down near it, on the floor. Let them smell your hands before touching them. Respecting the cat will allow you to earn their trust the quickest.3. MOST IMPORTANT TIP: Try to ask the employees if you can see the cats and the room before signing up for an hour. You should see if the cats are in a napping mood, or if the other patrons are interacting in a way that you can enjoy. I actually ended up leaving 10 minutes early because a pushy group of 10 people came in and started being loud and bothering the cats. Before, it was myself, and a local couple and a German couple, and we were totally fine. Check the situation before you commit! This is the single most important piece of advice I can give you for enjoying your cat cafe experience.Alright, as for the experience itself:PRICING: I don't think S$14 is expensive for an hour and a drink (the complimentary drink can be mineral water or coke). Think about how much it costs to raise a cat and realize some of your money goes to support causes to take care of catsDRINKS: I got the special, a Thai Iced Tea. It was an additional $2.50 on top, but I think it was fairly priced. Was it worth it? Not really, nothing special here. The latte art for the coffee based drinks seemed decent. And for some other hot drinks, they give you a nice ceramic cover to keep your drink warm and the cat hair out.CATS: Definitely a range of characters here. Elliot was my favorite, a long-haired softie. There are a few cats that seem like not really people cats, cats that would naturally avoid everyone. It would be great if people could not think of cat cafes as petting zoos, but as cafes that happen to have cats. So enjoy doing something else while appreciating cats while you can. Overall, there were about 7 cats when I visited but at least 3 were sleeping basically the entire time. AGAIN, CHECK THE ROOM BEFORE YOU COMMIT- if it's nap time, come back later.INTERACTION: They do appreciate cat treats, and the staff will occasionally give people cat treats to give to cats. I think it's a good thing that you can't buy unlimited cat treats because people would ultimately overfeed the cats to get their attention. This isn't good for making $$$, but it's definitely better for the cats. Well done, management.ROOM: Nicely decorated and ventilated, not too cold. You can hear noise from the street but it's not bad. There's a number of seats, I bet the room could seat 10 max. However, due to the distribution of cats, people will naturally concentrate in certain areas. There are plenty of cat structures. Overall, I'm giving 3 stars. To be honest, it's not the fault of the management per se as to why I felt that this was a 3 star experience. Here's why: First of all, half the cats were asleep when I came (Saturday afternoon), but I know cats sleep for over 14 hours a day, I have cats. I should have checked the room before I committed.Second, of the cats that were awake, there were a few that just weren't really into interaction. I think it's food that the cats are sourced from bad situations, but perhaps they could select more of the cats that are proven to be forwardly-friendly. I've met cats like this before, I know they exist. Third and most importantly, the group that came in during my last 20 minutes. A group of 10 Chinese kids (probably college age) that were fairly loud, shoving around to take photos of the cats. I was sitting there just chilling with this cat and one of these guys started taking pictures of me with the cat and I just felt really awkward. Again, for my first half hour, I was here with a German couple and a Singaporean couple and we were all polite and respecting each others' space and it was great. This really soured the experience for me and this is why I left a bit early.OVERALL - an A-OK experience. I might swing by singapore again and visit the other cat cafe nearby Bugis and give some comparison feedback."

To my dismay, Saigon Cafe is owned and run by the same person who owns Viet Inn by Raffles Place/Boat Quay! Even the menu is identical. The set menu special offer is identical too! They also own Saigon Lotus at Marina Square.Despite that initial bit of news, we ordered dinner.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?The char siew here was very good, although I'm continually surprised that there's so much bone and other inedibles in the mix. On that same note, the duck had so many little inedible bits and pieces in it that it was entirely impossible to eat, which was disappointing.

Oh, and rice too if you prefer that.The star is undoubtedly the char siew, closely followed by the siu yok. The char siew is a delicious combination of fat, lean meat and charred exterior that really hits the spot. You will probably end up with a couple of slices of char siew that are all fat and you can ignore them because really, a little fat goes a long way. If you're really squeamish about the amount of fat on your meat, you can request for leaner portions.Place your order at the stall with whomever's holding a notepad (usually a lady) and choose between the warm and humid coffee shop interior or the hot and warm-airy outside. Either way, you're going to have to wait if the tables are filled because the food takes a while to get to your table. Going in the evening makes for a more comfortable dining experience but don't dawdle because they close at 8pm.Get your green chilli and chilli sauce yourself from the side of the stall. The chilli sauce is provides a nice acidic and spicy kick and goes perfect with the meats. Drinks and ice are also self-service from the fridges and are at a standard price of $1 per can."

It essentially is a roasted meat shop that conveniently sells drinks too. Well, a roasted meat shop that just happens to sell my favourite wanton mee in singapore. It definitely helps that the roasted char siew is done the way it should be, the way that many char siew shops around the country just can't seem to get right. I've never been a fan of char siew that is painted in artificial red; for me that is the surest warning sign that I'm not in for a good one. The colour of this roast pork is a sweet, deep, caramel brown, quietly revealing the time, effort and skill that resulted in this creation. Oh, and they are not stingy in their portion of this beautiful meat -at all-.And then the noodles are absolutely perfect. The noodles are silky yet softly solid, and as you slurp them be careful of not splashing the wonderfully savoury and sweet sauce all around you, and I have clumsily managed to do on so many occasions, probably because of how slippery and smooth the texture of the noodles are. The wantons are good too - a little mixture of texture in it, with the smooth soft skin on the outside and some crunchy bits within the minced meat within. The soup's pretty good too. I think you get the point - it's all really good, but I'm not making it sound as good as it is probably because of how GREAT the noodles and the char siew are.If that doesn't draw you in, maybe the little price of $4 for the whole shebang will tempt you"

The restaurant itself is pretty huge for SG standards and able to accommodate multiple huge parties. When you sit down, you're given a menu to order your dim sum items. There aren't any food carts they push around. However, the service was slow, so you should expect to wait and extended period of time to receive your food. (Average 30 mins, minus a star there).

I ordered the following:- Steamed BBQ pork  (Recommend)- Crystal Chieves  dumpling - Fried Sweet Potatoes w/scallop    (Recommend)- Xiao Long Bao- Rice Porridge w/Century egg- Lotus leaf Rice    Keep in mind the portions are smaller than your typical Dim sum restaurant.  So if you're starving, you should order one extra one.

Yum Cha also sells seafood dishes like signature salted egg prawns and even chilli crabs. They've been at this location for the past 16 years, and they also provide delivery services.For the upcoming Mother's Day in May, Yum Cha has created a new concept that will be avaialble from 1st-14th May at Yum Cha Chinatown and Yum Cha Changi outlets. Their goal is to re-create the long-lost taste of traditional Chinese dishes that mother and grandmothers would remember with nostalgia of their hometowns.1. Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetable Bun $2/BunA nostalgic classic dish, this delicious bun, which was eaten for days while our ancestors were fleeing the war in China before settling down in different parts of Asia. The quality tender pork belly is braised in Yum Cha's secret recipe sauce for hours to create a sweet and succulent taste that is balanced by a soft and fluffy steamed bun.This is quite a different kind of bun as it is pillowy and has a slight fragance to it. The meat was indeed juicy, tasty and I can imagine getting about 3 of these in a go. Definitely don't miss this!2. Fish Maw with Shrimp PasteThis was an interesting dish that I had never tried before. The shrimp paste itself was a huge generous serving and it was extremely tasty going with the sauce on the dish. The fish maw was soft and jelly like, adding a light texture to the meaty shrimp paste.3. Pan Fried Salted Fish Bun $5 for 3 piecesYet another traditional chinese dish originating from the Guangdong provnice, this salted fish bun used to be a favourite of the Emperor Kang Xi  of the Qing Dynasty. The bottom bun is seared to a golden brown, with a flavourful filling made from salted fish paste and minced meat. To enhance its flavour, Yum Cha has added a secret seasoning for a more savoury experience. This was one of my favourites of the night. The bun was soft and pillow but yet had a slight crisp on the edges. The salted fish wasn't too salty and was perfect for my taste buds. 4. Pumpkin, Yam, and Golden Cake $4.80 for 3 pieces *highly recommended*A very pretty dish was served with this flower. The exterior of the golden cake was definitely beyong my expectations. It was extremely crispy, biscuit-like and biting into it, you will taste the moist yam and the sweet pumpkin in the center. A pretty ingenious sweet dish in my opinion. Definitely don't miss this. It's not that sweet, it was more of a savoury dish.5. Signature Salted Egg PrawnsI was waiting all night to try this. This was a huge serving of fresh and crunchy prawns. In the center, was a salad that had the salted egg sauce. This was a very different presentation than what we normally see, whereby the prawns are deshellled and cooked in salted egg sauce. 6. Black Pepper Lotus Beef (Large, $48)I loved the presentation of this dish, delicate and beautifully plated. The lotus were thinly sliced and were crisp like a potato chip. The vegetables added some colour to the black pepper beef. The Black pepper beef wasn't spicy at all, which is great for non-spicy eaters such as myself. The beef itself was extremely tender, soft and juicy.  The beef itself is imported from Brazil!7. Crab Meat Xiao Long BaoMy personal favourite dim sum is xiao long bao and Yum Cha's rendition of this delicacy is pimped up with crab meat. Picking it up with chopsticks usually requires some skill so as to not burst the delicate xiao long bao skin. But I could pick it up with ease and even hold it up for a period of photo taking. The skin itself isn't paper thin, but when biting into the xiao long bao, you can enjoy the soft texture of the skin and behind it, you find a very savoury soup and chunk of meat embedded in the xiao long bao. 8. 7 Flavour TofuThis was a very interesting tofu. Everyone at the table tasted different flavours. The tofu itself was soft, almost like a steamed egg. With a light crisp tofu skin with sweet, salty and even spicy flavours from the seasoning on top of the tofu.9. Fried Vermicelli SeafoodThe vermicelli had tons of wok-hei which made this a favourite at the table. Yum Cha was extremely generous with the ingredients that it only took us moments to devour this entire plate of goodness. The noodles were stir fried in prawns, scallops, vegetables and fish slices.10. Almond Tart $3.20/3 pieces *highly recommended*Yum Cha's classic almond tart has a soft and flaky texture. In the center, you will find a smooth almond custard that is not too sweet and just right for it's size. It can served chilled and its sweet taste will be a hit with children!I'm a pastry buff and I know it when I eat excellent pastry. The pastry shell has the perfect level of crisp to it and every bite was perfect. My only regret was that I did not get any of these Almond Tarts to-go to share with my family. The almond fillings absolutely melt in your"

Made with their secret recipe, this homemade sauce gave a sourish sweet aftertaste. Paired together with their fish sauce, both made the whole plate of Yu sheng very tasty and appetizing. If you're a very 年年有""鱼"" person, you could add on more fish portions at only $12. HUAT ah!!Rating 5/5(2) Fried Crispy Chicken[$40+ whole]- Chicken was fried till golden brown color with slight crisp on the skin. I'm rather surprised that the meat texture was dry and tough even on the thigh part so I guessed the deep frying method dried out the meat. Marinades wasn't strong and flesh tastes rather bland, the only flavorful part was at the skin where the crispy garlic bits were scattered on top. You may want to dip the chicken in Yum cha's homemade sweet chillies sour plum sauce to bring more flavour to the meat. Rating 3/5(3) BBQ Suckling Pig[$220+ whole / $118+ half]- Crackling skin of this suckling pig made me gave up on my diet plans and went for more portions. Meat was flavourful with fats evenly distributed throughout the whole pig. It wasn't oily at all. Dip with a little of the smokey sweet sauce provided and it was heavenly! Although ""peng cai"" was more commonly seen on the tables during CNY than a ""suckling pig"" but for a change, I suggest you order this suckling pig instead. Skin so crispy its definitely worth all the calories. Rating 5/5(4) Braised Pig's Trotter with ""Fatt Choy"" [$38+ half leg]- Pork trotter was slow-braised till really soft and tender. Meat falls off from bone easily without me using any strength. Chinese spices was not strong and I suggest flavour can be heavier. Fatt choy (black moss) used did not help in the taste, only being a traditional auspicious ingredient as people always said ""fatt choy"" sounds like ""发财"" in mandarin. Dried oysters would be a better option to improve the overall taste of this dish.  My most love and also the best parts of this trotter were the jelly skin and tendons. They were so Q, packed with collagen and ""melt-in-the-mouth""!Rating 4/5(5) Fried Rice with Chinese Sausages in Lotus leaf [$38+ whole]- I'm quite disappointed with the inconsistency of this dish. Other than texture being dry, parts of the rice were undercooked. The other main, important ingredient ""chinese sausages"" were not much visible too because they were cut into micro cubes instead of slices which I felt the size was unnecessary. I totally could not taste their existence thus lack the aroma of preserved meat. Dried shrimps used were also very tiny although chef was generous to throw in a lot. Rating 1/5. Skip this."

The sauces were pretty heavy and overwhelmed the taste of the pasta for the most part - something I'm not used to. Still, thanks for the service with a smile even when my partner and I were the last to leave on a late weekday night :)"

The interiors are dimly (but aesthetically) lit, so you don't feel like you've come to such a busy place. The owner is good to talk to, they'd be happy to suggest you dishes in a no-nonsense way. Don't expect to be pampered here, really. The food is amazing. We had ravioli and risotto, both amazing. The third dish (ordered on the owner's recommendation) was something the likes of which I'd never had. It was basically two massive sausages on lentil (dry version of the indian Dal). Very interesting. Indeed. LIn short, the place offers you a great evening, is centrally located, and is much bigger on the inside than what the facade suggests. Not to forget, it's not overly costly."

Read from other reviews that the service is poor so we braced ourselves. When we arrived, we were seated and the restaurant was only running on 20% capacity for lunch. During ordering, staff was helpful to give advice on the food items. I was pleasantly surprised with one of the service staff who over to fasten a back cushion for me. That's awfully sweet of him to go to that extra mile for me. Grilled Eggplant - tender slices of eggplant grilled till soft and then served with melted cheese and tomato sauce over them. Perfect starters!Calamari - I think this dish fell short somewhat. The batter was soft by the time we ate them and though the serving size was quite generous, I found the calamari rather bland. If not for the tomato dip that accompanies the rings, it would totally tank. I won't order this again. Ravioli Con Carne - this is our best pasta dish of the meal! Little pillows of soft beef dressed in a strong tasting cheese sauce, something like blue cheese but not. Just really yummy lah!Before our Squid Ink pasta arrived, we were both offered bibs that they nicely secured on for us. I supposed if the black sauce splatter on you, it'll be quite a nightmare to remove. So thoughtful!!Squid Ink Seafood Pasta - quite a big plate of pasta that is a whole plate of Nero (that's Italian for black) goodness. Seafood is fresh and generous in amount. The squid ink sauce is very flavourful and every mouth of al dente pasta a party in the mouth!Spinach Ravioli - very good ravioli with tomato sauce. Not that this is not nice, it IS but this dish does pale in comparison to the other 2 pasta dishes. You can opt to have a half half of the Ravioli pastas on the same plate. This is what we did so we got to taste more without being too full!!Tiramisu - a nice generous square of cake. You can really taste the rum in it (nice!) and with the mascarpone cheese cream, a wonderful slab of heaven to finish up the meal. I dunno why so many complained about the poor service because we have enjoyed very good service, not just from one service staff but all round really. Will definitely be back to savour the rest of the menu!"

But unlike Pastamania, which is so intentionally terrible that just thinking about it risks sending me into a fit of rage, this was actually pretty good.The ribollita was just not following that recipe, it was much closer to a minestrone. The seafood stew was almost as good as the Cioppino at Cicheti, The eggplant starter was a highlight, although I am not sure if they use Italian mozzarella. The minced beef ravioli was good like everyone says. The chocolate lava cake was worth it."

It is located within walking distance from Tanjong Pagar Mrt so location wise was a good choice.Just a warning before you start ordering your meal, the pastas here are quite hearty and filling so maybe side orders would not be an added option. As silly as it sounds, i have never tried any risotto dish in Singapore before so i was keen to try it here. I ordered the Risotto Al Funghi Porcini, which is Arborio Rice cooked with Porcini Mushrooms, White Wine & Parmesan Cheese simply scrumptious. That changed my opinion of risottos as i thought it was a meal with bland rice and it was supposed to be dry.Overall i think i may visit this restaurant again for the variety of pastas that they offer."

I have a bad habit of ordering the same thing off the menu over and again - but only because it was really good the last time. I usually start off with prosciutto accompanied by slices of rock melon - not exactly the most challenging culinary feat but they always manage to get really sweet melons that pair nicely with the sharp salty taste of the meat slices. For mains, I am hooked on their squid ink pasta. Probably not the best choice if you are on a first date and hoping to impress. The last thing you need is to look like a giant squid self-imploded in your mouth. If that isn't an issue with you, tuck right in. The sauce is never over-powering and the squid slices are never rubbery - a fine balance that few achieve. The interior of the restaurant is warm and cosy with its dark wood paneling.

There were other choices such as Ninja Rice and Garden Greens. The orzo ( a form of short-cut pasta, shaped like a large grain of rice) was topped with a savoury gravy and quite tasty on its own. The onsen egg added a rich creamy layer to the orzo. The asparagus was soft and crunchy. The pickled cucumbers was tangy and crunchy, while the tuna was smooth and fresh.Fancy French (ala carte $16)Fig jam french toast drizzled in ume-boshi infused honey, fresh grapes, plums, homemade hazelnut butter.This dish had a 20 minute wait. It looked quite pretty. The fruits was fresh and juicy, the toast sliced easily although I wished that it could be crispier.Accompanied with Coconut Lemon Mint ($8)Fresh coconut juice, lemond wedges, mint leavesIt was basically fresh coconut juice, filling with thick coconut flesh.

Tuck into hearty, value-for-money meals at the newest concept to hit the hip dining enclave of Duxton Road - Ninja Bowl. You lucky CBD folks now get carb-free/low-carb Japanese-inspired superfood meals, as well as delicious all day brunch items. Each of the 8 bowl starts out carb-free but you have the options of healthy fillers. I'd go for the super high protein White Quinoa ($3); Ninja Rice (blend of blend of vinegared Japanese pearl rice and brown rice with furikake); Garden greens for $2. Fans of Japanese chashu will love the Buta ($14). I thought their slices of homemade cured aburi pork belly were better than many ramen places in Singapore. That velvety blend of meat and fats with a smoky char, sweet balsamic tomatoes, sour-sweet ume-pickled apples, roasted pumpkin seasoned with seaweed flakes and sesame seeds, were gelled nicely with  a runny onsen egg. So much love for this one!The Kabuki ($14) will make you love chicken again for the tender pieces of deboned chicken thigh are marinated in miso, soy sauce, garlic and honey. Sous-vide and then seared, expect juicy morsels accompanied by baby corn, homemade pickled beets, an onsen egg, snow peas, and a final sprinkling of fried shallots. The salmon poke ($16) pales in comparison after all that bursts of flavors in the other bowls. I couldn't quite taste the soy and ponzu sauce that the salmon chunks are supposedly marinated in. Each bowl comes with greens and a sprinkling of quinoa already, but I'd certainly recommend a carb base to help fill you up. Fish lovers could also tuck into bowls with pan-seared tuna tataki, or a saucey slice of unagi.While the bowls may be what give Ninja Bowl its name, what may bowl diners over is their All Day Brunch offerings. You will see the same ingredients being used, but now paired with creamy scrambled eggs and fragrant sourdough slices. I had the best rendition of braised beef cheek with eggs for only $17! Certainly I would never have this dish again at Common Man. You could also have the 24h braised beef in a bowl too. More Japanese inspired plates with unagi on toast ($19), and that umami miso cream Hokkaido scallops and mussels ($18). Make sure you soak up all that goodness with the bread. The latter works perfectly as a dinner starter. Love!Definitely have the Fancy French ($16), a homemade fig jam filled buttery brioche. Oh that light woody cinnamon scent, salty-sour umeboshi (pickled plum) infused honey, and the homemade hazelnut butter, created a great mix of flavors that will send anyone to breakfast heaven. It's so good that I finished half of it despite having this at the end of our meal! This pretty plate has a wait time of 20mins so order immediately. Sides, cakes, and caffeine (Smitten coffee) are available at Ninja Bowl too if you need something small (or more). There is also a weekday Tea Time Set ($10.90) available from 3pm onwards. Coffee, tea or me?Love love love Ninja Bowl! Definitely a go to for all my dietary needs. :))"

Sadly, both the food and the experience was lacking.We had the Noka (braised beef cheek), Buta (char shu) and the Yasai (salmon poke). Each bowl was about $16-18 (the price indicated on the menu does not include the base, you'll have to pay more for rice, salad, etc).First, the experience. The place doesn't take credit card, which is quite unacceptable given its location and the price of its offerings. Second, I wanted to change my order about 30 seconds after I paid (Wanted rice instead of orzo), and the cashier informed me that they could not do refunds. Seriously?Never mind, perhaps the food will live up to its expectations.The food came pretty quickly. However, the braised beef cheek had a weird aftertaste. The char shu was nothing special. The poke was ok, but the amount of poke given was tiny compared to other places with poke bowls around the Tanjong Pagar/Telok Ayer area (which also happen to charge less).The food would have been acceptable, but it was way too expensive for what it was. Coupled with bad customer experience, this place is just not worth the visit - especially with so many other good food options around the area (whether you want healthy food, salads, poke bowls, or rice bowls). Food is worth 2.5 stars, but the price and service brings it down to 1 star for me.Pros:- Free water is available- There's air-con in the placeCons:- Too expensive for the portion- Taste is so-so- Bad service experience- Much better alternatives around the area"

Make sure to ask for medium rare! They give an egg on the side for you to scramble and pour over the beef don. Definitely hit the spot with deliciousness.Comes with some side dishes: tofu, pickled veggies and beets.They have house made drinks like Sakura Cola and Wasabi Ginger Ale.Minus one star only for the numerous annoying little flies flying around.

Of course, you'll notice some familiar decor (Joey's white dog art, Ross' Unagi moment captured on photo) around too. They play FRIENDS re-runs constantly on the big screen and everytime the intro song plays, the staff will stop to clap to the beat. Right off the bat, you'll notice that the menu is full of catchphrases and puns from the long running TV show, like Janice's Oh My God baby ribs, Chandler's Thanksgiving Dinner, etc. It's cute and funny, but not worth the multiple dollar signs.

The decorations really looked like it was from FRIENDS (obviously) but the food was...good. The food tasted good, it had flavour and the cheese on the pizza was very melt-y (I don't know if that's a word or not) but... it DiDnT WoW mE. They also show episodes from the show. There are some things that the cafe can improve on. The cafe should play music from the 90s than music now so there can be more of a retro vibe. They should also change the price of their foods and drinks. Some of the drinks are overpriced for what they actually are. The drink that I got (the Monica Getty...I think) was probably 14 DoLLaRs, which is kinda a lot for a medium/regular sized drink..."

If they would just improve the food, the place would be full. I don't understand why they are wasting the opportunity. The pizza had too much unmelted cheese. The macaroni and cheese had no taste."

We order a mint tea, ($6) a cappuccino ($8) and a dessert ($16). Our dessert was suppose to have a helium balloon attached to it - but they struggled to get the balloon big enough. They called us to the counter to watch... but it didn't quite work, many times. After awhile I asked if we could sit and finish our tea / coffee because they were getting cold. The ice cream melted while they tried to inflate the balloon, so they brought us another scoop. In the end, I told them to stop trying because it had been about 15 minutes and we wanted to get to the airport. They still charged us full price which I was surprised about."

The set-up is pretty amazing - spot-on, lots of cool items from the actual show, you can even watch the show while you eat. Worst tasting food I have ever purchased in my life, hands down. The mac & cheese tasted like throw up. Not only is the food terrible but so is the service, and prices are expensive. But, you do not pay to come in to the famous Central Perk Cafe, so it sort of balances out. 2 stars instead of 1 for the awesome & internationally famous aesthetic. But if you are not a fan of the show - never come here."

They screen episodes of friends on a projector so it's hard to not enjoy your time here!"
