Opened by two youthful and energetic Joy and Jillain. You will always see them at the shop happily greeting customers and introducing their newest and innovating drinks and waffles.The concept of Nit & Grit is simple. Providing cafe worthy buttermilk waffles at affordable prices. Nit & Grit may be a takeaway eatery but there's a bench on the side for you to sit down and enjoy your food and drinks and have an entertaining chat with the two ladies.At one glance, you would notice that there's both sweet and savoury waffle options. A waffle for every palate I might add. The waffle that really screams out to me is their hotdog waffle, because unlike the picture. The hotdog is actually embedded into the waffle batter!!! 1. Buttermilk Hotdog Scrambled Eggs with Maple Syrup $3.50Check this out! The sausages are basically cooked in the waffle iron, which gives the sausages a buttermilk aroma. Atop the sausage embedded waffle is scrambled eggs which Jillian cooks on a non-stick pan. The scrambled eggs are no ordinary scrambled eggs. They are extremely smooth almost milky in texture. It definitely melts in your mouth. I was surprised at how good the eggs were.2. Buttermilk Nutella Banana $2.50The next waffle were tried was a sweet waffle, in contrast to the savoury waffle we had. This sweet waffle was a mix of nutella (my personal favourite) along with it's best friend, banana. The buttermilk waffle tends to become crispier as time goes on, as the owner Joy explained to us. True enough, after an extensive period of photo taking, the waffle had a distinctive crunchy bite in enough mouthful!The nutella was intense and would certainly satisfy any hazelnut chocoholic out there. The sweetness of the banana was just right, and wasn't too weak or too over powering for the nutella. I could certainly see myself grabbing one of these on the way home on a daily basis!3. 3 Special Earl Grey $3.50Before I even reached Nit & Grit, I did a little research on their instagram and noticed that they mentioned that that make their own pudding on a daily basis. I was curious to try their pudding and being an earl grey fan myself. This drink was a must order! The earl grey flavour was just right and the sweetness of the milk tea was perfect for me. I'm a gong cha/koi (25%-30%) sugar level person. The pudding had a subtle sweetness on it's own, along with the chin chow jelly and the pearls. The tapioca pearls had the right consistency in chewy texture.Also, their drinks here at Nit & Grit don't contain a lot of ice! The milk tea is pulled straight out of the fridge and poured into the cups. So for people like me who hate, having to dig up pearl bits hidden beneath humongous ice cubes. CELEBRATE!During my visit to Nit&Grit. I witnessed some other customers ordering this same drink which makes me confirm the right decision to order this ""best seller""4. Milo Rocher $4.90At the entrance of Nit & Grit, there's an ice cream display, with a few ice cream flavours. The ones that caught my eyes were chendol and hazelnut! Jillian and Joy suggested that we try one of their milkshakes. These innovative young ladies came with a Milo Dinosaur with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.The result of this drink? Pure chocolately goodness. The milo dinosaur was on-point with the right amount of excessive milo powder. The hazelnut rocher ice cream had a few bitey bits embedded in the ice cream, to give the drink some texture to drink up and chew. On a warm, humid day, I would believe this drink would succeed in being a ""life saver"" to many. The ice cream itself was smooth, milky, creamy and the best part, the hazelnut rocher flavour was clearly defined in every sip of the drink. There were a bit of big ice bits that I kept sipping up the straw, on my first bite, I was expecting a chocolatey bit, but nope. Other than that, this drink was good!Overall : An affordable place to grab some hearty snacks to satisfy your sweet or savoury tooth along with refreshing drinks! Oh yeah, don't leave without trying their lychee pearls. There's absolutely surprisingly good!"

The first we noticed was their extremely short hair. This was the result as they participated at the Hair For Hope. In our mind was what a sacrificed they made from this big act. Hence, we are certain that they are very kind at heart. Throughout our conversation, indeed, it manifested naturally from them.From the owner to the facade and then to the food, the same theme presented throughout Nit And Grit, that is humble. Despite the unassuming presentation and nothing worthy for the square, if you looked beyond the aesthetics, you find treasures in Nit and Grit. And you would agree that it is a hidden gem that is akin to the raw diamond that is waiting to be unearthed.Before we introduce you to their delicious waffle, we take a look at the drinks offered by Nit And Grit. Over here, they offer a very comprehensive drinks list; ranging from all sort of Tea to Chocolate, Milo, Cookies & Cream and Coffee.We tried the 3 Special Earl Grey ($3.50) and Milo Rocher ($4.90). The former is a drink consisting of a home-made pudding which the duo made daily from scratch. We love such dedication to the craft shown by their willingness to offer home-made items. In it, beside the pudding, there are grass jelly and pearls. The latter, Milo Rocher has a vanilla ice cream topped in a Milo and Rocher blend. Hence, you will find nut bites in the drink. In general, the drinks are lightly flavoured cum lightly sweetened.Moving on to the exciting item at Nit And Grit, it is their waffles. We are now big fan of their crispy waffle. Buttermilk Hotdog Scrambled Eggs with Maple Syrup Waffle ($3.50) was the savoury waffle we tried. It may look unassuming to many but we assure you that the wallet friendly pricing waffle is extremely delish. Firstly, outer crisp with buttermilk fragrance savoured. Moreover, the maple syrup augmented the taste experience. With the hotdog on the waffle, these added a savoury hint. In addition, the must mention scramble egg was soft and fluffy. We completely didn't expect such high standard coming from this modest takeaway outlet.For the sweet tooth who loves both nutella and banana will turn to the Buttermilk Nutella Banana Waffle ($2.50). The other highly recommend waffle by Joy is the Avocado Waffle. Alternatively, one could also opt for the classic Buttermilk Waffle with Ice Cream.Lastly, one could also enjoy the scoop of ice cream in a delightful cone. We had the Chendol Ice Cream ($2.50) which is the premium flavour.Most of all, we love the sincere and humble approach of Nit And Grit. At our short duration at Nit And Grit, we witness how the pair serves their customers with a heart as they remember all the regular orders of their customer. We were in awe and we like this. And we could attest to the taste of Nit And Grit crispy waffles. Nothing short of thumb ups. If you love crispy waffle, this is the must go to place for your waffle fix!"

It was opened by the editor couple of the now-defunct The Real Singapore website owners. The stall was self service style. My order was taken by a Japanese lady. Although there was no queue, I waited awhile to be served. Black Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.50)Tonkotsu noodle soup topped with charred garlic oil, served with black fungus and bamboo shoots. The soup base was not as rich and oily as the usual ramen outlets in Singapore, which also means not as salty too. Great for those who wanted healthy version, but not for those who wanted the real stuff. The noodle used here kind of reminding one of a certain brand instant noodle with rather thin texture.Gyoza ($3)Japanese style chicken and vegetable dumplingsIt was available in steamed and fried version. I had the steamed version which was quite good. The skin simply melt in the mouth with moist juicy filling.Overall the food was not bad although would prefer the soup base of the ramen to be richer in taste."

The portions were huge though, and the time it took for them to serve your order was rather quick (4 minutes), service was good too - and they were able to accommodate for my lack of skill in using chopsticks by giving me a fork.  Overall, a good place to get your daily fix of ramen - just prepare to wait though, since queues might be rather long during peak hours."

Although they've increased their floor size, the wait can get quite long still during hours. Food was pretty good; they were (overly) generous with the rice. I'm not a big rice eater, so I felt like I wasted a lot of rice (they make a mountain of rice, then toss the chopped sashimi on top to give it that propped up mountain of sashimi feel)I feel as a brand, they still have some thinking to do; I'm not sure if they're trying to appeal to the masses  like what they did with sushiro (the thing that made them incredibly successful), or be a cafe (general look of the place), or go down the ""atas"" route (they have an omakase menu)"

Maybe it was the examination period for the children, but there was no queue when we got there at 1130am. A few tables outside were available. We sat outside as it was a cool day. And despite the thunder and lightning, there was no rain. When we were there, Mediacorp was filming at the pond nearby. That kept the children entertained, as they went there to watch the filming, as well as to run around the park. The only bad thing about being seated near the washroom area was the kitchen vent nearby. You could smell the oiliness oozing out from the vent as well as the heat from it. Otherwise it was all good. Service was excellent. The staff did not chase us out even after we finished our food, and were very friendly. They told us not to mind them as they went about cleaning the place after the kitchen was closed and we were still welcome to stay at our table. Water glasses were refilled ever so often, or you could always help yourself to the water or send the kids to fill the glasses. Hehe. As a casual and family friendly dining establishment, it is great that they do not frown on the children popping in and out. Parents could watch the children running and playing in the park while they are eating. Prices have increased now. I was told the prices were kept low (under $12) as it was part of the NParks requirement in the tender for F&B to be affordable to the public using the park. So I do not know how it works since the prices have gone up slightly for some dishes, but not all. We ordered quite a fair bit of dishes and those I tried I liked. A dish which MUST order is the churros. While it is true that the cinnamon taste could be stronger, I am fine with the mild taste and generous coating of sugar. It is not super sweet and you could always remove the sugar if you like it with no sugar. I like how churro is hot and crispy on the outside. The dips are ok, dark chocolate is a bit too liquid so it tends to drip. The creme anglaise has a hint of lemon in it. The truffle egg cocotte has a strong truffle smell and taste which makes it really yummy. Unfortunately the parma ham is just a teeny tiny sliver which has no taste at all. The best looking brunch dish would be the French toast with garlic pork sausage, strawberries, sour cream and maple syrup. It tastes good too. The beef and guinness pie just looked very sad. Beef piled on top a pastry puff. Apparently the taste is bad too. The Grub cheeseburger is also very average. The crispy fish burger is the best of the lot. The Grub breakfast set is also not fabulous when compared to other places serving similar food. Roasted portobello is ok, you can't really go wrong with it though the rocket looks very wilted. I guess the food is hit and miss, depends on what you order. The iced honey lime juice is a misnomer as it comes with lemon juice. Too sour and acidic for the stomach. I think I am used to the less acidic taste of lime juice now. But if you want to dine at a casual place in the midst of greenery, I guess Grub is a good option."

I managed a couple of spoonfuls, but that was about it.the dark chocolate pot was essentially a pot of ganache - nothing wrong with that, of course, but I expected a little more finesse and a slightly more varied texture. that spicy cashew praline was a lightly chilli-spicy sandy, sugary mix - kind of interesting on the menu, but too reminiscent of sugar to eat too much of.the churros were also a bit dense, though the chocolate and creme anglaise it came with was decent at least. the best churros I've had are the disneyland ones - with crisp exteriors and fluffy interiors - and I can't seem to get to any restaurants or cafes which provide the same.so.. there's that. it's a pretty long walk through the park, and definitely not the easiest place to get to. I suggest getting your GPS on, as we lost our way and it was mad sweltering. I wish it had been a better experience - much like those I've seen on reviews when it first opened to large crowds - but what can you do?"

My friends and I were the first few customers in line so we were given a choice to seat either indoors or outdoors. Due to the heat wave that is going on these days we decided to sit indoors - more cooling.I was introduced to this place by a close friend and she tried the food and said it was good. The menu was one page laminated and I had to check on yelp on what's good to eat based on previous comments. I was baffled with fish burger or pork burger and I decided to try the pork one since I love grilled pineapples on top of my burger - reminds me of Islands in California.For the drink lime honey juice caught my eyes. The server came promptly to take our orders and repeated our orders once again to confirm.The drink came first. It is different from the normal lime juice I had outside. The honey is just right and the lime juice wasn't too sour or sweet for my taste - just right I could say.The food that we ordered came after awhile. I tried the fish burger and the cheeseburger as well as my own pork burger. Overall I still like the one I ordered. Tangy after taste.There were fries as the side dish. It is crunchy and not salty. There was a small serving of chilli sauce that came with it but I thought it was tomato sauce instead till I tried it. Overall it is a good place and quiet place to enjoy dinner. The price is a little pricey but I was very satisfied with the meal. Bon appetit! I'll definitely come back if I got a chance :)

Having said that, I think that this quaint little eatery in the park is perfectly...adequate. Adequate because their staff are not familiar with the menu and are not intuitive about things like filling empty water glasses or knowing when to remove plates, but they are enthusiastic and ask for feedback. Adequate because the food leans toward the Americana but I don't know if anyone in the kitchen has ever been to America or been trained in preparing authentic American fare, and the quality of product is average...but it is tasty if you're not expecting authenticity or high-end cuts of meat. I suppose for a neighborhood park restaurant, one really can't complain all that much. The food is very reasonably priced, the ambiance is lovely, and they are canine friendly. I truly hope that my experience tonight was purely due to opening jitters, because there is so much potential for the place. Tried:Chili Con Carne (under $10)Risotto (Around $10)Steak and Fries (Under $20)"

Don't get me wrong, I love porridge and I love marmite. So I like this dish in general, but it is not a risotto. Truffled egg cocotte is a great appetizer for people who like runny egg with bread. Like an angmo style of our kopitiam half-boiled egg. The other main course we tried was the slow roasted pork belly. This is different from the usual interpretation. The pork belly is all soft and yummy inside, and instead of the regular crisp from the skin, this is coated with a light layer of flour and fried. Thus, you get the whole pork belly crisp on the outside, all gelatinous goodness (also read as fats) inside. We like it enough, but didn't like the mango sauce was it was drizzled with. Next time, I would do it without the sauce. Dessert: most people are here for the churros. Yummy version here that is freshly fried upon ordering, fluffy and crispy. Given that not many places in Sg serves this, this is a good find. The only grip I have is the chocolate sauce that comes with it. They should have used better quality chocolate. This tasted cheap and it made an otherwise great dessert fall short.No reservations taken and the wait can be quite long. Good thing it is located in the park so you can go walk around while you wait. Get mozzie spray though, I filled quite many happy mozzie tummies while waiting."

Only the churros were disappointing - poorly fried so the inside was too wet and stodgy, and the chocolate sauce that comes with it had that cheap not-really-chocolate taste. Bleah :(The wait staff were nice and all, but service was bad. It made me wonder: were they even trained? The restaurant was pretty full for dinner, but the whole time, a whole cluster of wait staff just kept standing by the entrance, chatting away. They never paid attention to their tables, never came by to see if we needed anything, and never filled up our water glasses unless we waved madly at them. Our original waitress never even came back. There seemed to be only one guy that bothered, and he ran around doing all the work while the girls just stood around.We were also encouraged to order dessert up front so that we wouldn't have to wait so long. Guess what - we had to remind them twice about our dessert and we did wait a long time.It's really a shame. I liked the venue and the food wasn't bad at all. I won't go back for the bad service."

Not that I was late. People had been queuing before the door opens. The no-reservation policy can be a frustration for people who travel far to this park for the food. If I had not lived nearby, I would skip my 45-min wait and head nearby for roti prata. So here's our dinner: The Chilli con Carne ($8) was a simple appetizer of corn chips served with a stew of grass-fed beef chuck meat and beans. Served with sour cream and homemade green chimichurri, the blend of spices is weak and won't set your tongue ablaze.Main courses range from mediocre to good. The Smoked Pork Belly ($15) was the first to be delivered to our tables. On a bed of smooth mash potato, mango sauce and cherry tomatoes, the orange block of meat is like a body-builder with a gentle soul. With a right ratio of fats to meat, it neither overwhelms with grease nor engage the teeth in a laborious sawing job.On the other hand, the Pan Fried Salmon $15 seemed like reinventing the wheel with a different protein. Old friends like the mash potato (replaced the unavailable risotto) and the green chimichurri (from the Chilli Con Carne appetizer) met again to greet the salmon.Yet, another fish was terrific. The Crispy Fish Burger $12 was constructed with a perfectly deep-fried golden monkfish served on a bright, tart remoulade sauce. Fish varies daily so you may get cod or hake. We tried nearly everything on the dessert menu: Churros ($9) did not excite with any cinnamon aroma. The amount of sugar coating could have decreased, unlike those described in earlier online reviews. But the chocolate sauce was served cold, resulting in a rather glumpy, odd taste. My threshold for chocolate was put to the test by the chocolate pot $8 (see top pic). It would be mission impossible to wipe off the extremely dense bittersweet ganache without the spicy cashew praline crumbles. Though the Belgian waffles ($8) are not the crunchiest ones but at least, it had a sturdy structure with some slight browned edges and fluffy interior. Thankfully, the hazelnut ice cream came in a generous scoop to pair with the unsweetened dough.  The food here are normal western fare which can be found outside a park so patience is the key if one really wants to dine in here. So the next time if I return for brunch, I would be dressed in my sports attire and go jogging to kill the time."

Given last food orders are at 2pm, the wait staff were skeptical as to whether we would even get a chance to order... It was actually only a 25 minute wait so I guess Grub still need to work on their guesstimates on timing. I really like the space although I think the outdoor area has room for more seating. Funky industrial-chic with exposed brick. There is a large industrial kitchen full of kitchen staff and then a random open plan kitchen in the corner of the restaurant which they use for cleaning glasses and also patrons can sit at the counter to eat. Menu is very pub grub, diner-style fare. I did like the penchant for NZ beverages in there :-)We tried the cheeseburger, pork burger and the ""not yet on the menu"" chocolate mousse in a pot. I really enjoyed the cheeseburger, the pork burger was tender and tasty, and the dessert was a winner. The chocolate mousse was more of a ganache with a crunchy chilli-sweet crumb to mix in with it. Coffee was remarkably bad. Hence why I would call this place an 'eatery' rather than a 'cafe' given its inability to serve passable coffee. The honey and lime and juice was refreshing though. Service was still quite 'fresh' but enthusiastic and friendly. Water glasses were filled every now and again. Total bill approx $45 for two? The dinner menu looks a bit more varied (beyond burgers and eggs and waffles) and good value. I would be keen to go back to try it, although  I do find the location a bit out of the way and given you can't book... i might be taking a bit of a gamble to eat! Worth a look but perhaps go earlier on the weekends."

Honestly I eat A LOT of fries and Grub's fries are one of the better ones in town.We also had an iced honey lemon juice ($2.5) and this was weird. The honey taste is strong, the lime taste is strong, but there is a strange and lingering after taste!!Ended our meal with the Churros ($8) that EVERY single table seemed to have ordered. Maybe my boyfriend and I were too full but the law of diminishing returns set in after the second churro...... they're so heavy and so sweet. Turns out we are not churro people :(Anyway, this place is worth a try!! We stayed till 9.30pm (last order is at 9.45) but the place was still packed!! We were quite shocked that it's a weekday night in the middle of a dark park but there were still so many people waiting for a table and every table was occupied.I will definitely go back to try other things on their menu :) maybe you can say hi through my instagram photos at Grub hahahha!"

But these fries were oversalted considering that the accompanying mentaiko cream was also quite salty. Their cheese burger was underwhelming as the beef patty lacked a char flavour and was undersized compared to the bun it was served in. The flavour of the burger was just too ordinary and does not warrant any high praise. Th hightlight of my meal was the churros served with creme anglais and chocolate sauce. Good balance of crispyness and breadiness which went well with the accomoanying sauce. Perfect pairing with the coffee brewed at this place.

Two slices, a little syrup, sour cream(?) and mascerated strawberries(also ?) and a sausage - simple food, and tasty enough, so no complaints, but I'm not writing a postcard about them either. The Girlfriend's eggs en cocotte was a little underdone for our liking, and after reporting it to the staff, it came back similarly raw, so we gave it a go, but it was unsatisfying in my book.

Not that I was late. People had been queuing before the door opens. The no-reservation policy can be a frustration for people who travel far to this park for the food. If I had not lived nearby, I would skip my 45-min wait and head nearby for roti prata. So here's our dinner: The Chilli con Carne ($8) was a simple appetizer of corn chips served with a stew of grass-fed beef chuck meat and beans. Served with sour cream and homemade green chimichurri, the blend of spices is weak and won't set your tongue ablaze.Main courses range from mediocre to good. The Smoked Pork Belly ($15) was the first to be delivered to our tables. On a bed of smooth mash potato, mango sauce and cherry tomatoes, the orange block of meat is like a body-builder with a gentle soul. With a right ratio of fats to meat, it neither overwhelms with grease nor engage the teeth in a laborious sawing job.On the other hand, the Pan Fried Salmon $15 seemed like reinventing the wheel with a different protein. Old friends like the mash potato (replaced the unavailable risotto) and the green chimichurri (from the Chilli Con Carne appetizer) met again to greet the salmon.Yet, another fish was terrific. The Crispy Fish Burger $12 was constructed with a perfectly deep-fried golden monkfish served on a bright, tart remoulade sauce. Fish varies daily so you may get cod or hake. We tried nearly everything on the dessert menu: Churros ($9) did not excite with any cinnamon aroma. The amount of sugar coating could have decreased, unlike those described in earlier online reviews. But the chocolate sauce was served cold, resulting in a rather glumpy, odd taste. My threshold for chocolate was put to the test by the chocolate pot $8 (see top pic). It would be mission impossible to wipe off the extremely dense bittersweet ganache without the spicy cashew praline crumbles. Though the Belgian waffles ($8) are not the crunchiest ones but at least, it had a sturdy structure with some slight browned edges and fluffy interior. Thankfully, the hazelnut ice cream came in a generous scoop to pair with the unsweetened dough.  The food here are normal western fare which can be found outside a park so patience is the key if one really wants to dine in here. So the next time if I return for brunch, I would be dressed in my sports attire and go jogging to kill the time."

Don't get me wrong, I love porridge and I love marmite. So I like this dish in general, but it is not a risotto. Truffled egg cocotte is a great appetizer for people who like runny egg with bread. Like an angmo style of our kopitiam half-boiled egg. The other main course we tried was the slow roasted pork belly. This is different from the usual interpretation. The pork belly is all soft and yummy inside, and instead of the regular crisp from the skin, this is coated with a light layer of flour and fried. Thus, you get the whole pork belly crisp on the outside, all gelatinous goodness (also read as fats) inside. We like it enough, but didn't like the mango sauce was it was drizzled with. Next time, I would do it without the sauce. Dessert: most people are here for the churros. Yummy version here that is freshly fried upon ordering, fluffy and crispy. Given that not many places in Sg serves this, this is a good find. The only grip I have is the chocolate sauce that comes with it. They should have used better quality chocolate. This tasted cheap and it made an otherwise great dessert fall short.No reservations taken and the wait can be quite long. Good thing it is located in the park so you can go walk around while you wait. Get mozzie spray though, I filled quite many happy mozzie tummies while waiting."

Given last food orders are at 2pm, the wait staff were skeptical as to whether we would even get a chance to order... It was actually only a 25 minute wait so I guess Grub still need to work on their guesstimates on timing. I really like the space although I think the outdoor area has room for more seating. Funky industrial-chic with exposed brick. There is a large industrial kitchen full of kitchen staff and then a random open plan kitchen in the corner of the restaurant which they use for cleaning glasses and also patrons can sit at the counter to eat. Menu is very pub grub, diner-style fare. I did like the penchant for NZ beverages in there :-)We tried the cheeseburger, pork burger and the ""not yet on the menu"" chocolate mousse in a pot. I really enjoyed the cheeseburger, the pork burger was tender and tasty, and the dessert was a winner. The chocolate mousse was more of a ganache with a crunchy chilli-sweet crumb to mix in with it. Coffee was remarkably bad. Hence why I would call this place an 'eatery' rather than a 'cafe' given its inability to serve passable coffee. The honey and lime and juice was refreshing though. Service was still quite 'fresh' but enthusiastic and friendly. Water glasses were filled every now and again. Total bill approx $45 for two? The dinner menu looks a bit more varied (beyond burgers and eggs and waffles) and good value. I would be keen to go back to try it, although  I do find the location a bit out of the way and given you can't book... i might be taking a bit of a gamble to eat! Worth a look but perhaps go earlier on the weekends."

Having said that, I think that this quaint little eatery in the park is perfectly...adequate. Adequate because their staff are not familiar with the menu and are not intuitive about things like filling empty water glasses or knowing when to remove plates, but they are enthusiastic and ask for feedback. Adequate because the food leans toward the Americana but I don't know if anyone in the kitchen has ever been to America or been trained in preparing authentic American fare, and the quality of product is average...but it is tasty if you're not expecting authenticity or high-end cuts of meat. I suppose for a neighborhood park restaurant, one really can't complain all that much. The food is very reasonably priced, the ambiance is lovely, and they are canine friendly. I truly hope that my experience tonight was purely due to opening jitters, because there is so much potential for the place.

It was accompanied by a beautifully-concocted chilli sauce that was truly delicious and brought the chicken to a whole new level.There wasn't much selection at this particular stall besides the chicken and a few other choices, and we've pretty much tried it all. The vegetables were awesome, although the fish and tofu dishes fell a little flat. However, Lam's is supposed to be renowned for their abalone noodle which incorporates some fusion elements. Judging from their website, it also looks like the menu on the other side is a lot more extensive, and they have everything from abalone noodles to ramen. It definitely looks interesting, and if these other dishes are as delicious as their salt-baked chicken, I bet I'll be bowled over once again."

As the Chinese version of western afternoon tea, a good Dim sum place invites you to sit, relax and enjoy little plates of food at leisure. In Guang Zhou, the environment was lively with older men reading newspapers and younger crowds chatting away. This particular Coffeeshop dim sum reminded me of that environment with the added factor of people and car watching. Food wise, it was above average for certain. The Har gow has giant whole fresh prawns in it, with a crunch in the bite and at least 2 prawns in each. The Liu Sha Bao had a good amount of Liu Sha. My only gripe is that the skins for everything are too thick. Service was no fuss and quick. The drinks came from the Coffeeshop across the road, which we only discovered when we approached by the Uncle. Being a hot and sweaty weekday, there wasn't more than 4 people in sight at the Coffeeshop and we were able to enjoy a quiet and leisurely meal with idle conversation. I loved the atmosphere, though I suppose it'd be different and much more crowded during peak hours. Prices were slightly higher than your usual Kopitiam dim sum, but justified. The namesake comes from the restaurant in Hong Kong that the Chef had worked at before opening up this small Coffeeshop stall in Singapore. The same restaurant has now opened a (fairly expensive) branch in Singapore. If you want to avoid the queues and service charge, this makes a good alternative in my opinion."

The bun is stuffed with so much custard that it takes skills to open up the bun without spilling any of those precious liquid.

But they've upped their game with their pancake offerings!Savory pancakes ($11) - 5 starsMy first-world brunch problem has always been ""I really want the pancakes/French toast with caramelized bananas and ice cream but I'll feel sick after a few bites and wish I ordered something savory."" La Ristrettos solves this with their savory pancakes: two huge pancakes with a mass of scrambled eggs and bacon with a side of maple syrup. I asked if I could substitute the bacon for some sort of vegetable and the lady kindly offered spinach. The cherry (cheese) on top was that they cooked the spinach and garnished it with a dollop of ricotta. I suppose from bad experiences elsewhere I was expecting them to say no, or just give me a few token raw greens, so this was such a pleasant surprise. The scrambled eggs were creamy and substantial and the pancakes were gigantic and fluffy! These were the pancakes I'd expected Clinton St to have, and that I've been looking for! No more $20 tiny pancakes thank you.They also offer sweet pancakes with vanilla gelato and salted caramel that I'm going to have to come back to try."

And while I usually complain about the standard of coffee in cafes around Singapore, I also frown at the hefty price tags many popular coffee establishments place on my favourite caffeinated drink. I found out about this gem of a place by some chance encounter some years back and I remember being pleasantly surprised by how a cafe that actually got its coffee right was able to keep itself hidden in a little corner of a medical centre. While I feared that it would eventually close due to a lack of awareness from the community, I'm glad that it's not only doing well, but also getting a lot of positive attention (which it fully deserves) in recent years. The ambience here is classy. Very nicely spruced up decor - if the indoor seating gets a little too cramped, the outdoor area has plenty of sitting space too. The food here is a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth giving a shot. The coffee, however, is where it shines. Definitely one of my favourite coffee haunts in central Singapore."

First of all, the chances of finding this place is pretty low. It's in the most random location ever- the 8th floor of the fairly new Novena Medical Center. There are no advertisements around Square 2 or anywhere else around the medical center (at least, that I've noticed) so unless you have a doctor's appointment on the 8th floor, you'll never know this place even existed! But thanks to Yelp, you are now cooler and better person. :)I loved the ambiance of this place. It's quite cozy, with cute, vintage coffee signs on the walls. They have high-tech machines that make badass brews. The free pitchers of ice water with orange slices was a nice touch. They were also playing some classic Frank Sinatra while I was there, which put me in an even better mood. I wanted to have breakfast, but most of their breakfast offerings seemed too heavy for me. They had dishes like croissants and frittatas, but they all come with salads, which I simply wasn't in the mood for. (Also, who has salads for breakfast?!) I did see some smaller offerings in their counter, but it wasn't well labelled and I didn't feel like asking about them. I ended up settling for a banana and a cappuccino. I'm not a big coffee drinker, so all I can say is that I did enjoy my cappuccino and I thought it was fairly priced at $5. Bottom line, my first visit was a success. If they could offer smaller bakery items and free wifi, they would really win me over. If you have time before your medical appointment, or even if you're just hanging around the Square 2/Velocity/Tan Tock Seng area and you're craving an upscale coffee experience, ignore Starbucks and give La Ristrettos a try."

This building is directly connected to Novena MRT Station and it's very easy to find (just take the exit towards square 2). Not to worry, there are lots of parking lots in this building.It's a small and quiet cafe. Since this place is so secluded, there aren't a lot of customers especially during weekdays. This cafe is probably catered towards providing a nice and cozy environment for surgeons to take a break from their hectic schedules or to discuss some work over a nice cup of coffee. 3G reception is poor here, fortunately they provide free WiFi.They is a big table placed in the centre (that can probably fit 10 people) and a long table top (with red plastic chairs) facing the garden.The interior is filled with wooden furniture, with fake bricks embedded onto the walls. Outdoor seats are also available in the garden for you to breathe in some fresh air. Besides, this cafe is tax-free - you could save a couple of bucks!I ordered their Macchiato ($3.50). The coffee is smooth and tastes great. Could have been much better with some caramel to sweeten things up! I later found out that they are the sole distributor of Caffe Agust Beans which is an Italian coffee brand that is organic and certified 100% Fairtrade.I love the presentation of the food here! Food is served in brightly coloured dishes on a nice wooden tray. I tried their Grande breakfast set ($14.00). You have 3 choices for the egg (either poached, scrambled or sunny side). Served together with mushrooms, sausage, salad and 2 slices of sourdough. Sausage and salad dressing was good. However, bacon was burnt and quite tough. Poached eggs were a disappointment - it's overcooked!For coffee lovers, this is the place to go. Food is satisfactory, not good enough to keep me coming back. As for me, I think I'll only come back for their coffee, provided I'm around the area.Signing Off,Zhan HaoFounder of TheCafection"

The inside is quite small and cosy, but the limited space is put to good use. A communal table lies in the centre of the room, flanked by counter seats, and a door that leads to a shaded outdoor seating area. Tampers and espresso shot cups line the shelves, while the staff pull shots at an open bar counter lined with espresso machines and grinders. I like the concept - it's always interesting to see the baristas at work, and for coffee geeks, to see the shots themselves being pulled. This can tell you a lot about the quality of coffee at a cafe - a spaghetti strand sized column of dark black liquid slowly lining a shot cup is a sign of good underlying espresso, while a 10 second downpour of pale brown liquid is a hint that you should quietly slip out the entrance without waiting for your drink. Fortunately, La Ristretto's shots were good examples of the former, with a 20 second extraction of potent espresso.  The espresso shot had a medium brown crema, and a robust, full bodied flavour with distinct hints of chocolate. It was bright without being bitter, and potent without being burnt. The shot glass of water on the side is a nice touch also, and was used, as the serving size is a little larger than usual for a single shot. The coffee beans used were from Agust coffee roasters in Italy, which I haven't come across in Asia before, and are quite distinct in their own right. It's also interesting to be able to sample a robust Italian style espresso, which contrasts with the trend for citrusy single origin shots that are on offer in a number of cafes at present. The latte that I ordered had smooth foam, and a large serving size. It was quite mild, but the underlying espresso shot was muted rather than being completely lost, and could easily be detected in the aftertaste.  This may be the result of the larger espresso shot sizes mentioned earlier. The overall character was of coffee rather than milk, so despite the serving size, it avoids the easy mistake of serving warm caffeinated warm milk, rather than coffee. The foam maintained it's integrity throughout, without breaking up - a small detail, but one that's consistent with correct steaming temperature and duration, and something that I've seen a few cafes get wrong in recent weeks.There is a good coffee menu on offer, with the usual combinations of espresso and milk, and brewed coffees. One thing that differs is the presence of shakerato on the menu (a shaken cold espresso), that I have not seen before, and something that I'm genuinely curious to see made. Prices were as expected, at 8.50 for the latte and espresso above.Overall, La Ristretto's is interesting in that they are serving something genuinely different, and it's an opportunity to try a fairly authentic Italian espresso. The location may be an issue for some, in that it's in the middle of a medical centre, rather than in a standalone cafe. This should not deter you from visiting during non peak hours however, especially if you happen to be in the area. However do bear in mind that the cafe itself is quite small, so please let patients and staff take priority!"

It has been here for several years and it generally serves the neighbourhood of Yio Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio and caters for traditional Chinese weddings.Imperial Court Shark's Fin Restaurant is owned by Gim Tim and has been around since 1975. Gim Tim is also one of the pioneer in the mobile kitchen arena, it has a fleet to cater for outdoor function.The dining area isn't the biggest but they have private rooms lining the entire dining area. On a weekday lunch at 12pm, we were one of 4 tables of dinners. It is definitely very quiet during the weekday and you can enjoy the peace and quiet while having dim sum.Their dim sum menu is pretty small but do not be initimidated. Having patronized their dim sum over the past 4 years. I am convinced that their dim sum quality outshines more chained competitors.1. Prawn Fritter with Fruit Juice $4.20++The prawn fritter was served with apple sauce! That's right! Apple sauce! It was a very sweet and syrupy sauce that gave the salty and yet juicy prawns a tangy taste! This is a very sweet and yet savoury dish! The prawn fritters are wrapped with a seaweed skin, much like the Japanese seaweed chicken!Prawn Fritter with Fruit JuiceThe seaweed skin gives the prawn fritter a crispier and crunchier texture upon each bite!2. Crispy Bean Curd Skin with Prawn $4.20++This is my typical favourite, served with mayonnaise. This was freshly fried to perfection. You could tell from the piping hot steam coming out of ths prawns as they cut it up with a scissors in front of you. The prawns were succulent and juicy and they were pretty sizeable as well!3. Pan Fried Carrot Cake $3.80++ *highly recommended*Their pan fried carrot cake is one of the best I've had! The exterior was charred perfectly to give it a slightly crisp exterior and yet still leaving the carrot shreds soft and moist! They were also cubes of char siew embedded in the carrot cake! A very delightful savoury dim sum which is pretty above average!4. Steamed Chang Fen with Char Siew $4++I had better expectations of this but ths skin wasn't thin enough and the sauce wasn't salty enough. The char siew was it's saving grace.5. Steamed Chang Fen with Shrimp $4++They have a lobster option for this but luckily we went with the cheaper shrimp option since I didn't quite like the steamed chang fen skin much. It was too thick and it couldn't absorb the sauce. Hence the chang fen just tasted bland.6. Steamed Shanghai Dumpling (Xiao Long Bao)  $4.50++My favourite dim sum item that arrived last. It tasted okay. Nothing spectacular.Steamed Shanghai Dumpling (Xiao Long Bao)The soup in the xiao long bao had enough flavour and meat.7. Spare Rib in Black Bean Sauce $4.20++The meat was tasty and savoury. But though the came in large chunks with alot of fats. The sauce was also overly oily. 8. Pan Fried Chilli Crab Bun $4.20++This was an interesting dish and I ordered it out of plain curiousity. It is a pan fried bun and hence the bottom is charred!On the inside, you start to see the chilli crab, which looks to me they used alot of tumeric.Inside the bun, you can see shreds of crab meat and also a small slice of crab stick. Overall, it was too spicy for me and I had to wash it down with my pot of chrysanthemum tea. Nonetheless, if you can take spicy foods, do give this a try!9. Steamed Custard Bun $4++Probably my most favourite dim sum of the day. They were perfectly round and when they were served to us, they were too hot to be touched! On the inside, liquid gold, salted egg yolk sweet goodness flowed out!The texture and the thickness of the bun was spot on and the sweetness of the liu sha was perfect! Probably one of the best liu sha buns I've had!The service here was excellent on a weekday lunch since there weren't many customers. Most of the staff here speak cantonese, mandarin and english. They were very friendly in recommending items and explaining their promotions. They were also quick to top up drinks and clear dirty dishes.For about $25/pax for dim sum of this quality in an air conditioned area, I must say, this is one of the most value for money and yet quality dim sum places!"

However, it does not sell Sichuan cuisine dishes anymore, but specializes in Chengdu Hot Pot nowadays after a company called T-One Steamboat bought the restaurant. They have now opened a new outlet, Chengdu Bareheaded Spicy Crab located just across the street which sells Sichuan cuisine dishes. The taste of the hot pot here is authentic, and I believe the restaurant isn't recycling the chilli oil to save production costs, since I have never had diarrhoea after eating hot pot here. It is also worth mentioning that this restaurant was awarded grade A by the National Environmental Agency of Singapore in terms of its hygiene standards. Waiters and waitresses here are polite, patient and helpful. A few of them are in fact native Chengdunese and it is a pleasure, indeed heartwarming, to conversing with them in Sichuan dialect. Mapo Doufu charges S$18.80 per person and you can order as much as you want  as long as the ingredients are available on their menu and your stomach is not full. Most of the common ingredients found in Chengdu Hot Pot restaurants such as sweet potato vermicelli can be found, but the delicious asparagus lettuce is missing. You need to pay S$0.50 for the free flow of plain water per person. However, you need to remind the waitresses to refill the glass as they do not seem to notice it. Other drinks are sold separately. The restaurant also puts up a poster telling customers that Wahaha Nutri-Express is sold here. Yet the actual bottle of Nutri-Express you get is only about half the size of the Nutri-Express commonly seen in China's supermarkets."

The concept of this place is ""farm to table"" fare. Wildseed is the cafe at the far end of the building and open in the day, and The Summerhouse is the restaurant on the second floor. The cafe walls are lined with greenery and there's a ground floor dining area at the main building.Trying the brunch items of grilled beef pita and wurstbrot, I was impressed with the freshness of the bread and combination of flavors. However, the sides such as the fries were too charred for my liking and overall, the pricing was a bit high.Rounding off the meal, the Citronella Passionfruit Cheesecake had great texture and a good balance of cheese and lemon. This I felt was the best item so far. The only issue here is the spotty service and inconsistent food, which I attribute to the being short handed due to the long lines and large crowds on weekends. I spotted harried crew members running about and exasperated looks from the chefs in the kitchen.Since the opening in January, word has spread about this place and weekends here are extremely crowded with long lines and very limited space for parking. As of writing, not all the buildings in the area are currently open, and I fear the kind of crazy crowd situation as the restaurants and bars progressively open.Not worth it to make your way here to wait in line for more than half an hour.

Service was friendly, they mixed up an order for us but when notified of it, they quickly made a change with no hassle. ok efficient at the order, It was crowded on Sunday before 12 and lines started to build. Reservations are encouraged. The menu was substantial, with a mix of breakfast and lunch items. We had the sea bass, Thai chicken noodle salad and the Chicken Pita. Drinks were elder flower coffee and the avocado shake. Food was generally good. Portions were substantial. The sea bass was well cooked and really very good. The curly fries that came with the pita were excellent. Retaining its crispness throughout the meal. The coffee flavor wise  was good, but for me a little sweet. Next time I would order it with no sugar as it comes with a meringue floated on top which was itself sweet. The avocado shake was excellent, refreshing and surprisingly lite. I had expected it to be overly rich but turned out perfect. For dessert  we had the pea flower gula Melaka muffin and rojak banana loaf. Nothing special frankly, the muffin texture was too dense, although the flavor was alright. The banana loaf was better. Based on the 2 desserts I would say that the food is Better than the desserts. I rate this place 3 stars though in truth it's more 31/2, rated down because of the marginal desserts. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and I am encouraged to try the dinner at Summer House next door.

He announced that a la carte was unavailable that night and we had to select a 3, 5 or 10 course pre fixe.

Hard to make a decision if you don't know what you are getting.  When the dishes were served some of the dishes were presented without explanation. From taste and observation almost all the items served were identical to what was on their a la carte menu! So why couldn't he refer me to the menu when I asked for a description?! After telling us we did not have a choice in our 10 course meal, he came and asked what we would like for dessert which was our last course. Confused, we asked what does the chef recommend. His response was heavy or light? He finally brought two types of desserts alternating the desserts  between guests so one guest got the heavy cream while the other got the light fruit but no one was given a choice on which they wanted.

Also, service: I took my dish to the counter and pointed out that I had Mac but no Cheese.  I was told by the hostess to go tell the chef.  She then turned back to gazing towards the car park.  I was a little puzzled but prepared to march into the kitchen uninvited.  As I made my way to the kitchen, I was stopped by a waiter.  I asked him if he knew what Mac and Cheese was.  He said yes.  We both looked at my plate.  He then took my plate from me and went into the kitchen.  It later returned with massive shavings of some tasteless cheese.  I didn't even finish half of it."

Beautiful surroundings spoiled by a really horrible ""dining"" experience.  Ok, it is a pub/cafe, but the prices they charge deserve at least edible food and a reasonable level of service.  The experience starts with you being directed to stand and queue near the entrance where unchilled cakes wilted near the cash register. You are then expected to order and pay before you can sit and enjoy the ambience.  (Afterwards I realised that if you did not pay first, you certainly would not want to pay once you had tried the food),The Fed-Up fries certainly made us fed up.  Curly fries with a mix of foul dressings which made me think kindly of McDonald's version.  The dressing that tasted like ketchup with curry powder mixed in, is particularly disgusting.  Those curly fries follow you like a bad smell onto the main course where a potato side consists of more of them with a cheese dressing which probably was squeezed from a tube .  Paired with a ""German"" sausage which had a tough skin and a filling like loose dog food. The taste...well I have never eaten dogfood.  The place is ""Dog Friendly"" so maybe we read the wrong menu.The $16 spread of nachos, with more of that cheese squeeze, cheap chips and popcorn is possible the worst value for money in a very overpriced joint.  We have never left/wasted so much food while eating out. In this case, it was the only sensible thing to do.  And of course none of the staff asks you if you enjoyed the meal.  They already know the answer."

We ordered:Beef Bolognese - the Spag is cooked a dente and the sauce is ok. But it's a case of sauce over noodles and tossed over. The taste of the sauce doesn't 'drape' over the noodles so its kinda like the ones you find in food courts/hawker stalls. Can skip this one the next time. Mushroom Soup - this came first and my 2 piranhas finished it before I could get my spoon in! It's either it's damn good or boy were they hungry. New Yoke Strip - essentially a larger piece of sirloin and I had it with coleslaw and potato salad. Prime Ribeye Extra Cut - My hub is a fan of meat, beef in particular. Astons for him is good as its value-for-money for a generally ok cut of beef slab with two sides. Sausage Platter - there are 3 different sausages in the platter and I liked the darker ones better. The lightest one I think was chicken and found it rather bland. My daughter turned out to be a fan and abandoned her own food to attack mine. Astons is not certainly not gourmet but a good place for a hearty meal while your kids will love the play area next door more!"

So finally I've decided that it's time for me to check out this restaurant. So we came all the way to their Toa Payoh branch cos we heard that over there has a much lesser queue, which was true when we came. We came on a Sunday around 7.30 pm, with a group of 2, we got seat right away upon arriving. Overall I'm personally really pleased with my dining experience here. Though this place was busy, we got our orders correctly and very fast. We waited less than 15 mins for all of our orders which was perfect cos we came HUNGRY. Taste wise they were very nice. I could easily tell that those food must be prepared on the spot upon receiving our order. The texture of the dumpling skin was great. It didn't break easily when I picked it up, and it's chewy and there is no weird (preservative) after taste like you'd taste in a cheap dim sum stalls. Price wise, everything belongs to the steep side, but I'd say it's worth the money.We ordered: beancurd skin with pork & shrimp (S$5.00); prawn dumpling (S$6.00); pork dumpling with shrimp (S$5.50); vermicelli roll with shrimp (S$6.00); steamed spinach dumpling with shrimp (S$3.80); and congee (S$4.50). We both are pleased with each of every one of them :)I made a mental note that next time I am coming here, I'd order pork steamed bun in which everyone seems to have on their table. I didn't order it cos I was way too full then. I gave this place 4 stars cos knowing that this place is 1 star michelin restaurant, so I have held my expectations high. I was kinda hoping that this place would blow my mind away.. but it didn't. So there, 4 stars only for now :p"

Also a first for me - didn't have hot tea with my dim sum ... and survived. See, it's good to mix things up from time to time. The dim sum selection were varied (rice, noodles, jook, veggies, dessert, etc.) so there's something for everyone. But gosh, that baked char siew bun - so good! Everything was served hot and service was quick. This lunch was the best I've had in awhile. I'm a happy camper."

Totally pleased that on my most recent visit, they now have 5 locations island-wide to ease the demand. Michelin star dim sum; no queue! That was my experience at the Toa Payoh branch. We got here shortly after 11 or so on a weekday and it filled up around noon but totally dissipated after 1pm. If you avoid the lunch hour you should be good in terms of a line. Holy mother of BBQ pork buns - Tim Ho Wan's are simply divine. The slightly crispy exterior disguises how fluffy and pillowy it is and the BBQ pork filling hits the right balance between sweet and savory. Order more than you think you want. They even carry well so get some to go. We ordered a lot of food between the three of us. Other notable standouts include the shrimp and BBQ pork vermicelli rolls, siew mai, har gao, turnip cake, and tofu skin rolls. Even items that were unmemorable like the Teochew dumpling and glutinous rice were still pretty good dishes. Honestly not a bad bite of food to be had during this meal. If the long lines dissuaded you before, head over to the other branches to experience Michelin star dim sum, and in particular those BBQ pork buns, sans queue."

Super wet and yummy fillings inside soft buns with crusty outer layer. Wasabi Salad PrawnSomehow the end product doesn't match my mental picture of dish. So it's essentially deep fried dumplings with juicy prawns stuffed inside. Outside they added a layer of wasabi Mayo sauce. The wasabi is not spicy at all, this dish was slightly underwhelming for me. Spicy Prawn Paste Char Siew NoodleI can't make out the Prawn Paste taste but the noodle is well fried with the appropriate wok-Hei. This is not to say this was bad. Not bad, a decent (small) plate of fried noodle. Will return to try the other more dim-sum-y items the next time."

For those of you hiding under the foodie rock, THW is the famous Hong Kong Mongkok Michelin star dim sum wonder. Having never been to the original, I do not have a benchmark to weigh it against. However, quality and prices makes it rank pretty high in terms of local dim sum standards. Their 'Big 4 Heavenly Kings' though isn't really worth the hype. I actually prefer some of the other dishes.

I am convinced the bottleneck is not in the kitchen or with the service... it's simply that customers cannot chew and swallow their food fast enough! Hence, the lines. Sadly, if only humans had wider esophagus and didn't feel the need to make small talk over meals. Just kidding!"

Wouldn't queue 2 hours but I heard that the Toa Payoh one was alright weekday off-peak and accordingly, went at 1420 on a Monday. We had to wait about 15 minutes which was pretty manageable. The restaurant is bright and features many long tables, so unless your group is large you have to share tables. Essentially there isn't much of an ambiance to speak off (bar a general bustling feel which is kind of nice) so it's all about the food. We obviously got the ""four heavenly kings"" (their signature dishes)The char siew bun lives up to all the hype. The bun is sweet and is just the perfect texture with a nice amount of char siew inside. The Ma Lai Gou (steamed egg cake) is light, fully and sweet. More of a dessert but also excellent.The carrot cake was probably the best I've ever had. Super soft while managing to have a large amount of radishes it was just so good.I thought the cheong fun was alright. The pig liver cheong fun is the 4th speciality dish. I only ate half because I'm not such a big fan of liver. We also got a prawn cheong fun. The texture of the skin is really good but that's about it.In terms of other dishes, everything we ordered was solid. Har Gao was the other standout where the texture of the skin being perfect made it possibly the best I've had. And really the siu mai was the only disappointing thing because it was pretty normal.I'm already planning another visit."

The queue at Plaza Singapura for the first few weeks was so long one needs to wait for hours to go in. I finally was able to try their food when I decided to visit this outlet at Toa Payoh when I heard they opened. Priority were given to ERA agents (not surprising, since Tim Ho Wan is owned by Hersing Corporation, who owns ERA as well) and that the rest will have to wait at the join-in queue (on a Saturday there weren't much ERA agents around).The Glutinous Rice Dumpling took me by surprise. My initial thoughts before having it that the glutinous rice taste, being infused with the lotus leaf's fragrance will overpower the taste of the ingredients inside. The ones here is a strong combination of tastes between the lotus-leaf infused glutinous rice, chicken and mushrooms.The Prawn Dumpling should never be missed out in a dim sum restaurant. The differences between the ones here and elsewhere is that the ones here are the prawns used are slightly bigger and more juicier.The Pork Dumpling with Shrimp should also never be missed out in a dim sum restaurant.The Pan Fried Carrot Cake is soft and moist and the radish taste was rather apparent.No one should ever leave here without ordering the Baked Bun with BBQ Pork. The outside of the bun is very crusty and tasted great. The BBQ Pork is even better. Well-marinated, it was sweet and meaty. This is a perfect combination.The Vermicelli Roll with BBQ Pork was well-executed. The vermicelli roll is thin, the BBQ pork was juicy and succulent.The Tonic Medlar & Osmanthus Cake (Cold) is a great dessert to end off the dim sum feast with. With a jelly-like texture consisting of wolfberries and osmanthus, it tasted sweet and refreshing.The Chinese Tea is refillable and is always a refreshing drink to order in any dim sum places.If you are around Toa Payoh, do visit the outlet here as they have branch-exclusive food items!"

I first visited in Hong Kong a few years ago, and loved it so much. It has now opened in Singapore to much the same fanfare and queues that the Hong Kong branches enjoy. The first thing you'll notice when you visit this Toa Payoh branch is that there are actually seats for the queue and cordoned off areas. Guess the orderliness of the British empire have much deeper seated roots here than in Hong Kong. As with all other Tim Ho Wans, you'll have to ensure that your party is already there and waiting or else they won't seat you. One would think an outfit almost 1600 miles away would not be able to hold a candle to the original outfits and certainly more expensive. However, this is not the case with the Toa Payoh branch. The Cheong Fun is in fact much better than a couple of the outlets in Hong Kong and has a more delicate cheong fun skin and a more refined seasoning of the pig liver filling. The baked pork buns (or baked char siew pau) are a mixed bag. I love the fact that the ones in Singapore are much ""fluffier"" and melt more in your mouth, but the filling is certainly not as flavourful nor as plentiful as the Hong Kong counterparts. Things to definitely order are the Baked Pork Buns, the Cheong Fun, Congee, the Osmanthus cake,  and the Siew Mai, and Har Gao (shrimp and pork / shrimp dumplings). The prices here are much comparable to that of Hong Kong, a couple things are cheaper and a couple more expensive (generally meat related products are more expensive in Singapore than they are in Hong Kong). All in all, a full serving will set you back about $15SGD (or £7.50 or USD$12.50) which in all honesty, is not bad for a Michelin starred dim sum restaurant. Beware though, the queues can get really bad, and it's not unheard of to be waiting in line for about an hour before you even get the opportunity to be seated. If you're looking at visiting the Plaza Singapura branch, wait times there can stretch from an hour and a half to two hours."

Neither have I patronized the outlet at Plaza Singapura. So I was very happy to try the food at their second outlet at Toa Payoh Central before I left this sunny island. One dish that I found interesting was the Ham Sui Gok 咸水角 or Deep Fried Dumpling with Salted Meat ($3.80). I've seen those with a thicker glutinous crust but the version here is thin and hollow. The more I chew, the more I appreciate the tinge of sweetness that trickles out from the fritter as it allows me to take a much desired sweet break from the savoury food. Not enough meat? Well, the amount works for me.The Fried Noodle with BBQ pork and Soy Sauce 叉烧鼓油皇炒面 ($6.00) lacked the wok-hei aroma and was too greasy. The light brown gravy drenched on top of the 大排檔猪肠粉 Vermicelli Roll ($4.20) tasted more like peanut butter than sesame sauce to me. The downside of this filling-less roll is that the rice sheets tend to dry out after sitting out in the air-conditioned dining area.Of course, the most star-worthy dish was the 酥皮焗叉烧包 Baked Bun with BBQ Pork ($4.50 for a portion of 4). I can't tell how authentic this is but some said it is closer than the P.S. outlet version to the original bun in Hong Kong. Apparently, the recipe has been tweaked.The crust was extremely thin and evenly wrapped around the bread, unlike typical HK Polo Bao that comes with a lumpy surface. And it was so fragile and flaky that it disintegrated as easily as sand castles on the beach. Both the char siew filling and bun was not too sweet and actions speak louder than words--I wolfed down 3 entire buns.And I love the Steamed Egg Cake香滑马拉糕 $3.80, which resembled our Chinese huat kueh but this was way fluffier and not too sweet at all. The aroma of brown sugar that wafted into my face was so enticing that I happily cleared the entire block of sponge cake by myself (my partner was too full) plus some leftover from another table. This definitely marked another climax of that day after having the char siew bao."

For those of you hiding under the foodie rock, THW is the famous Hong Kong Mongkok Michelin star dim sum wonder. Having never been to the original, I do not have a benchmark to weigh it against.

I am not sure why, but my impression of teochew food was pretty bad and when my dad told me that he made a reservation for dinner at a teochew restaurant, I was expecting a pretty blend dinner with lots of steamed and mushy food.I could not have been more wrong. Located in an otherwise deserted building known as Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, Fragrant Garden with its bright green sign is the only sign of life in the shopping centre on a Saturday evening. The boss of the restaurant came to chat with us while we were deciding what to order and helped us by recommending the dishes we should get. While most stall owners tend to push their most expensive dish and try to sell you the biggest serving of each dish, the boss was very considerate towards our personal taste preference and took the effort to recommend how much of each dish to order so that we would have just the right amount of food. His estimation was brilliant, as we were full and satisfied as we finished all the food on the table. The food is also very reasonably priced and definitely a lot more worth than most fancy teochew restaurants located in posh places.Their steamed fish in soup was fantastic as the fish was very fresh and the soup was flavourful. We also had pork cutlet, fried oyster omelette, braised duck, sambal asparagus and fried kailan. All the dishes were delicious but the one that stood out the most was the oyster omelette. The starch was just chewy enough without being tough, with the egg fried well and crisp and the oysters being big and fresh.I had a great dinner and my impression of teochew cuisine has officially changed for the better."

Its just a lovely beef patty, gorgeous mushrooms and melted cheese with that awesome garlic aoli. Its simple yet heavenly.My friend ordered the Fat Basterd and he opened up the burger, seperated each level of the burger and very methodically ate each ingredient on its own. I guess Fatboy's gives people the opportunity to enjoy their food in a very innovative way. LOL."

I found that out the first time I made a trip down to the outlet located in Upper Thomson. My fellow foodie Jeffrey had heard about it and was eager to give the burgers a try. While there are other offerings on the menu, we were very focused on our goal to test the burgers and subs out. What made it even more special was the opportunity to build our very own burger. Imagine a burger that has what you like. I was immediately sold on that and decided to build my own.The burgers were delivered and were instantly devoured by the both of us. Portions were huge and I can remember that I instantly made a mental note to come back should I have a burger craving. The sub we had was pretty decent, together with an assortment of appetizers. I would suggest sticking to the burgers as they do that very well. The subsequent visits we made were to try out their speciality burgers and guess what, they rock as well! But still nothing beats the burgers we customized ourselves!"

It's actually too big for my liking as I have difficulties finishing it so I normally go for the smaller version, which is named ""Wimpy"". Good thing is Wimpy comes in 3 choices of patty i.e. pork, beef or lamb.Their chips ain't great but the burgers more than make up for it. Best in this little red dot in my humble opinion."

I have been here several times and tried a variety of their burgers - chicken and beef patty doused in various sauces  - and by far, I still love their beef patty the most. It's moist, soft, juicy and consistent. For the price you are paying, I say its a pretty fantastic burger and meal."

I'll recommend this to anyone who wants to be slighty adventurous....Well I just wanted to go with a safe burger this time round so... HOLY CAESER ($12). It was goooood.... The chicken was done perfectly! I've eaten at The Handburger before and this was comparable! Huge serving of straight cut, chunky fries.
