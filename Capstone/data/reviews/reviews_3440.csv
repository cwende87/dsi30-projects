It started with the preserved duck egg which I would actually recommend (just don't ask for a full description until after you eat it!). For the entree we had chicken rice which was awesome. I definitely recommend this for a local meal. We also had the green dragon vegetables (delicious!) and a tofu soup that was awesome. The overall restaurant was very nice and clean and clearly it's a place that locals frequent. I would definitely recommend for a sit down meal and good local flavors.

Boon Tong Kee is often regarded as one of local favorite spots where families and friends gather for good times over delicious Cantonese home-style food. Many regulars come to Boon Tong Kee primarily for their Signature Boiled Chicken or Famous Chicken Rice, also known for its silky white sauce chicken rice. Although chicken is the signature dish here, there is a wide selection of irresistible creations you wouldn't want to miss out. Some of the notable mentions such as Fried Bean Sprouts with Salted Fish, Fried Assorted Vegetables (Kang Kong) with Sambal, Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Eggs and Crispy Deep Fried Chicken are quite popular. The options are simply too many to list... if you have the appetite and the belly, I'd say explore and try as much as you can indulge."

Went thru the menu but It took a full 8 mins before our order was taken. The restaurant was not that full. A couple who came after us was served before us. My wife wanted to walk out, but as good people, we waited. Finally the chicken dish arrived and we tucked in to succulent meal.

The other stuff they try to push on you is passable but just stick with the chicken rice and all will be well. Came here on the second day of CNY and the line was insane with over an hour wait. We had heard the claypot rice here was quite popular and thus we ordered ahead while waiting for our table so the timing synced up. Alas, the claypot rice is alright but very forgettable. But the dependable staples didn't disappoint. Love the fragrant savory rice here. I can eat bowls of it! Paired with the silken white skin and moist chicken, it just works. Another staple, that fried tofu. Impeccable delicate and soft on the inside with a light crispy exterior. I don't know how it holds its texture but when dipped in the salad dressing, so yummy! Oh and that char siew that's already on your table when you're seated... it's just sublime. Being CNY, we also ordered lo hei for some festive cheer and our server was really personable in preparing it. But for everyday classics that won't disappoint, the chicken rice, fried tofu, and char siew are winners for sure. Also this location is open late which is a plus for supper cravings."

The restaurant is clean and the staff have the usual stiff upper lip until you warm them up with some ""xie xie's"" and attempting to banter with them. We of course ordered a plate of HC which come with individual bowls of rice (hells yeh). The chicken never fails, especially when you top it off with ginger, sweet soy and chilli. We also ordered a range of dishes from fried tofu (hells yes), baby spinach with salted and century egg, a Cantonese fave, broccoli and mushrooms, ""gourmet"" fried spring rolls and the seafood horfun. Special shout outs to the tofu which was light with the perfect amount of salty coating and the horfun. Sweet baby J, the horfun was to die for. The sheets themselves were the fattest I've seen. The seafood fresh. The sauce, solid. I was so full but kept going back for more. Downside: A LOT of MSG. MSG is killing my food vibe in Singapore.

Flaky , moist and just seasoned right. The sauce didnt overpower and just the right amount. It was delish.

After declining, I asked for iced water and instead got some weird coconut drink. If you can't even understand the word ""water"" that's definitely a problem. She did manage to get the rest of our order correct, probably because I pointed on the menu.Despite this, my dad truly enjoyed it, and our bill was under $20.

Unfortunately, it's a little far for me to constantly visit them but they are still one of my favorite chicken rice restaurants to visit when I have the craving. With all the chicken rice stalls and restaurants popping up, with one receiving a Bib Gourmand from Singapore's Michelin guide, what differentiates Loy Kee from the rest of the pack?Why it is still my Go To place for chicken rice. Firstly, the rice. Unlike most places that tend to offer healthier options these days, Loy Kee doesn't. Is it sinful? YES! But it's also bursting with flavour and nothing makes me happier than having oily lips with every mouthful of rice (best time to kiss a loved one). The Chicken. What's popular now is boneless chicken rice, where they skillfully remove all the bones, either from the breast or thighs and serve it beautifully presented on a plate. I, on the other hand, love picking meat of the bones as that's where all the flavours are. Despite being a huge boiled chicken fan, I really love the roasted chicken here. The skin is nice and tasty yet the meat remains juicy and tender. We also get more consistency with the roasted chicken as we tend to realize that the boiled chicken is a bit of a hit and miss, with it sometimes being juicy and tender and other times overcooked and dry. The SoupsAnother trademark of Loy Kee is their soups, with watercress soup being the most popular. The soups are not MSG ladened and my favourite has to be their watercress soup. Served as an individual double boiled bowl or in a traditional soup pot if you order for 2 or more (those old traditional ones our grandmother's used to cook over charcoal), the umami-ness of the pork and the sweetness of the watercress are infused wonderfully into a delightful soup, making it the perfect companion to the chicken rice. The Condiments A chicken rice is only as good as the condiments it comes with and nothing is more important than the holy trinity, Chicken Rice Chilli, Minced ginger and Dark Soy Sauce.While I find the chilli and dark soy sauce here pretty average, the ginger is very nice and adds an even deeper dimension when eaten with the rice. Overview. Again, it's up to personal preference but we really love the rice here and the chicken is good too. Paired along with a soup and the condiment and it makes for one of the best chicken rice in Singapore."

Was it? They need to rename the restaurant.Chicken was nice (definitely not ""the best"") but the portions were too small.  Rice was nice and shiny but lacking any moisture, like it's been sitting around for awhile. The accompanying soup was a notch better than most chicken rice joints. It contained bits of green onions, tomato, and tofu. Unlike some places where it just seems to be a bowl of water from boiling the chicken. Like the option of indoor or outdoor seating. Nice clean shop. Old school decor. Solid seats and tables. The weirdest part about the whole dining experience at Loy Kee was the wait service. We sat down, the waitress handed us the menus, then just stood there waiting to take our order. Usually I'd asked for a few minutes, but this time I decided not to say anything. A couple of minutes passed and I could hear her sighing. That's when I decided to start reading from the menu again ... from the beginning. Thanks for making your customers feel they chose the right place to eat tonight.

RIce is good, not exceptional. It is of a smaller shorter grain. The roasted chicken is better than the steamed chicken, which is quite dry in my opinion. The sauces were given on those small trays and it is very hard to get the attention of the servers to give me more sauce. I asked once and was not given the extra sauces that I asked for. I did not try other dishes. Hence, my review is purely based on the chicken rice & the service only, I will not come back to Balestier just for Loy Kee chicken rice because about 100 metres away, there is Boon Tong Kee, which is way better than this."

I have eaten here probably 15-20 times over the past 6 months. The quality is consistently great and for a restaurant where they serve you, it is frankly underpriced, probably because they are making a dish that is so abundantly available at hawker centers.In and of itself, this place is awesome. The roasted chicken rice is tender and juicy. The bok choy has a lot of those crispy onions on it. They must cook the rice in coconut oil or something for it to taste that good. The only mild downside is that I often want more of the condiments than they give on the tray, especially the thick black vinegar."

But now it has since expanded to Changi and now Novena, the queues are not as bad as it used to be.I happened to walk past the outlet at Novena. The queues only had about 6 customers in front. Maybe because it already 9pm, right the peak dinner time. The queue moved quite fast and the staff at the counter was friendly.I decided on the 3 pieces Chicken Joy meal which costs $9.50. It came with a drink and a side. For side there choices of plain rice, french fries, mashed potato and buttered corn. For drink, there was various choices such as Pepsi, 7-up, Mug and mountain dew.The chicken pieces were available in 2 flavours : original and spicy. I had selected the original. The chicken pieces were quite chunky and meaty.The fried chicken went quite well with the brown gravy sauce."

The smoke was a cool gimmick, but the cocktail needs to still be drinkable and in this case it wasn't. And the quote objectifying women on the mirrored wall was a bit of a turnoff (""Men:  No clothes, no drinks; Ladies"" No clothes, free champagne""), especially for a bar going for such a classy, hipster vibe.  Not super cool.  Still, liked the place and will probably come back on my next visit to Sg."

The safer way to tell which stall is good will be by how long the line is.I only tried the food twice since the renovation. But based on what I had, I liked the Yu Kee Yong Tau Foo very much. I have always like this brand and only had it at Bishan outlet and the old food court at Orchard Emerald. So I am very happy it is available here.The items are standard, different from the other yong tau foo stalls, with 5 pieces of tofu and fish ball/fish cake and the noodles are topped with minced meat. I like the set which includes a side of kang kong drizzled with fermented bean curd. So yummy. The soup is also very sweet and tasty.The mee pok stall is also different with fish maw in it. It is not the best bak chor mee but it is decent. Good choice for Orchard Road. The or luak (oyster omelette) was also nice, especially the chili. Skip the Korean ginseng chicken soup which was very bland.Currently there is a 10% discount if you show your passion card."

You will be welcomed by a variety of cuisines and sometimes an overwhelming crowd. I try to come here for lunch around 11am to beat the usual lunch crowd. Queue's are shorter, and more seats to choose from. My favorite is the fish stall where they serve a variety of ways of cooking fish-deep fried and soup. I tried the deep fried dory twice and it was just ok but when I had the soup dish, it's the constant thing that I order every time I'm here. Also, when it comes to beverages, I don't need to come up to the drinks kiosk, I can just wait for auntie to pass by with her cart of refreshing drinks. One time when I was trying to veer away from the usual lime juice that I order, auntie was really helpful in suggesting other drinks and I opted for the lychee-just to try something new.When you come here, and it happens to be crowded, remember to look for more seats through those corridors and not just settle on the seats you see.

The folks from the Breadtalk Group really know how to make a difference with their food courts - which gives them such an edge above the rest. Each food court has a theme - though most of it relates to our Singaporean heritage, there are some subtle differences. For the most famous Food Republic (and probably with the most expensive rent) it is all back to basics of our Singaporean food roots with the revamp this time round and they have decorated it with all types of vintage items from our past which gives it a really nostalgic flavour and makes it distinctly Singaporean, even if some of the stalls in there hail from different countries and serve other cuisines. It is after all our heritage to have a mishmash of everything. There is a total of 23 stalls, 3 mini restaurants and 1 kiosk. How's that for spoilt for choice? I need to eat at this food court whenever I am in town next time and not bother thinking about restaurants.I would recommend that you make a beeline for their Odeon Beef Noodles - where my favorite is the dry noodles that comes with soup that packs a punch. Otherwise there is always the safe choice of Thye Hong Hokkien noodles which made this branch famous in the first place when it first opened. People are still queuing to this date, which is good. Their Indonesian Padang stall also has rather hefty meals that is sure to fill up a hungry person or 10."

The ingredients are fresh, a little cold, but it enhances the experience (Cold Rojak... now that's an idea!).

The Taiwanese one - Forgot the name, but their claim to fame is beef noodle soups using thick noodles cut by hand.  Supposedly the method of cutting imparts superior texture to give a nice, chewy noodle.  We ordered both the beef dumplings and steamed pork dumplings from this place and they were both fresh and tasty.2. There was one stall that made Laksa (traditional noodle in soup) and Laksa Goreng (noodles only). I liked how they offered you the choice of noodle to use.  Laksa had the usual thin fish slices, shrimp, and some sort of shellfish (cockles perhaps?).  Flavors were bold and intense at the same time.3. Soup Guru(?) - My wife liked this one and went here a few times for traditional Chinese soups.  I liked how they described each soup in English and the traditional health benefits of each.4. They had an Indian restaurant (specializing in Biryani) next to an Indonesian restaurant (with their own special chicken set).  I tried the Chicken Biryani this time and its quite good. They gave a whole small bird with skin and all and a good side of rice and some pickled veggies, all plated on a banana leaf. The ""Biryani sauce"" was given as a side.  Overall it was good - a little different than Biryani I've had here in the USA, but still good.5. Sergeant Chicken - they offered both steam and roasted Hainanese Chicken Rice here for just $4 SGD. I opted for the steamed version and was glad I did.  I never knew that such as a simple dish could have so much flavor.  The rice itself was seasoned with broth and you can always add more with the side of soup they gave you.  The chicken can be eaten with the minced ginger or with the spicy chili oil.6. The fruit juice place is pretty decent too.  They charge slightly more if you decline ice in the drinks.  Coconut juice is actually a whole baby coconut with a good amount of juice and coconut meat to chew on.  The mango and guava(?) are also good with the right amout of tart to help sooth a spicy meal.  I think one of the ladies working here also preloads a bunch of the drinks onto a cart and sells them by bringing the drinks throughout the court - which is really efficient.Our least favorite stall is probably the Fish Porridge one on the corner.  My wife expected a nice smooth congee but instead got this clear soup with cooked rice and fish meat mixed in."

Pasta is pretty tasty with mussels and prawns paired with tomato sauce.Seafood Marinara - $13.90Adding $4.90 to my pasta for set of additional soup of the day and 1 soft drinks. I had the Cream of Brocoli with garlic bread by the side of the double layer bowl. The soup was not quite hot, however still able to warm up the tummy.The environment did leave a good impression.

Also insist in sitting inside even if they tell you they are fully booked and you have to sit outside. was told the reservation would be in an hour but my Gf and I finished our meal in 20mins. yet when a party of 6 walked in just like us, they managed to get seats inside on the ""reserved""  tables. disappointed that they are so inconsistent on thisWould come back again as it's one of the better options in the Tanjong Pagar/Outram Park food places."

I saw many good reviews about the seafood marinara so I wanted to try it out , I thought it would be normal to the others but wow , when I tried , one word ; AWESOME ! I just love the flavor of the rich tomato base . And is worth it cuz they give the portion just nice for you . And the pasta is just too QQ and soft . The prawns is cooked perfectly . But I don't quite like the ice lemon tea , cuz when I tasted , is like its comes from the normal can . I thought it would be homemade . But overall 10/10 !

It was crispy and quite flaky.The chicken mulligatawny soup was both sour and salty. I'm not sure how to describe it but it had a pleasant taste. Then was Bharwan aatish khumbh - tandoori Mushrooms with nuts and cheese. It had a wonderful mix of flavours and a rich nutty taste. It was a bit sweet - which the manager had informed us about when we ordered. So it's not for everyone.We also had the murgh korma - chicken in a slightly sweet, mild rose cashew sauce. I was surprised by how mild it was. It seemingly had no chilli, and just a bit of pepper. I could even taste the rose. It was very pleasant and more subtle than Indian food usually is (though it'll probably be derided by purists). One thing to note is that a good cut of chicken was used, whereas lower end Indian places use cheaper cuts. This isn't necessarily a good thing, since the meat loses some moistness and flavour.To accompany our dishes we had butter roti and lachhna paratha (layered paratha). They were pretty good but they were not hot and the former did not have any palpable liquefied butter. In short, they were a bit old. I told the manager who claimed all the food was made only upon ordering. Well...We also had mango lassi which was excellent with a very intense mango taste.The service was not so good unfortunately. I asked for water and the server forgot. Only when I told the manager did it come. The mushrooms also only came upon my reminding the staff.

I highly recommend the lamb chops masala. Dishes are served with rich, velvety sauces. I suspect a lot of ghee goes into these offerings. As a result, the wife and I usually choose to walk home from Curry Culture to battle the inevitable food coma."

After reading lots of great reviews about this place, we decided to dine here on a Friday night. Getting reservation was easy as we were here an hour before it's closing time. We were seated promptly outside and the server was quick enough to take our orders. We had samosa and papdi chaat as our appetizers. The papdi chaat was better of the two.. very tasty with right amount of tanginess, spices and chilly! The samosa was also good but I enjoyed the chaat more. I often judge an Indian restaurant by the kind of chaats they make. I was in the mood of having some cocktail which will be spicy yet having the good liquor .. the waiter knew perfectly my want and served me the India summer- cocktail with whiskey and spices.. it was the perfect drink I needed on a Friday night. A must try drink if you enjoy some spices! The main course- aloo paratha, Channa masala, tandoori roti and aloo gobi was spot on.. very tasty, flavorful and true to its kind. Definitely fabulous dining experience. The service was excellent and a perfect ambience to have dinner with friends. Next time will love to try non- veg dishes as they seem to be excellent!"

I could drink it all the time, except for the fact that it's so hot here, and that the pub is outdoors, with very little cooling.  They also carry some nice craft beers from the world including some of my faves (Rogue, La Trappe, etc) as well as sake, whiskey and shochu.  JiBiru also specializes in yakitori, and the chicken skewer I had was very tasty - perfectly cooked chicken with just the right amount of char and with a sauce that wasn't overly salty or sweet.   The one thing that could improve here is the service though.  With the number of people working here, I found the service to be strangely inattentive or rather focused on one table only  Maybe they were celebs?  No idea, but in any case, JiBiru is a great place to see what Japanese craft breweries are doing these days with some tasty food to boot."

I was pretty disappointed with there Japanese craft beers. I had a sampler of 4 out of 5 different types, I didn't care for any of them. I then tried a Mocha Amaretto beer they had in a bottle, took about 3 sips then bought a different beverage. The last drink I tried was a mango Apple cider which was actually really refreshing being that it is only outdoor seating in Singapore weather. I tried the smoked duck breast(really bland), the Mochi cheese age( not bad when paired with duck breast), and the Curry croquettes. The curry croquettes are to die for, definitely would recommend them with the cider. All else I wound pass on."

Some of these beers cannot even be found in the Japanese supermarkets around! One of our favorites is the chocolate bottled beer, but it comes in only seasonally. It has a really nice packaging, like what you expect to get on a Japanese beer. This little bar started along with the starting of the mall, and has since updated its menu with a good amount of food items, and expanded the choice of imported beer. This I think is a really good sign for any business, having business owners are willing to progress and make changes for the consumers. I guess they have figured out that Singaporeans still like to munch while drinking. However on the downside, the staff are not very attentive. They will not attend to you until you go and take a seat yourself, from several of my personal experiences. Perhaps it is their style of service, but I cannot really get used to it. Environment wise, I actually like the open atmosphere. That's when I can do my favorite activity - people watching! Perfect spot to chill and watch people as they walk along."

I had tried similar elsewhere but there is no comparison. 2) Baked Honey BBQ Pork Pastry - This pastry was another item here that was the best compared to many other establishments which offered the same. The crust was buttery and flaky in a good way. I only despise flaky when it is associated to humans. The filling was generous with savory honey BBQ pork. 3) Char Siew Bun or Stream BBQ Pork Bun - The buns were so fluffy :9 The fillings which were honey BBQ pork were savory and so good.4) Steam Cheong-Fun with Honey BBQ Pork fillings - Rice flour rolls which were thin and soft. This is how it should be. It was light, healthy and tasted good.5) Deep-Fried Prawn Dumplings with Salad Cream- Generous and fresh prawn fillings in every of the dumplings. The dumplings' skins were so thin and crispy ;D  AMBIENCE 5/5No tacky décor but elegant beautiful surrounding. Comfy plushy chairs, nice table settings and lots of seatings. SERVICE 5/5Jorrine the hostess at the door had been working here for years. I recognized her. Always friendly and hospitable. She led me to one of the room inside. The server Shaun took very good care of me the moment I sat down. He was very pleasant, well-mannered and attentive. Taste Paradise has never let me down.

This is truly a well deserving 5 stars establishment in Singapore and ranked the top among all the 5 stars restaurants I rated."

Ordered three items: baked bbq pork bun, soup dumplings, and shark fin soup. I liked the pork bun and soup dumplings. The pork bun dough was crisp on the outside and the meat inside had a lot of flavour. The wrapper is thin and strong that holds the soup and meat well, that's how you know it's good wrapper. It was my first time eating shark fin soup. The soup was light and there's a huge dumpling that holds all the meat. The shark fins all dispersed when I opened the dumpling. All in all, it was a good experience."

Opted for the Peking Duck, Wasabi Prawns, and Foie Gras appetizer which was just heavenly! Peking duck was perfectly crispy and the wasabi Prawns was flavored to perfection. The foie gras was decent. Entrees included the salted egg prawns which consisted of a dozen or so juicy and flavorful prawns lightly fried and then dipped in salted egg yolk. Yum!The US beef with Gai Lan was also excellent. ...it was rather odd having US beef in Singapore. ...trust me on this one!Next came the Kurobata Pork with mushrooms which was also heavenly! Super tender pork in a world class gravy. Ended off the meal with Lobster with XO sauce noodles and their famous mango pomelo sago. Lobster was delicious and their XO sauce was on point.

If I would have to classify it, this is a fine dining Chinese restaurant. Extensive, but well appointed decor throughout, clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant. Very comfortable sitting, nice tablecloth - all sets you in a mood. To prove that this is a fine dining restaurant, it offers a great wine selection, which includes practically all first growth Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Mouton Rothschild, ...), as well as Petrus, Massetto, DRC and if I was not mistaken, even a cult California Screaming Eagle. We had 2011 Rauzan-Sègla with our dinner, and the wine was outstanding after 20 minutes in the glass. Excellent service, starting with wine and food pairing recommendations. Considering our choice of wine, we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of Peking duck, as crispy duck is less sweet - and the recommendation was spot on, excellent pairing - also the duck was cooked perfectly. We also had tofu and green beans, each dish is excellent on its own. One of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce. We also had the dessert - fresh mango purée with an ice cream, which is also beautifully presented on top of cold steaming bowl - another high point of the dinner experience.Once again, excellent service - prompt, attentive, helpful and friendly. Definitely recommended."

Because I can definitely get used to this.First, let's start with their impeccable service. The servers here are polite, friendly and actively try to engage in conversation. They see you as an actual person rather than just another customer, constantly checking in to make sure everything is up to standards.Their interior is very similar to hotel restaurants you find in mainland China, with revolving round tables and private VIP rooms. Their food might come out a bit slow, but it's worth it given the fantastic quality. The shark fin soup is best I've had anywhere. Clear, crisp broth with subdued flavoring that enhances the shark fin rather than overpowering it (which is something I've experienced on numerous occasion in the past). The spring roll that comes with it also adds another element in the texture department, with the flaky, crispy shell playing foil to the soft fins. Their garlic fried and boiled lobster was also delicious, offering two interesting takes on the classic lobster dish. The fried pieces weren't overly greasy, and had enough meat to counterbalance the shell. The boiled meats, however, were the real creme de la creme. Served in a butter garlic sauce, each tender piece of meat melted the moment it entered your mouth, delivering an explosion of flavor. Among the other dishes, I thought their Peking duck was cooked perfectly, though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking. Their braised pork cubes and steak bits were also pretty good, though a bit on the fatty side. In terms of drinks, there was nothing too standout, so I'd recommend just sticking to Tiger. All in all, a fantastic dining experience at one of my favorite places in Singapore."

They still serve dim sum at that time. Yay!We ordered the usual char siew so, which is extremely delicate and crispy! It is a must order dish here. Next, came the XO carrot cake, which I heard so much about. It tastes good and the carrot cake is chunky. I think another place which may be better than here or on par is at Chinatown's Spring Court. I honestly, couldn't be bothered with taking photos subsequently cuz the food was just too delicieus to ignore. We had the braised foie gras in blueberry reduction! It is super yummy!!! I would say it is basically foie gras terrine with blueberry jam! Crackling pork belly could be one of the best served in Singapore. I could have a whole plate to myself.

Crispy and crunchy skin with tender flesh and a sliver of fat, not too much, just enough to be justifiable for those counting calories.Whilst most rave about dim sum here (best dish in my humble opnion is mango prawn, not quite the traditional favourite, but the best one for me), I thought their usual fare was more impressive. Winter melon soup was served steaming hot in a hollowed out winter melon, a little corny but may be the reason it tasted better than others. Cod was very well cooked and it made my day that my mango sago came with a trailing smokey stream of dry ice; for only $4.50, I was getting all the fireworks.The restaurant is lavishly decorated, typical of chinese opulence but with just a touch of modernity. It may annoy you that the wait staff continuously stress that you can only stay for 45min/1hr/1.5hr before you have to vacate your table, but service is prompt and attentive, and the quality of food easily makes up for everything else."

They do at least two seatings at lunch.The Carrot Cake is excellent. A re-interpretation of a hawker favourite. And well interpreted, I think. The addition of succulent bean sprouts is so welcome.The roast pork (siew yoke) was recommended to us. It comes in a slab that has been cut down to look like it came out of a factory. It was okay, but for me, nothing remarkable in the way it was done.The roast duck was good, if you like a roast duck that is trying to be a chicken. ie a little too juicy. I prefer duck that is like duck - allowed to be a little drier. But that's just a personal thing. It is very high quality, with crisp skin.Between two roasts, take the duck.There's some mango dim sum thing, fried and with too much mayo. To me, unless you are a huge mayo fan, it was cloying and just too mayo-ey. Why did Singapore ever think mayo and mango is a good combination? Or mayo and prawn? Ugh!There's also a laksa bean curd dim sum dish. It was all right.Chee Cheong Fun also okay.I like that there's an attempt at incorporating local dishes/flavours rather than just offering standard Cantonese dim sum.It's a pity that during the day time the curtains are drawn and you can't see outside. So it feels like it's night time at Ion. And some of the placement of tables is quite awkward."

The spare ribs in sweet sauce is the first dish that comes to mind - caramelised sauce hangs off succulent tender meat that you won't be able to get enough of. The tasty crackling skin of the peking duck wrapped in thin popiah sheets is also probably one of the best I've ever tasted in Singapore. Another must-try would be the perfectly baked cod that simply melts in your mouth.

Food : M and I are fans of the salted egg yolk custard bun! Taste Paradise offers one of the best salted egg yolk buns in Singapore ... my only gripe is that they only offer the steamed version and not the deep fried mantou version at Man Fu Yuan. Their har gau (shrimp dumplings) and siew mai (pork dumplings) are very fresh and well executed. May, the manager of Taste Paradise informs us that they are made fresh every morning. I really liked the prawn mango roll which is encased in a lightly crumbed roll instead of beancurd skin. Mayonnaise is also thoughtfully included in the roll, so it all oozes out nicely in one moreish bite. The char siew sou (puffs) are really quite awesome, good meat to pastry ratio and the latter is light, buttery and flaky. The carrot cake with XO sauce is not bad but I prefer the one at Space @ My Humble House. The steamed beancurd skin with bacon rolls are pretty awesome as well but the wu kok (deep fried yam puffs) don't taste as good as they look. The double boiled soups are also excellent ... very tasty and great for a cold day. The dessert of aloe vera with ice jelly and wolf berries is extremely refreshing too.Ambience : I like how they have private rooms so one can request for them if one chooses not to be caught up in the hustle and bustle in the main dining hall. The layout is a bit labyrinth-like but nice modern Chinese decor with pictures of the different emperors from various dynasties in the private rooms. Service : Prompt, polite and overall perfect. May runs a tight ship and trains her staff well.Will be back for dinner soon!"

In terms of what they offer, it is a blend of dim sum and various Asian Fusion dishes. How this restaurant works is that you wait to be seated, they give you the menu, and then you check off what you want on the smaller paper menu that is sitting at each table. The main menu has a lot of photos so if you're not quite sure what you want to eat it's pretty easy to get a clearer perspective of what that may be.This restaurant can get very crowded, so don't expect the staff to be highly aware of your presence and cater to all of your needs. Meaning, you really have to ask them to come over if you want to get any service. Though, once they get there, they are fairly efficient in doing their job. In terms of interior design, there are numerous tables throughout this restaurant. Many of them are situated very close to one another. Personally, I like a little space when I eat so I can enjoy my meal and my conversation with the person I am dining with. But, due to the fact that Masa's tables are fairly close to one another, you may have somebody sitting elbow-to-elbow with you, depending on where they actually seat you. Just keep this in mind, because this may not be the atmosphere you wish to dine in.Overall, the food here is pretty good and it is an easy place to get to and grab a quick meal."

I visited this location back in March 2017.I love how this was a simple, fast, breakfast place that serves a hearty food. My mom and I ordered and our meal showed up maybe 5 minutes later. I got pre-set menus that came with Kaya toast and a soft boiled egg. Fishball noodle soup. Yum!This place is where locals grab a quick bite to eat before they move on with their day. It's seat yourself but could also end up sharing tables. It's semi outdoor seating so if you're into A/C, this might not be the location for you. I think tissues are 30 cents so remember to bring your own. After you're done, you can walk off your breakfast through the strip of nicely air conditioned malls!"

Before I texted my sis before to go ahead and order first. A bespectacled server came to me, demanded rudely that if I was not planning to eat anything, I must put on a mask. Was she kidding?? Why must she be so rude?? I countered back ""Yea!! I am eating!!"" During Phase 2 after the ""Circuit Breaker"" (aka shelter in place"", everyone in Singapore still needs to wear a mask when they are out and about. People can now dine in restaurants with social distancing procedures in place. Back to that server, why must she used that kind of tone to talk to me, a customer?? Ugh.. again I have to say this.. is it that hard to be polite to paying customers (Reminded me of that rude server at TCC restaurant @ Marina Bay Sands last year) ? Where was her service or manners?? She should simply say this:   ""Hi there! Sorry, if you do not plan to be eating, would you please put on your mask? Thank you for your understanding!""It is NOT that hard!!!!! My sister just asked me to eat whatever she ordered which were already served at the table. I may not kick a big fuss there, I surely not going to let this slide. I would throw hands the next time I visit there. I really wanted to try the soufflé pancake!My mood was ruined but I had to say the seafood pancake was really good! There was also this basket of korean chickens which was not bad either. The ginseng ade was really good!Ambience here is definitely 5 stars. Service was a 0 (the owner should thank their rude staff).

Because of dietary restrictions, I either avoid sandwich shops unless they have a low or no carb option. Although it is not on their menu, Rebel owners Wei Li and Sandy and their team are there to listen to your dietary needs and customize with their products.They listened and surprised me with a huge and delicious bowl packed with vegan and meat proteins, fresh vegetables and avocado. Vegan chicken nuggets are genius. They eerily tasted like chicken in flavor and texture. The tempeh is textuurrific! It has a satisfying bite and chew. I loved eating these with their Nuclear spicy sauce. The omelette perfectly fine cooked, great consistency and taste. I enjoyed their fresh, chunky rich avocado and Vietnamese julienned daikon radish and carrot pickle. This went so went with the chicken patties. The Thai chicken patty had notes that hinted of Thai fishcake. The Vietnamese chicken tastes like the meats in a Banh Mi sandwich. The cilantro brought those flavors together. There are no fillers and icky additives in their patties or other products. They at in the process of getting their restaurant certified halal.I also tried their delicious soups. I had the tomato soup and the mushroom soup. The tomato is good, but the mushroom is divine, the I-CANNOT-STOP-MYSELF divine. They are served with seasoned breadsticks which act as spoons. The reduce the use of disposable silverware. They gave me one because I don't eat bread. Wei Li and Sandy took the time to check on their customers and tell their story.

The portion size for the large is quite generous, and was definitely filling for me. The salmon and salmon belly were both very flavorful and had a nice texture. I wasn't a huge fan of the other fish, but they tasted pretty decent. The ikura was a bit too fishy for me though.- Aburi Kaizen Chirashi Don: This is the same as the Kaizen Chirashi Don, except the fish are all seared a bit. This is more expensive, and I overall felt the regular bowl was better. The searing tastes off a bit too much of the flavor for some of the fish.- Sake Sashimi: 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. Very tasty but was a bit pricey for the portion.Service:No problem with the service, but be prepared to wait if you come at peak times. I came on a weekday and the restaurant was nearly full (with a lot of reserved tables already).Price: $$/$$$The Chirashi Dons were both $26.90, though the normal one was a Large size and the Aburi one was a regular size.

Overall, the service was super quick and food appeared almost instantly.I will join the choir and sing praise for their kaisen chirashi don: it really is as amazing as you read in the reviews (and the reviews of their other location). The fish was amazing, the slices were thick and super fresh. I had trouble finishing the normal size don (granted I had a late and rather big lunch) which is a first!Highly recommended!"

Yes I've heard about this place also having one of the most worth it chirashi sets at a good price. Well... Everyone was right! As seen on Yelp, I went for the popular items right away - the scallop mentaiko carpaccio to share, I had the premium chirashi and my friend being a smaller eater had the normal chirashi. The premium chirashi even came with uni inside with big and plump ikura! Everything was generally very fresh, however the prawn was a bit slimy and strong tasting to be absolutely honest. Everything else was to expectation and a little above, given the great feedback all over the Internet. One thing about this place that really stuck out was their stuff which are aburi-ied (flame torched) ! Anything that they flame torched wasn't just for show. It really does bring out that extra flavour! They seemed like masters at it. Even down to the scallop mentaiko carpaccio! That smokey flavour.... I miss it already!They seem to have a chirashi bowl that is all aburi (torched on one side and raw behind)! I absolutely can't wait to go back and try that! I'm giving this outlet 4.2 out of 5 stars! Would have been slightly higher if it weren't for that lousy prawn! ;)"

Blasphemy, I know!  I find that the food selection here is a lot more extensive than the original. The Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, which in my view, is the STAR dish of this restaurant, is not available at the original location, from what I remember. Second, the Ngee Ann City space is far larger and has much more of a restaurant feel than the hole-in-the-wall experience at the original location. Third, the queue is a tad bit shorter.  In any event, the aburi dishes are the real winners of The Sushi Bar, separateing them from every other sushi restaurant in Singapore. I'm not familiar with the term ""aburi"", but from what I understand, it is essentially grilled/torched raw fish. The Sushi Bar has perfected the art of torching high quality sushi, leaving the edges burnt with the inside nice and raw. Simply, an awesome combination. In short, depending on whether you fancy chirashi or sushi, you should order either the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, Salmon Aburi Roll or both!"

Service, however, is brusque and sullen. The aburi salmon roll they are famous for is flavourful at first bite. The dollops of mayo on top lends it sweetness and creaminess, with a touch of saltiness that accentuates the other flavours. However, once you remove the dollop of mayo on top, the roll itself is extremely average. Though fatty and plump, the salmon itself is not particularly flavourful. The filling of avocado and crab stick and lean maguro don't contribute much in terms of flavour too. So I would say the star of the dish is the mayo! :)  There are better quality sushi options out there at a similar price point."

The gf was craving Chee Cheong Fun and I suddenly thought of this place. Now this is a place that lives up to its name! We went for a standard Char Siew (sweet roasted pork) Cheong fun, a mushroom Cheong Fun, Century Egg And pork porridge and the raw fish. First the raw fish. I love my raw fish. I adore it. I crave for it but this one.... This one disappointed me a little. Not that is wasn't fresh but well;,. Firstly they use a different fish. I believe the regular market/food Centre 鱼生 (raw fish) uses Ikan Parang while this one tasted like snapper fillets. No that I'm complaining about the texture, but what bothered me was the additional Acar. A) I'm not a big fan of Acar to begin with and b) I think the sweetness from the Acar spoils the dish. Gone was that salty, sour (from the lime) 鱼生 dish that I loved. Next came the porridge. What I loved about the porridge here was how thick it was! Unlike the usual ""as-smooth-as-you-can"" style of Cantonese porridge houses, this place likes their porridge chunky and if you're a fan of century egg like we are, you have to do the $1.00 add-on for century eggs. What you'll get in return is a century egg porridge packed with so many pieces that you're guaranteed at least 1 piece egg with every spoon. Next came the 2 Cheong funs. The mushroom Cheong fun was alright. It was a play safe option since we couldn't decide on what to order after the Char Siew. The char Siew on the other hand was really nice. Char Siew wasn't dry and they used a good mix of fat and meat. But what really stood out for both dishes were how soft the Cheong fun itself was! Picking up with chopsticks alone was a challenge and when popped in the mouth, you get this wonderfully light smooth texture that almost melts in your mouth. Definitely one of the best Cheong funs I've had in a while. Overall... This place was worth the short walk in the sun but it could be quite warm if you're lunching there. We'll be back to try their other unique Cheong funs like cheese and lobster and abalone."

I had the boat version since I had no idea what that included and wanted to try something new. Maybe that was my mistake. Nothing special.I do have to admit that the cheung fun was delicious though! The made-to-order rolls were so fresh and tender with a good bite to the rice sheet.  Tried the cha siew and fresh prawn flavors - both good but I enjoyed the latter more.  They had a lot of advertising for their special durian flavored cheung fun but I didn't end up trying it.  I generally like to eat my durian as is and not cooked into anything.Overall an ok place but also a tad more expensive than a usual small shop like this.

The century egg porridge is very average and unremarkable, but I find the chee cheong fun is damn delicious!!

Nope; we're west and north of the target these folks are aiming for. But with a base of good Tex-Mex and some farther south-of-the-border influences, it was just what this culinarily homesick guy needed to restore my faith in civilisation, at least until I get hungry again. That won't be for a while... the portions aren't huge by norteamericano standards, but by Singapore standards generally, they're more than respectable. I was starving when I sat down and decided I really wanted comfort food after all, so I had the beef chimichanga... and could barely finish it. (People who know me, and too many who don't, have heard me complain for years about how stingy most restaurants here are with their portions, unless you're paying four-star-or-higher prices.)Ditto to what others have said about the jalapeños. I haven't had peppers that good in years. Also ditto to what others have said about the service; when we came in in a group of five, the place was at what looked like the end of early-supper rush, and we felt very welcome. Professional, attentive, patient and flexible service very unlike far too many places I've been here the last few years.If you go in expecting authentic Juárez or Tampico-style cooking, you're going to be disappointed. If you think this is going to be a slightly more upscale Chili's with better Tex-Mex, you're close, but in for a (pleasant) surprise. I know I'll be back, and at least 3 of the 4 others in my party (with varying levels of exposure to the cuisine in general) were also enthusiastic.Notice how all the positive reviews are from Americans or Americans-turned-locals and the negative reviews are from born locals (at least as I write this)? If you live here a decade or so, you'll understand; until then, if anybody knows better food for the money, it's news to me."

I will also note that on their site, Viva Mexico claims to be  traditional Mexican food and not Tex-Mex.  While they have some moles, from what I saw of their menu, it is mostly Tex-Mex.  Plus, the fajitas seem to be pretty popular.  They are as Tex-Mex as it gets.My goal was to find a place that served decent US chain (El Toritios, etc..) quality Tex-Mex food.  My mission was a success.  In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is.  This is true from the ambiance to the food.Speaking of the ambiance; it is festive.  Well, it is in the festive get out the decorations for taco night sort of way.  But it sets the mood for having a margarita or two.  And speaking of margarita's theirs are pretty good.  Nothing to write home about, but good enough to keep the Viva Mexico mood going.  It seemed like everyone there was in good spirits and enjoying their meals.  For me, this was a nice plus to the overall ambiance.The staff was friendly, professional, and prompt.  This was maintained throughout our meal.  This even included a moment where the power went out.  But that was only a very minor hiccup.The food was quite good.Nachos - We started with some nachos.  We enjoyed them very much.  I sought out the jalapeños.  My friend did everything she could to eat around them.  The chips were crisp.   The cheese was all melted.  This is all just as it should be.tinyurl.com/bz5eu8nGuacamole - We also ordered a side of guacamole.  This was also very good.  There were lots of fresh ingredients.  They had also insured not to over mix it so there was still some texture.tinyurl.com/aleeo7jFajitas - I ordered chicken.  She ordered beef.  I thought both were good.  I love fajitas.  I love food where you get to do a little bit of combining and playing while eating.  Being her first adventure with fajitas, my friend did not embrace this part as much.  She abandoned the create your own fajita taco and stuck with the fork and knife.  I thought that both the chicken and beef were cooked well.  They were both tender and had nice seasoning.  The veggies were still very crispy.  All in all -  two good sets of fajitas.tinyurl.com/abmcj9qOverall - This was a fun meal.  The food was good.  The service was pleasant.  The ambiance was on the festive side.  Good stuff!  I will be back."

Hell to the no. Is this the best TEXMEX in Singapore? Hell to the YES! I came here on a Friday night with Michelle M. and there was a small band jamming and singing in Spanish! What a perfect way to start our TexMex adventure. We ordered nachos, crab enchiladas, beef burrito, and beef tacos. I didn't try the beef burrito, but the crab enchiladas and beef tacos deserve an ole! The enchilada sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but it definitely tasted like enchilada sauce so me gusta! It didn't taste much different from Chevy's enchiladas, which I faintly recall. Plus, the nice chunks of crab meat gave it a distinctive local flavor. Kind of like chili crab but no need for messy hands or a bowl of lemon water. The tacos are also worth the $17 as the price included 3 soft shelled tacos, rice, refried beans, and a small salad. Not bad considering Lucha Loco charges $11 for just one taco. The refried beans were also delicioso, def. an item I'll order as a side or even as an appetizer. I'm no nacho lover, but Viva Mexico's nachos blew me away. They came with REAL jalapenos! Nice big, fat vinegary ones!   ¡Salud! I was so happy I almost burst into tears...do you know how difficult it is to find jalapenos in Singapore?? My homemade Mexican food just doesn't taste the same without them. Viva Mexico (and Subway, I guess), tell me who your distributor is, por favor! I need them jalapenos! This certainly isn't the best TexMex I've had in my life, but for Singapore, I'm thoroughly impressed. For the price, atmosphere, and food--me encanta!

I will also note that on their site, Viva Mexico claims to be  traditional Mexican food and not Tex-Mex.  While they have some moles, from what I saw of their menu, it is mostly Tex-Mex.  Plus, the fajitas seem to be pretty popular.  They are as Tex-Mex as it gets.My goal was to find a place that served decent US chain (El Toritios, etc..) quality Tex-Mex food.  My mission was a success.  In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is.  This is true from the ambiance to the food.Speaking of the ambiance; it is festive.  Well, it is in the festive get out the decorations for taco night sort of way.  But it sets the mood for having a margarita or two.  And speaking of margarita's theirs are pretty good.  Nothing to write home about, but good enough to keep the Viva Mexico mood going.  It seemed like everyone there was in good spirits and enjoying their meals.  For me, this was a nice plus to the overall ambiance.The staff was friendly, professional, and prompt.  This was maintained throughout our meal.  This even included a moment where the power went out.  But that was only a very minor hiccup.The food was quite good.Nachos - We started with some nachos.  We enjoyed them very much.  I sought out the jalapeños.  My friend did everything she could to eat around them.  The chips were crisp.   The cheese was all melted.  This is all just as it should be.tinyurl.com/bz5eu8nGuacamole - We also ordered a side of guacamole.  This was also very good.  There were lots of fresh ingredients.  They had also insured not to over mix it so there was still some texture.tinyurl.com/aleeo7jFajitas - I ordered chicken.  She ordered beef.  I thought both were good.  I love fajitas.  I love food where you get to do a little bit of combining and playing while eating.  Being her first adventure with fajitas, my friend did not embrace this part as much.  She abandoned the create your own fajita taco and stuck with the fork and knife.  I thought that both the chicken and beef were cooked well.  They were both tender and had nice seasoning.  The veggies were still very crispy.  All in all -  two good sets of fajitas.tinyurl.com/abmcj9qOverall - This was a fun meal.  The food was good.  The service was pleasant.  The ambiance was on the festive side.  Good stuff!  I will be back."

There's everything from Ramen to Sushi, and I think is great for families, because there's always something for everyone. My favorite for sure is AJISAI ramen! This place is quite small, so if you are coming here with 2+ people, I would recommend to first grab a table and then get your food. Another pro tip, is to first get your drinks before ordering the food. All drinks must be purchase from business #1."

Selfish, I know. My love for this joint however, has started to waver a little and in my own twisted way of thinking, I'm hoping if more people patronize the shop because they know about it, they'll tighten up the quality standards and everyone benefits.So why do i like Tsuru-Koshi? It's the only udon specialist restaurant that I know of my side of town (it's sad but true, but that's the crabby restaurant landscape in Singapore). It seems like a classic Japanese restaurant transplant that I imagine had some amount of quality control done by the OCD Japanese owner or his Singaporean equivalent. The noodles have always been cooked on the cusp of al dente and the tempura items fried crisp. Lastly, the prices are decent given where the restaurant is located and the portions for quality.What's wrong now? The restaurant is still by far the only means for me to get remotely Japan-standard udon in Singapore, short of going to one the high end places worthy of a business lunch. This place wouldn't stand out in Japan by any means, but for Singapore, it's great. However, on a visit yesterday, I noticed the cooks have become sloppy. The Asu Asu Tan Tan udon I normally order came in a little mess of a bowl - with the minced meat chucked to one side, the noodles un-artfully dunked in and the soft egg broken. The tempura sides we ordered - pumpkin, ebi and the fish cake tubes - left oily kisses on the tenshi. The latter is a cardinal tempura sin in my book. If I wanted a sloppy fry-up, I'd head to Smith's.So yes, this review is strange in that I am none too pleased about what's happening in the kitchen. But, the udon still beats the competition by far. So do me a favor, stop by and grab a bowl or two regularly and tell them to step it up, please? Or tell me if you know of any worthy alternatives."

I love cold udon in a simple soy sauce with lemon, but this time I opted for the ""hot spicy cold sauce with minced pork"" which was very delicious. My only complaint is that for 9 bucks, I was expecting more noodles. It's a good size for most girls in Singapore I think. And the egg was pretty good.

This is the 2nd K+B location with the first operating for a few months now at Leisure Park Kallang. The owners hope to open many more and franchise it throughout Asia. The pizza are delicious and because I'm a thin-crust fan, this place already has a ""pizza"" my heart. The crust has a little spring & chewiness to it so if you prefer a harder crust, you may not enjoy it as much. The sauce and topping options are very extensive and fresh, but the bacon is superb. Perfect size slices of real side pork, and not that dried baco-bit stuff many other places use.

I think the staff is cordial and efficient. The only difference is they will hand you a hot towel once seated to clean your hands? They also offer aprons and cloth to cover your bags on the chair. As reservations can be made for lunch, we didn't have to wait for a table and make use of their manicure services and fruits refreshment. You are given a tablet to order your food. Somehow ours was set to the Chinese language and unfortunately most of us could not read it and order. Finally a friend who can read it found there was an option to switch to English (upper right corner). They should consider putting ""ENG"" or something when the menu was in Chinese mode and in Chinese characters when in English mode so the monolingual can select the language option. Alternatively you can also flag down a wait staff for assistance. The food is good. Fresh and appetizing and of better quality. I did not expect cod in the seafood platter. The soup is also tasty and the Szechuan spicy soup (mala) is actually drinkable. It did get spicier after a while. Take out the chili to reduce the spice level or ask to top up the soup to dilute the spiciness. The chicken soup is delicious too. I am also surprised the cost is lower than expected. I thought it would be similar to Imperial Treasure Steamboat pricing (about $100+ for 2) but it turned out quite reasonable. Maybe it depends on what we ordered too. For a table of 5 girls, it came to around $140. We had a seafood platter, slice beef, beef balls, mushroom platter and vegetable platter. We did not add the self service free flow seasoning for $4++ each as we did not fancy the desserts or fruits. We were full with what we had, with room for dessert elsewhere.This is a comfortable place for hotpot but it is very crowded and so it is very noisy too. I still prefer to have steamboat at home but I will not mind returning if since reservations can be made. No way will I queue for this though. The usual wait time is about 2 hours or more. Another slightly cheaper option with equally fresh and good food will be Shi Li Fang at Orchard Central and Icon Village."

Many restaurants should take a leaf or two from them to really enhance diners experience. Secondly, their food items are really fresh and appetizing. I would like to specially mention the pork balls. They don't have the porky taste and each bite is QQ and full of flavour! Super win! I usually don't enjoy eating meatballs because so many people kill it for me. Their pork balls is currently my top ranking ones in terms of taste and texture! We chose the herbal black chicken soup base and their signature mala spicy soup base. I requested for really low level of spice as I don't know what to expect. Turned out it still packed quite a punch though it's low spice level. Their chicken soup is white and full of flavour. Even without anything in it, I could have drank bowls and bowls of it already! And to give them credit for using REAL stock, I didn't feel thirsty even after me drinking a lot of soup by the end of the meal. Dessert and condiments counter, we opted for this at an additional $4 per pax but to me, it's really worth it. Not only I can mix my own dipping sauce the way I like it, there is a nice selection of fruits and Chinese desserts. Today, they had rock melon and watermelon which were nice and sweet. As for the Chinese desserts, I enjoyed their chilled Beancurd and white fungus especially. All in all an excellent meal! Totally satisfied and already planning when to return again. Surely a sign of an excellent restaurant!"

Amazed that the waiting time can stretch up to 2-3 hours! But they try to make it less painful by offering free food, drinks, even manicures if you choose to wait. Instead we went window shopping and came back when we anticipated the table might be ready. We still had to wait about 20 mins despite being told our number was next in line. Can kill time by folding paper cranes to redeem a $6 dish haha. After being shown to our seats, we were offered a ziplock bag for our phones, aprons to cover our clothes etc. Thoughtful indeed. Ordered the ingredients we wanted over an ipad, and half portions were available. Our waitress helped us concoct a dipping sauce and also helped cooked some of the ingredients. I even saw her peeling prawns for the next table. Hot towels are also given for us to freshen up. Service indeed is one of the commendable highlights here. So now let's talk about the food. The tomato broth is indeed one of the yummiest soups they have offered. A slight sweetness that goes well with most of the ingredients. Also had the Szechuan mala one which I sometimes mixed with the tomato soup in my own bowl for that wonderful pairing. Appreciated the fresh seafood pastes (prawn, squid etc) and meat balls. At least the more premium pricing is justified by the fresh, non-processed ingredients. Also was treated to live noodle making show. After the yummy steamboat, there are still fresh fruits, sweet chinese tong sui and ice cream if you must have something sweet to end the meal. Pricing was about $50/pax which is a bit high for us tourists, but I think you pay what you get and this is a place definitely worth trying at least once! Go for the 4 soup option then haha. The only thing making me think twice is the waiting time.... but I did hear that they open until 3 or 5 am.... so supper option maybe?"

Everyone knows the service here is top-notch (hot towels, popcorn & herbal tea & fruits & manicures while you wait, ziploc bags for phones, aprons, hairties, etc), but I wouldn't come here if not for the amazing amazing food. For steamboat the broth is paramount and basically defines your meal. And the broth here has been consistently good. I always order the ma la with either the mushroom (they call it San Xian) or black chicken soup. No steamboat restaurant has the same reverence for and focus on the soup: it's served to drink alone with parsley and spring onion before you even add any ingredients, and on its own, it's already so addictive. It comes with ingredients too - actual black chicken, and two types of mushrooms & fishballs for the mushroom one. I am a huge fan of ma la tang, and the one here is tasty in itself, even after I scoop out most of the chili oil. It's actually drinkable !!!The dishes here are also fresh and inventive. You can order half or full portions - we usually order half portions and add on later if we like the dish. My faves: -Noodles - freshly spun and cut at your table. A rather small portion though, so order more if you'd like to enjoy more of this silky soft handmade la mian. -Pork and chives dumplings - YUM. Too many steamboat places are sloppy on their dumplings. The filling is fresh and juicy, while the skin tastes just like mee hoon kueh / like the la mian. Delicious. -Fish glue - my family loves this. It tastes very distinctly of fresh prawn here, compared to other places where it may taste more like fish or fish cake. -Meats like U.S. beef and black pork - thinly sliced and delicious on its own, even cooked in lighter soups like chicken/mushroom soup. The portions are not that large though, so savor them! -Meatballs - none of that tasteless frozen synthetic junk here. Tastes just like fresh meat. I'm also addicted to their chilled beancurd, served along with their sauces and condiments ($4 each). I'd usually balk at paying for this at some other steamboat restaurants but never hesitate at Hai Di Lao: besides the chilled beancurd (which is impossibly fine and soft and light and delicious and I eat maybe 5 portions each time), there're a few traditional cold dishes like peanuts and beancurd skin, fresh and actually very ripe fruits like watermelon and cut oranges, and a ridiculous display of sauces. Tbh I don't know why someone would have Korean gochujang or fermented beancurd sauce with steamboat...but definitely impressive variety. I feel like I need to say something bad about Hai Di Lao after raving for so long...so let me rack my head. Okay, it was a bit of a pain to make reservations because the line is often busy and can't get through. But just keep calling and make them, because you don't want to watch hungrily outside for 2 hours. I've never waited. This usually means I make reservations a few days or a week ahead. Of course Hai Di Lao is pricier than the usual run-of-the-mill steamboat restaurant. Orders of two types of broth already totals to more than $20 for the table. But it's not meant to compete with more casual places - Hai Di Lao offers a relaxed, quieter, more formal ambiance, where you can leisurely cook and sip at your soup and chat while enjoying your meal. IMO that's worth paying for occasionally, and frequently if you can afford it!"

They are pretty known for their service and quality of food. The service staff is generally very courteous and attentive. The usual practice is that after the soup boils, the service staff will offer to pour out some soup and add some gsrnishing for you before you actually cook your food. If you have trouble with the menu they will be more than willing to help you out. Also when you do order prawns, they will check if you'd like them to remove the shells for you and if you would like to have the prawn heads in the soup. I would say that the 313 branch is slightly less crowded and easier to get a table. They now have a new concept of small individual pot as an alternative to having one big pot with 2 separate soups. Price wise, it's slightly higher as they do provide more than just food, free manicure session for the ladies if you have to wait very long for a table and a kids playing area."

Portions are a little on the smaller side, but I'm told the noodles are in a bigger bowl now than a year ago. Wontons are still small, but the portion of brisket and tendon is fairly generous.

The noodle is excellent: very thin and elastic just like in Hong Kong. The deal-breaker for me was its broth which had an excruciatingly pungent aftertaste not dissimilar to foul ammonia smell (i can't remember if it was this bad in Hong Kong). This likely came from lye water used to make the noodles but the odd thing is the noodles tasted perfectly fine until i drank the soup which ruined the dish in one sip. I guess that's the price of admission for springy noodles.Shrimp dumplings, consisting of 1 slice of shrimp and some wood-ear mushrooms loosely packed together in wonton skin, were unimpressive. The bite does not offer sufficient flavor contrast and seemed to be missing a binder and thus fell apart easily upon consumption."

I forgot how the noodle was served in a regular rice bowl. I had the beef brisket with shrimp wanton noodle so the bowl was just slightly bigger. I felt the portion was small but I was not sure if it was because I was used to the bigger bowls served in Crystal Jade and Imperial Treasure. I would say the portion filled me up to 75% full so it was probably good if one wants to eat less or practice eating to 80% fullness. There were 4 wantons which was decent as some places would only give 2-3 wantons when you ordered a mix. The beef brisket could be more tender but it was not bad. The noodles were thin and chewy (Hong Kong style) and the soup was a tad too salty for me. The chili was strange, I would prefer the type served at Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure. I guessed the people has spoken. The noodle did not live up to its hype so there was no queue after 3 months of opening. It was still only half filled close to 12pm."

Broth was tasty, and noodles were well cooked and springy, but had a very strong lye water flavour that I dislike.

Unlike what my mother had commented, the portion was pretty reasonable (not too small). The noodles were stringy and on the side there was oyster sauce that you suppose to stir together with the noodles to increase the flavors. I tried the noodle first. Unlike another store I tried this week, it was pretty well cooked. It wasn't too soft or too hard to chew. The prawn wontons together with the soup were flavorful. Not as salty as I thought it might be.The Luo Han Guo drink was refreshing but I would probably try the other drinks the next time round.

I have to be honest here. I haven't been to Hong Kong in the last 20 years so it's very difficult for me to asses Mak's Noodles authenticity versus their Hong Kong counterpart.What I will do however, is compare it to other wanton noodles found in Singapore, based on either similar style or price range (so yes, no comparing to auntie lim or auntie choo's wanton Mee at xxx Coffee shop). Tossed Noodle with Shrimp Roe and Oyster Sauce. One of their signature dishes here, I found it leaning to the slightly saltier side. While the noodle was beautifully springy or ""Q Q"", the shrimp roe did end up making the dish a tad bit too smart for my liking. Braised Beef Tendon and Brisket Noodle Now this was a dish that I liked... A LOT!While still leaning slightly towards the salty side, the sauce added a great additional depth to the noodles. Coating the noodles with a smooth, rich and really beefy sauce (be warned, it is really really beefy), served with a fairly generous portion of brisket and tendon, this dish will make any meat lover happy! Wanton soupHow could we come to Mak's and not try their signature wantons. First impressions? A generously stuffed wanton!Nothing can be worse than a wonton with really thick skin and minimum ingredients and this wanton is not one of them. Smooth skinned with a really juicy filling, the wanton was a delight to have! Overall..... A very decent wanton restaurant. The noodles are a lot finer to what most people are used to and because of its springiness, might irritate diners by getting caught between the teeth (I should know, I got a few stuck throughout my lunch), but, however, it was still a good Plate of wanton noodles. Queues are managed well and staff are generally friendly. That said.... Is it a Michelin star restaurant? Hmmm maybe the Hong Kong one but certainly not the ones in Singapore and, it is slightly on the higher end of the spectrum when compared to competitors like crystal jade etc, but it's still generally a decent bowl of wanton Mee."

We especially LOVE hotpot BUT the broth here is on another level. We used to go to other location which is in Katong, too, but the broth quality there had gone down the drain. So.. this is the most consistent location we know. And by consistent, I mean that the soup is always of the same quality (never diluted) when it's served (before you added the extra ones from the bottles, of course).The most common broths that people get are the Ma La and Collagen. I personally love the collagen one so much and recommend everyone to order at least that one when they first come to visit. For the Ma La, it's really hot and this place definitely does the kick. There's also a large selection of ingredients to create your own sauces that you can mix n match to dip in your items. My friends usually mix some of the ingredients together for their tangy, spicy or garlicky sauces. In addition, they also provide fruits to end your meal. Some of the drinks are refillable and my favorite is the sweet & sour one.After you finish your meal, they tend to give you a small cup of sweetness to wash down your meal with as (or before) you pay along with free wet tissues. No spoilers, but this is a place to constantly experience especially on a cold day with your loved one; that's my bowl of happiness.On a side note, bookings are required especially on the weekend and there's always 20% OFF from 10:30pm onwards everyday."

Well it is mostly known to the office workers and retail shops people working nearby. So it is hidden only to the tourists and general shoppers in Orchard Road.Most people will flock to the food courts in Orchard Road (not much choices with Food Republic dominating most malls and the ever crowded one at Takashimaya) for cheaper eats. Some may head to Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza for the smaller local food outlets. Then you get this place.It is a staff canteen for Singtel employees working there but somehow it has open its doors to outsiders. It is a Godsend as the food prices are way cheaper than the places named previously. I only learned of its existence after my colleagues brought me there when I started working in the Orchard area. Apparently many construction workers and retail shop staff usually buy the food here as the portion is bigger at the cai fan stall and is relatively cheaper. There are two prices displayed for staff and non-staff. Generally you can get a full meal including a drink for $5 or less. The food is not the best but it is pretty decent.For cheap eats in the premium shopping belt, I'm in!"

The duck leg is cured overnight, slowly simmered for another 10 hours before pan-frying to yield a golden-brown crispy skin, encasing the tender and flavorful meat. Paired with braised red cabbage and sautéed potatoes.Nothing beats a whole pork knuckle to go along with some beer! Eisbein, a traditional German delicacy, features a whole pork knuckle marinated overnight with a special in-house blend, boiled for another hour and then glazed with a coat of apple vinegar to attain a crisp finish. Good for sharing!Have some Asian comfort food with the Dolsot Bibimbap. Mix in the homemade gochujang, a fermented condiment specially concocted by Korean Chef Kim, for a sweet, tangy and subtle chilli kick.The Taste of the World ala carte menu is available daily for both lunch and dinner at The Dining Room.

Very FEW choices, and Very BASIC make...DRINK ORDER offers, on the other hand were constant, and the alcoholic ones came fast.. Real problem with non-alcoholic drinks was that they had no idea what a Lemon, Lime & Bitters was.. Nor a Lime Soda..? We found this a little far-fetched...

Some highlights of the buffet includes an entire ice bar with seafood such as oysters, mussels, shrimps and crayfish. There's also various live stations manned by chefs who'll cut up sashimi, duck and cook pasta for you. The selection of hot food has dishes that ranges from Chinese, Indian, to Mediterranean. Since we went during the CNY period, besides the usual fresh vegetable for your pick of salad mixture, they also had ingredients for the traditional Lo Hei so you can make your own to do your little mixture and enjoy it with your friends/family for a more prosperous year ahead!The dessert bar is also really awesome with a good selection of cakes, tarts, pies and of course, dont forget to ask the chef for a chocolate lava cake! Waiting time is about 5mins so go make your order first, pick up some fruits and marshmallows to dip into the chocolate fondue then go back to collect your cake. To make the lava cake even better, you can add a scoop of ice cream or preserved fruits, whichever suits your palette more! Not into lava cake, you can also ask for a waffle instead.All in all, a really good experience. Yums and cheers to a great year to come!"

I thought the food was pretty yummy and fairly cheap.Be warned though, this place is somewhat similar to a Korean BBQ place in that you may end up coming out smelling of BBQ! Delicious, but perhaps not the best sort of perfume.. Anyway, here on a Sunday afternoon, fairly crowded, seemed to be quite populated with Filipinos. Service was fairly quick - although we did have to wait a little bit for our waters to get refilled.Grilled squid aka Inihaw na Pusit ($14.95) was delicious! Nice sauce and good char-grill taste. Not too chewy, nice bite to it. A bit too charred at some places - we were trying to scrape a bit off (avoid carcinogens.. plus completely burnt bits don't make for the nicest taste either).Bulanglang ($7.45) was pretty good too, hadn't had it before so it was definitely interesting. Mixed vegetables in a rather salty sauce (as long as you don't try to drink the sauce on its own you're fine - just be satisfied with it flavouring/clinging on to the veges!) I liked the eggplant, had a good roasted taste. Other veges include bittergourd (not a fan in general), pumpkin (ok, not that sweet), okra, long beans, some tomato/onion (yum!). Also, four pieces of grilled fish on top had pretty good flavour too!Garlic rice ($1.70) was nice, soft and flavourful; I bet a good amount of oil went in to making it moist/yummy. Haha. Oh well...Pinaputok na cream dory ($11.95) was also delicious! I thought 'cream dory' meant it was going to be creamy so I was a bit wary, but boy was I wrong. This dish came wrapped in a banana leaf (I love foods that are steamed/wrapped in leaves! They are usually scrumptious) and tasted pretty healthy (surprisingly, Filipino food isn't really something I associate with healthy living haha). Steamed veges (tomato/onion/leeks) with tender fish, mmm. Glad my dad picked it!"

Like most restaurants on the Cuppage Terrace, this place is tiny, there is plenty of seating outside but the restaurant itself is small. The food and the flavors are there. I tried the yellow curry and my colleague tried the spicy noodles. The yellow curry was not overpowering, very light, and very authentic. The other dish was spicy and hot yet he couldn't stop eating them it was that good. With such good we had to try the dessert, I wish I remembered the name of clicked a picture. It was the first one on the menu and looks like a sundae except much tastier with coconut milk, brown sugar on the side and green gummies. Again, I am not much of a dessert person, but I couldn't stop myself from finishing. We complimented the owner and chatted with him after dinner. Great conversation. Now to the not so good side of the restaurant. I hate to do this but has to be done. The service is poor. My companion was visually uncomfortable, and we asked for the water several times and the sweet sauce. Yet it took a solid 10 minutes with only one more table occupied in the restaurant. There is no tap water, and the place is expensive about $50+/person. At those prices, I would expect good service and least of all free water.

We chose Thai because we didn't feel like eating much and figured some Tom Yum would work. Service was spot on, but the soup we ordered medium spicy had fire coming out of our ears. It was replaced promptly, and the new ""mild"" version was hotter than the medium we're used to, but acceptable. The broth was tasty, but the high price wasn't justified by the paucity of solid food. Mine was shrimp, and there were just four of those puppies. My husband's chicken was hard to find. Two bowls of soup and nothing else came close to $40 with all the taxes/service charges. It's easy to find cheap food in Singapore, but you gotta stick to street food if you're on any kind of budget. Ginger Thai was okay, but not worth the money."

Food continues to be very special. Very very good. They were short handed this night with a full house. No one was flustered. Only 2 servers. Chef Denis even had to help with service. Nonetheless service was good. A little slow but why rush when you can take your time to savor the meal. This restaurant remains highly recommended. You will not be disappointed food and service wise.

I've been itching to try Singapore's infamous Kaya Toast and luckily, Toast Box was only a few minutes away from my hotel. Not to mention, it was opened bright and early, which was perfect for the jet lagged me. Toast Box is situated at the basement of The Centrepoint and one of the earliest places opened for business in the building. When I got to Toast Box with my boyfriend, there were already a few customers enjoying their breakfast and one person ahead of us. When it was our turn, we told the lady what we wanted but she asked us questions in Mandarin. Unfortunately, our Mandarin is pretty crappy but we used context clues. LOL. My boyfriend saw noodles on the menu so he tried to order that but it wasn't available. Not sure if it's not a breakfast thing or just no longer on the menu. So he got the cheese toast (came with ham and egg on top) while I got the Kaya toast. The lady asked us what drinks we would like with our meals and what type of eggs we wanted with the Kaya Toast. We went with honey tea, milk tea, and soft boiled eggs (came with 2 eggs). The seating area is small but there's more seats and tables outside of the enclosed space! The drinks, Kaya toast, and eggs were ready under 5 minutes. But the cheese w/ ham & egg toast took awhile. Understandable as there was only one lady managing the cash register and one man cooking. My kaya toast was delicious! Crusty on the outside and amazingly sweet and warm inside. The kaya (coconut jam) flavor was very subtle and blended perfectly with the slice of butter that was slightly melting from the warm toast. What surprised me even more were the soft boiled eggs. Omg. How can something so simple taste so addictingly good?! The cheese toast was just alright. Really liked the milk tea too. Comparable to Hong Kong's cha chan tang's. I saw jars of Hainanese kaya being sold by Toast Box for around $5-$6. I was really tempted to buy it but then I found kaya being sold at Cold Storage. It was a supermarket on the same floor as Toast Box. It wasn't the Toast Box brand but it was only $3 so I went with that instead lol."

I meant the restaurant located at the basement level of Sheraton Towers Singapore, not the famous Chinese poet. The cosy restaurant is popularly known for their dim sum but the other Cantonese dishes were stellar as well, which i found out after sampling some dishes from their Chinese New Year menu. Little appetizers were served and we couldn't stop snacking on the candied chestnuts with sesame seeds. The seasoned dried scallops with chili and dried shrimps had me ask for seconds (sans chili oil). I think there's some XO sauce added to it and it's certainly a good seasoning/accompaniment to the mains.Instead of the regular salmon yusheng, we had the Turbot fish, whose name in Chinese means 'many treasures'. There are fried taro and pumpkin slices in the mix, which gave the dish some added crunch.Next, the Braised Superior Bird's Nest with Crabmeat and Crab Roe. I was delighted to see that Li Bai uses birds' nest as a replacement for shark's fin. Well at least bird's nest can be sustainably farmed so it's the lesser of two evils. I liked the clean and light taste of the birds nest (Li Bai was extremely generous with the bird's nest), which was served with a copious amount of crab roe. Ask for the XO sauce, we heard from the PR girls that it's great with the soup. Next, the Lobster done two ways: Salted Egg Lobster and Sautéed fillet of lobster with greens. Surprisingly, I preferred the sautéed fillet even though anything served with salted egg is faultless. The sweetness of the crustacean could be tasted better with the ginger garlic sauce. The texture was superb as well, with the meat being springy instead of chewy. Stewed ""Eight Treasures"" Chicken with South African 5-head Abalone and Sea Cucumber is the perfect dish to be eaten with a bucket of fragrant steamed rice. Much effort has gone into the preparation of the chicken, which was first stuffed with chestnut, mushrooms, barley, lotus seed etc, then fried and browned, before stewing it for 2 hours to achieve that fall-off-the-bone quality. Abalone was briny sweet and tender too. We ended dinner with traditional Chinese desserts with a twist. This Pan-fried Nian Gao had coconut in it and was more like the Malay kueh. The Water Chestnut Cake hearts were a refreshing end to the dinner as well. Li Bai will be serving 9 reunion set menus that caters to various group sizes from 17 Jan to 24 Feb 2014. Do make a reservation in advance to prevent disappointment!Li Bai is certainly a Chinese restaurant that I will keep coming back to. Great service, environment and food. Mums will definitely love this one!"

Unfortunately after being diagnosed with kidney issues, me eating out has become a luxury and finding food that I'm able to eat has been difficult. However, we did decide to give this chicken rice place a go, with the hope that the food isn't too salty. --------------------------------------------------I love it when places exceed my expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by Roost. I happened to see Channel News Asia (of all places), feature this fairly new restaurant at Centrepoint because of the iKook, a patented machine they invented that supposedly cooks the perfect chicken rice chicken. So we figured, let's give it a shot to see how good it is. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical at first. Special machine, Chicken Rice, in the middle of town, sounds a lot like a tourist trap. However, after eating, I was left.... pretty impressed! Yin Yang Platter ($8.90) As a first timer, we had to try both their chickens and the Yin Yang Platter was the way to go. The portion was pretty decent and I have to say, I was pretty impressed by the chicken. Because of the way it's cooked, the skin remains beautiful smooth and gelatinous, Yet, giving that little crunch (or bounce?) when biting into it. The flavor is fairly light (good for someone like me who can only have very minimal salt now) but the taste of the pure chicken really shines through. It's so good that I could have done without the sauce they drizzled over. Again, do take note that I've been on a no salt / minimal salt (like 120mg max) for the last 2.5 months so my tastebuds do tend to differ from someone who regularly eats out everyday. The rice was pretty decent too, a little like Loy Kee's but less oily. Soup was, well a chicken soup, but I could taste a bit of herbal-ness in the soup, which was a nice touch. The ginger was interesting, being a little sweeter than usual and the chilli. Oh the chilli was good. It was a little sweet when you first taste it, before the sour suddenly kicks in and than the spice. Ipoh Kway Teow Soup ($7.90)This was pretty good too. The soup is light, yet very tasty and the thin Ipoh Kway Teow was cooked to perfection. The flavors were very balanced and the chilli it came with gave a real kick. A good pairing with the portion of white chicken. Chicken Sushi ($4.90)Now this was interesting. I expected the rice to be the same as the one served with chicken rice, but it wasn't! It was chicken rice + more. The addition of fries garlic and shallots, along with the oil, not only help bind the rice into sushi form, but it packed a lot of extra flavor and aroma into the rice.Topped with a very very tender piece of chicken (although I wised it was bigger), drizzled with their sauce and topped with shredded, stringy, fried ginger (that was a nice touch), the chicken sushi might sound gimmicky but it was so so so good. On a whole, I do think the chicken rice here is pretty good. It definitely ranks higher than Tian Tian in my books, and it's a good way to experience chicken rice in a comfortable, air conditioned environment, without paying a chatterbox prices. Considering that they're the new kid on the block, I really hope they survive."

Even though I do love sashimi, I decided to go with an oyako don as I hadn't had a good bowl of oyako don since my last japanese trip!1. Oyako Don $10++For $10++, I was surprised to see such a huge serving. The japanese rice was definitely quality japanese rice. You could taste the fragrance of the rice. The rice also quickly absorbed all the sauces from the omelette and the chicken making it extremely flavourful. I could totally eat a whole bowl of this rice on its own!They were extremely generous with the numerous cubs of juicy and tender chicken meat that was doused in the sweet teriyaki mixture. Served together with the don, is a miso soup which a tad too salty for my liking, but I happily fished out and ate the seaweed. Alongside, you will also get some watermelon slices.2. Ikura Chawanmushi $8++I decided to treat myself with an Ikura Chawanmushi. I love ikura and I love this even more as the Ikura was super fresh and almost melts in your mouth. The chawanmushi was steamed to perfection. It was almost like eating a pudding, a baby with no teeth would have no problem eating this. The steamed egg had a mousse-like textuyre yet withholding the characteristic notes of the egg, prawn and mushroom flavours.I'm definitely ordering this again!Overall : great quality japanese food in a cosy setting. I do hope they settle smoothly in their new location in Tanjogn Pagar and I cannot wait for my next dining experience in Kaiware.Take note : Kaiware is moving to 22 Cross Street #01-50/53 China Square Central Singapore 048423 on July 2016. Reservation contact number 6735 2345 will remain the same."

We got bunch of stuff to try, sated egg York wings, two way Chinese broccoli (half is steam and the other half was fried minced broccoli leaf...OMG, must have) and black pepper shrimp which was ok. You can get either noodles or rice with the meats. We all got noodles and the sauces/chili comes with it is pretty good.

The char siew is good. Chunky and all for the good ones. It's just that for my bowl, there were quite a few pieces with just fat and no lean meat in it. Mind you, I am not even talking about the siew-yok(roasted prok) here. I like that the bowl had some pickled cucumbers as a nice touch to warrant $9.90 but the char siew parts that I got were too fatty.Yes fat is taste but too much fat, especially in chinese cooking, equals oily equals un-stomach-able. My appetite is gone.People order char siew more for lean meat dare I might say. The fatty part could be there minimally. Dare I also might say, that fat cannot be glorified in char siew as if in a chu-toro or o-toro because those weren't as oily as char siew. So stop marketing it that way! The char siew needs to be more refined. I have tasted better in hawker centres.Talk about the roast pork, there is crispiness in it yes. But the crackle wasn't that crispy also. Dark sweet sauce could be provided for pairing. The mee pok noodles were cooked al dente, no complaints. The salted egg chicken wings got cold very quickly. The wings weren't as crispy and fresh as expected, the sauce becomes gooey quickly. A better way needs be come up with to present it other than this usual style.Thought of ordering the platter but the price of rice is $1.50! Also actually, I prefer white rice over chicken-flavoured rice for my char siew rice. That may be why I find it too oily.This place does hold so much potential. It could be a like a fook kin club of roasted delights. The sauce of the char siew is really good, but there needs to be added twist to warrant the price and make the dish more palatable.Long story short this place has got good vibes and respectable food, but it might not have enough to lure me back a second time."

After the multiple media reviews I had high hopes for this place. Alas! My hopes were dashed. While the food here isn't awful, it wasn't great either.We had the cold tofu starter and deep fried baby squid to start with. The tofu was strange with chopped century egg, some salted egg (sic?) and some ikura on top. I felt that it didn't go well altogether. The baby squid was fried to crispness and no complaints about that. This place's staple is the roast platter, and both char siew and roast pork were lacking in fat, making them a little dry. I suppose the fat proportion of a cut is highly subjective, and dependent on luck, but we didn't think highly of it. The noodles were not bad; springy. It did lack some seasoning which were easily remedied with some garlic chilli. However, it could have done with some pork lard (they should have it on all the tables). Would I return? I'm not sure."

But of course, this world's largest Tonkatsu chain do have restaurants in Tokyo, mostly in major shopping malls or department stores. To celebrate the opening of its new outlet in  313@Somerset, Saboten introduces the Iberico Loin Katsu and Fried Jumbo Prawn that are exclusive to this outlet.Iberico pork, which is famed for its refine marbling and tender texture, was not an easier cutlet to handle than the original katsu. Not as rich or oozing juices as you may find elsewhere, the trimmings were rather leathery, and some effort was required to disintegrate the protein. This in particular, is what polarizes opinions.The Fried Prawn Jumbo Set ($28.80) featuring a wild-catch Tiger prawn, crab croquette and original loin cutlet, is more likely to appease the finicky palates with a mixture of seafood and pork. The coating of breadcrumbs for this set of ingredients was also more consistently golden, light and not cloyingly oily. It would be a pity not to try the deep-fried scallops (2 for $12), especially when they are at their freshest and best condition this time of the year. The Hotate Feast is a new seasonal promotion that runs till end Oct.Good to know: there are also Grilled Chicken Set ($18) and Grilled Salmon Set ($21) for those who prefer non-fried food. Yuzu and Goma dressing are imported from Japan. The Tonkatsu Sauce is developed in-house with more than 10 types of ingredients.All the sets are complete with chawanmushi, pickles and yuzu sorbet, not forgetting the free refills of crunchy cabbage, Japan-imported rice, miso soup, that complete the teishoku experience. As usual, you proceed with the old but obligatory ritual of grinding the sesame before adding the Tonkatsu sauce. But what surprises me is that there is also radish and even curry sauces, which I view as privileges that one can't get in Japan--it is usually katsu with one and only one type of dressing. This may not be the place for the impeccable classic tonkatsu but you can still discover some reliable deep-fried gems, if you pick the right ones"

My suggestion is, if you are only dining with one other person, be sure to ask for a full table because they do have smaller tables along the wall. But, those tables are packed in there pretty tight. From this, you won't really be able to enjoy your conversation and your meal as you may very well have somebody you don't know sitting right next to you. And, I mean right next to you. This restaurant also offers live acoustic music on various nights of the week. The performers all seem to be pretty good and what they provide is covers of some well-known tunes.

So when I asked for a new beer because a fly had landed in it they brought me a partially poorer beer that was missing the orange. So I asked if I could get another orange slice like my last beer. Unfortunately this restaurant has a fly problem cause another fly landed in my second beer. They brought me a new beer and this time they told me this would be the last beer. To that I said yes please and remove this beer as it's not my problem you have flys in your restaurant. To this they said it wasn't their problem either? This seems odd to me as I'm used to if restaurants have a bug or rodent problem they actually do need to take some kind of action to correct it. You'll never guess next they explain that they had sat us at a six person table and because a party of six has shown up they would like to move us to the hall way seating.

This is one of those situations where you think, ""I get what you're trying to do, but how do I say this nicely? No.""I get that this is a trendy place; their dark and sexy interior communicates this well. We arrived on a weekday evening, and most of the tables inside were already reserved. We ended up sitting outside, which wasn't bad as they still made efforts to decorate this area and create an ambiance. The food sounded promising, and there was a lot to choose from. I almost want to say that they're a little confused, as their signboard mentions modern Italian/pizzeria even though there is page after page of Asian inspired tapas and dishes.We ordered a Caprese salad and their Morning After Pizza, which includes a fried egg in the middle. The Caprese salad was amazing. All the ingredients were fresh, and I still remember the beautiful texture and saltiness of the proscuitto. Unfortunately, the Morning After Pizza fell very flat. We couldn't taste anything, which was surprising considering all the toppings that were on there- the roasted mushrooms, the egg, the minced parsley, the melted cheese. Maybe it was the tomato sauce- perhaps it needed more salt? For a place that has ""pizzeria"" on their signboard, this concerns me greatly. I leave my review at 3 stars because they have the ambiance down, and it seems like a great spot for tea or some snacks. I wouldn't say I'd avoid this place completely, but for pizza in this type of setting and for those prices, you'll find me at Extra Virgin instead."

A pretty face. No substance, no umpty-ump.Back to the review, on the surface, Supply & Demand has really got it going on. Beautiful interior, great atmosphere, good looking people, modern ambience. We started off with the Caprese Salad and it was sublime. The tomato, Caprese and rocket, I mean arugula... doused with olive oil is a must have.  Our second dish was the Morning After Pizza. A tomato based mushroom, bacon pizza topped with soft egg. It tasted like Card Board. Ok that's harsh, but really with all those toppings lumped together, how could it be that bad... We may have gotten a bad batch, but it's as if the pizza was pre-cooked, refrigerated, heated and then served. The soft egg was not even center, so the lucky person who got that slice was the only one who had a chance to taste it.In short, Supply & Demand is my Adriana Lima.

Of course there was plenty of vegetarian fare to be found in Little India.. but if I wanted Indian food all week I would have just gone to India.That being said, there was not a huge selection of vegetarian items at Supply and Demand but the kitchen was very accommodating towards our needs and modified pastas and pizzas on the menu accordingly. We really appreciated that the kitchen was willing to add in extra veggies as needed instead of subtracting the meat yet still charging $22 for some tomato sauce and mozz.I LOVED the decor at Supply and Demand! The space imbues an industrial aesthetic in the form of concrete floors, reclaimed wood tables, and exposed ceiling beams and pipes. The dim lighting completed the urban feel of this trendy eatery. It seems to be a pretty popular place as we had to wait about an hour to be seated (at 8 pm) and as we dined there seemed to be an endless flow of patrons. The crowd was predominantly people in their late 20s-30s sans children; I'd assume this means the late night scene at the rooftop bar is pretty fun.Overall, a very pleasant experience and I definitely recommend Supply and Demand to any vegetarians seeking a meal with Western hemisphere flavors!"

Don't get me wrong. It is not entirely quiet (as in no customer) kinda quiet but it's the certain ""zen"" that it exudes the minute I stepped in to this restaurant. First off -  no queue. And second - price is reasonable. And third - good food. Go straight to the superstar when you order - Pork Gyoza either panfried or boil, depending what you fancy. If you want something other than pork, the Prawn gyoza is a good choice too. Besides gyoza, the waitress would recommend you an in house special called jia jia men, a noodle dish which is pretty similiar with the taiwanese version (jia xiang mien). I dont like it as i felt it lacked of taste but found myself ordering my last two recent visits. (i have no hope, i know). Upon serving you jiajia men, the waitress will tell you to mix everything in the bowl and once you're done eating half portion of the noodle, she will then add in ""hot soup"" to it and a half boiled egg into the soup. So for the price of one, you get to enjoy the dry version and then the soup version. Selling at $6.50 per portion, I thought it's a pretty good deal. If you;re still not full, the garlic fried rice and the Nikujyaga (braised beef in stock, i think) are pretty decent. I would def come back from time to time."

I am usually not a fan of gyoza as it is usually sticky, mushy or has a thick layer of dough.I am pretty much blown away with the gyoza here. The dumpling is nicely crisped on one side. The skin is very thin so you do have to deal with chewing through to reach the filling. I had the pork gyoza so the meat was moist and very juicy. Dip it into the sauce and topped with ginger and you have a winner. There are 3 types of fillings now - pork, vegetables and prawns.I also tried the jyajya  men. I was curious about it as there was an instruction sheet on each table on how to enjoy it to its maximum. It was basically chewy noodles with miso paste, minced meat and green onions. Add vinegar and chili oil (or chili flakes) to taste. I found that to be a bit on the bland side, maybe I did not add enough  seasoning. Halfway through the noodles, you could add the soft boiled egg (the server would bring it over when you tell them you wish to have the egg), more miso paste and a bit of the noodle water to have a soupy eggy noodle. This was much better as the additional miso paste did give more taste to the noodle. The highlight is still the gyoza. Order a plate or three. It is that good. The pan-fried version that is."

The skin was thin and crispy and the filling tasty and balanced. I also had the boiled crab gyoza and while they were really nice, I still preferred the fried pork ones but this might just be personal preference.A nice plus is their condiments: they have a range of condiments (including sliced ginger - my fave)  on the table so you can mix your own dipping sauce (in my case: heaps and heaps of ginger with black vinegar and a dash of chili oil).

Having opened at the old Heeren since last year, it has introduced new items to meet the ever-changing consumers' tastebuds. One of my favourites picks was the all-new Crab Gyoza $7.80, an interesting and flavourful twist to the traditional meat filling. Made with fresh crab instead of frozen crab meat, each dumpling is wrapped with the exact same amount of filling, churned and measured to perfection by the machine.The other new dish is the Tonkatsu Udon ($6.80). The creamy broth tasted like Ban Mian Soup--light but no less oily than a Tonkotsu ramen. The ""udon"" belongs to the flatter Kishimen Udon that is popular in Iwate prefecture. It resembles Ban Mian, but softer in texture.Pan fried food tends to win over steamed or boiled ones because they have the extra fragrant burnt aroma. But hey, the Boiled Pork Gyozas($4.80) are not too bad either. Succulent and well-seasoned, the skin is just slightly thicker thus chewier than Xiao Long Bao. I thought the chefs were pretty clever to drizzle them in sweet miso sauce. Too much meat? There is always the Vegetable Pan Fried Gyozas($4.80), just as freshly made like their gyoza siblings.  If you like unfiltered sake, this is one of the places in Singapore that actually imports this premium brew from Japan.Gyoza-ya also prides itself as being the first to serve this Jya Jya Men($6.50) in Singapore. Not to be confused with the typical Chinese or Korean bean paste noodles, Jya Jya Men is an Iwate prefecture delicacy that ranks together with Wanko Soba and Rei Men (Cold Noodles) as Morioka's Top three Noodles.What's the difference? The noodles and the way of eating. Either Kishimen aka flat udon (same as the Tonkatsu Udon) or the usual thick udon, are topped with Minced Meat Miso & Cucumber and eaten with chilli oil and vinegar. After emptying the noodles, the staff will add a soft-boiled egg, more miso minced meat and some boiling water that was used to cooked the udon. Stir everything and you'll get this greyish broth. Doesn't taste as rich as it looks but neither is it as slurpy as ramen broth. I loved the Yaki Azuki Gyoza out of all and felt that it needn't be eaten as desserts towards the end of the meal. Sweet red bean mash encased in thin, crisp shell that reminded me of my all-time love, the Croissant Taiyaki. Never mind if there isn't any butter since they're probably healthier. Matcha, Sesame and Yuzu Ice Cream ($6 each) imported from Hokkaido are also wonderful sweet endings, though the red beans were undercooked. The biggest draw factor is the price. With the gyozas at an average $4.80 for 5 pieces and other food not exceeding $7, it's possibly one of the best deals for Japanese food in Orchard."

I tried to make myself available but every time I'm ready, something caught up. It's kinda sad when I am away from home most of the time with very brief period each time when I return from abroad. But I know I can't find excuse not to visit this time in Jan when I schedule my unplanned return to SG. I have been eating dumplings in Australia and they were mostly made by the mainland Chinese who flock the country of late. But I wasn't expecting the same at Gyoza-Ya, simply that I have read reviews from reputable accolades and I know they are one of my trusted source. I reached the humble outlet prior the dinner crowd: the time reads 6.15pm. There's ample tables to go around for 4s but 2s were almost taken up. The wait staff was polite and obliging to give me a table near the corner of the restaurant when I turned down his offer on the small table next to the entrance, neither a bar counter seat is welcoming, I told myself. I was given a small slip of order list that spells what the restaurant offers. Quite extensive given the size of the humble eating place. The service was very prompt and attentive. My Yuzu Cha arrived quickly and order was taken attentively. I was such a glutton that I ticked so many dishes that they seems to battle for table space when they arrived.  The soup udon was so flavorful that I can't bear to let them drained any unconsumed broth into the sink! The thick slab of char siew was equally good!! Tender and very well marinated, a good layer of lean plus fats goes so well. The JyaJya Men on the contrary didn't fare that well, perhaps the miso wasn't as robust. On average, the udon has a good chewy texture but still, I prefer the round udon to flat udon, the latter has a tougher bite. Gyoza-Ya serves only flat udon. Red king crab dumplings are a must eat. At $7.50, I got 5 plump gyoza filled with juicy minced crab meat, it's a premium dish in affordable price I must say. I like my dumplings boiled every time I had gyoza, even when I had them abroad. The pan fried pork dumplings were excellent too! Not greasy and there's a faint sweetness from the chopped cabbage mixed in the minced pork. The fried soft bone chicken chunks was crisp and addictive. I like the fried batter coating, it taste like the prized crunchy batter bits from long john silver fast food chain! Salty but a delightful way! It's a hate it or love it dish if u don't mind eating soft cartilage. What I least like was the tofu topped with minced beef, the seasoning in the beef just taste weird which I find no words in describing. I'm sorry. But the tofu has a silky texture. I'm glad to have made the trip tonight. Now, I can strike one restaurant out of my to-eat list that goes on and on whenever I leave my home base. Gyoza-Ya, indeed an inexpensive dumpling house that every foodies should at least try once. YUM!!"

The noodles were smooth and delicate but slightly bland even with the goma sauce. I suppose the point was to appreciate the texture of the noodles. Meanwhile the teriyaki chicken was a little too sweet and sour, and didn't really taste like teriyaki at all. Indeed it was kind of like shredded jerky.Gyoza is what this place specialises in. The gyoza were bigger than at other places and the skin was smooth and not overly-thick like at some places. However the gyoza were not sealed so the meatballs inside fell out sometimes. Also the taste of the pork inside was a little odd. The gyoza sauce here seems to be a mix of, among other things, soy sauce, vinegar, oil and sugar. This compares to vinegar at many other places.We also had 2 types of noodles: jyajya men and tonkotsu udon. Jyajya men is like the Japanese version of Chinese zhajiang mian - noodles with a black meat sauce on top. Unfortunately these noodles were rather bland - more sauce was needed, and the sauce wasn't all that fragrant in the first place. It got even worse when, as recommended, I cracked in a soft boiled egg, added some sauce and hot water - it was even more bland. The tonkotsu udon was much better, being served in a rich meat broth.We also had seafood fried rice since the portions were quite small. It wasn't bad as far as Japanese fried rice goes (I think because they fry it on a grill instead of a wok it doesn't have much wok hei [smokiness of the wok] that Chinese fried rice has), but there was hardly any seafood inside. And yes, the portion was small to.The individual dishes are cheap but they add up to more than you'd expect! With two cups of green tea it added up to $40.60."

OMG, Gyoza-ya, where have thou been all my life?The Yaki Buta Gyoza, aka the pan-fried pork Gyoza, is a MUST must must order. I already had high expectation from all the rave reviews on yelp, but I was not disappointed. The thinness of the gyoza skin, the perfect sear, the delicious minced pork that went so well with the vinegar sauce - just blew my mind. It's the absolute star of this restaurant. In fact, next time I wouldn't bother ordering anything else and just order multiple servings of this.It's 5 pieces per serving by the way. I think i can easy eat 20 of these by myself.However since I had to meet the $25 delivery order limit, I ordered other stuff too. Namely:Sui Buta Gyoza (boiled pork dumpling) - meh. Maybe bc it was delivered, i find that the thinness of the gyoza skin, which is what made the pan fried version so amazing, does not transfer over to the boiled version. Also not a fan of the sweet sauce that they douse all over it. I may have liked it more without the sauce.The garlic egg fried rice - this was much talked about on yelp so I gave it a try. And... I mean, it's good, but just like garlic fried rice in other japanese places.Broccoli aburi - meh. This was a weird deep fried(?) broccoli with bonito(?) flakes on top. Not really a fan.Ramen egg - i only needed another $2 to get to $25 so I threw this in. It was a good ramen egg, but it's what you should expect in other japanese places as well."

The chicken rendang is definitely one of the better ones around as the chicken is still moist and not hard and dry. I do like the decor with its posters of Marilyn Monroe and other famous stars of the yesteryear.

What I remember to be the most outstanding is the beef rendang, with a perfect balance of spices forming an amazingly fragrant dish. Other recommended dishes include sayur lodeh, tauhu telor, and tapioca plant. For the brave-hearted, you can try the ox tongue, which has an acquired taste and texture and definitely does not appeal to everyone. Those with a low tolerance for hot and fiery fare will be up for a challenge, seeing that they are that generous with their spices. However, just eat the dishes with the generous portion of steam rice served and there should not be a problem."

There is only one thing I liked here, ie service. One word summed up the whole experience: meh!FOOD 3/5Despite the layout to give an impression the range of food was extremely extensive, the food was mediocre at best. Nothing really stood up, nothing to rave about. It was disturbingly mediocre for the price and venue of this lunch buffet. To me, they are just lousy calories I was consuming. AMBIENCE 2/5The tables and chairs were arranged so close to each other. It was like a dining hall in a college but those tables and chairs in my college were not even that close. It was a pain to walk between chairs at different tables. And mind you I am not even that broad. I had to be careful not to bump onto any chairs on both my sides. Also, I find some of the patrons Triple Three attracted were .. how should I put it nicely? Hmmm.. ok there is no way but to be blatantly honest here, the word is ""selfish"". I witnessed some patrons would took all the pan fried salmon after the chef cooked a batch of them and placed in the tray.  Clearly there was a line behind. These people were those who would go to any buffet and displayed their lack of etiquette and wanted to make sure their consumption was worth every penny they spent. SERVICE 5/5The staff who took care of our table was really friendly and attentive. She would clear our plates promptly and refilled our water. Moving forward, I would not even eat here for free. Even a top notch service would not move me. It is such a pity. Sorry, but not really.Triple Three = 3 3 3 = 9/3 = 3 Stars :PA little update: My brother just told me what was the cost per pax for lunch buffet at Triple 3, almost S$100 including tax per person!!

The food was okay, but it was hard to get food. Instead of laying things out, Triple 3 prefers to have their staff serve you, so that creates lines all over the place. For instance, they cut your sashimi to order, so that takes a little longer. Or the snake of people in line for naan, which blocks off most of the indian food area. The pasta station only had one burner, so it was also a wait for pasta. There was also a line at the tempura station, and the tepanyaki station. I have never been to a buffet that required so much waiting in line. I think this is a big issue, and I won't be back because of it. The lines die down towards the second half of the meal service, but that means I have less time to eat.In terms of quality of food, the salmon sashimi was okay, but the swordfish was very watery. The tempura was well done, light and crispy. The pasta was okay. The meats were not very flavorful. Despite being offered a variety of food, I found my plate constantly filled with the same items, usually items that don't require me standing in line. There was a one-for-one special if you use a POSB/DBS card, so we took that offer. They actually didn't bother to verify that we had the card before giving us the bill. I think the buffet was meant to be cheaper...please don't ever pay the full price for this. For $78++, you can do a lot better."

My favourite, however, is the outstanding tempura live station where the batter is as good as it gets. I hardly finished sampling the entire spread given over 8 counters to choose from, every culinary station hardly disappointed. the roast and indian are highlights done rather well at a buffet where I would have expected less given the quantity. But here there's no compromise on quality too. If you love seafood like I do, the crab legs and succulent prawns, are juicy and sweet with a fresh ocean savouriness rather than a stale fishy taste that I've had at other buffets.Kudos to a great buffet spot,  but it's always packed, so do book early!"

It may only be cabbage, but the freshness, crispness and sweetness of the cabbage helps cut down the oil in the Tonkatsu, making it easier to finish. The soup that comes with it is perfect as well. These aren't simple bowls of pre-mixed miso soup as well. Made with carrots, Radish (daikon) and pieces of pork, these little bowl of soups are stars of their own, helping ensure the sweetness of the cabbage and its sesame sauce, doesn't over power the pork loin, allowing its umami-ness to shine through. To ensure that we don't over eat or overload ourselves, we tend to order a Jumbo Ruso set with an additional rice set ($4.00) to share, which is more than enough for us. Overall, we really love the restaurant and really can't find any fault with it. Simply love the Tonkatsu here and still our go to place whenever we have the craving for it!"

The place is nice, good sevice and quite similar to a Tonkatsu-ya in Japan, food is not exactly cheap.I loved the miso, tsukemono, brown rice choice and all the sauces. Shame for the main thing, which is the tonkatsu, it wasn't all that great, quite dry despite me ordering the Kurobuta Hire which is meant to be the best pork that they have on offer.ALl in all I have had better, but it's a decent option if you are in the area and really want to eat Tonkatsu."

Can't say I'd eat here often or even come back again, but I felt pretty satisfied after polishing off my set meal. The restaurant was half empty(full) when we walked in around at almost 9pm on a Friday evening. They had a ""MisoKatsu Fair"" special at the time: sizzling negi miso rosu katsu set (pork loin with negi miso sauce and egg) for ~S$24++. Pork fillet went for a dollar more. FYI pork fillet is also known as tenderloin and is the leanest of all cuts, so it's a healthier choice. My friend got the pork fillet, and it was less flavorful in my opinion. The chefs cook the meat in a open kitchen right in front of the bar, so you can see the marbling of the meat before they fry it up. To be honest, I expected the pork to be cooked with a bit more skill or technique. Although the meat was very high quality, the end result was just like another fried piece of meat. The sizzling platter was a nice touch as it kept the food warm, but it wasn't a testament to the cooking. The side dishes were nice, but nothing spectacular or unique.After adding on a chocolate cake dessert (just for good measure), the damage came up to about S$35. Glad I tried it, but not willing to pay this much again for some fried pork cutlet."

They give you a scoop of rice, japanese cabbage salad both with unlimited serving and a small bowl of miso soup. I get that they serve many types of pork but the quality just isn't there. I have had much better tonkatsu elsewhere. I was really disappointed with my dish. Since you can't go wrong with rice and cabbage, my grief is with the other items on the plate. I had the mangalica rosu katsu and guess what, the meat was stale, not crispy, not tasty, and jerky. Other people who think this place has the best tonkatsu either they haven't had real good ones or I was just unlucky to be facing a gruesome experience here. It's really a nightmare for me. The cashier was nice though. On the side note, you may want to put the sauce on the side, because your tonkatsu might get soggy by the end."

I loved it. Well, I also haven't been to Tonkichi in a really long time and that used to be my go-to place for gd tonkatsu, but my bro said this place won over Tonkichi when he went on a tonkatsu hunt with his gf. Anyway, I don't like very fatty cuts of meat, so I went for hire-katsu and it was deliciously juicy! As other reviewers have mentioned, the tonkatsu tasted really light and not soaked in oil as is typical of not-so-good places. It was amazing and made me very happy. I got the 120g portion, which actually didn't look like very much but was pretty filling. $22.80++The tonjiru soup, pickles, and cabbage are all free flow. Soup was delicious! And had a ton of ingredients.. Very comforting and brothy and hearty. Cabbage dressing was also very good, went well with cabbage. OH, big plus for being able to get brown rice! I LOVE brown rice. and at no extra charge. Makes me even happier :)Only thing is that I like Tonkichi's actual sesame seed grinder (sort of like mortar and pestle) as opposed to Ma Maison's plastic container thing that effectively does the same thing. Oh! But Ma Maison had both spicy and sweet tonkatsu sauce, never had the spicy one before. Pretty interesting. Liked both of them!Orange jelly that came after the meal was really strange and artificial tasting though, skip that.. Service was okay, took a while to get anyone's attention, I suppose things were getting busy on a Thursday night. It took a while for them to give us warm water and I had to keep asking for more though."

Ok, take this as you will, I'm from nyc and obviously not from Japan, so my opinion might be a bit skewed, but still very much honest. I have had tonkatsu many times in nyc/nj but at ma maison, it was the best I've ever had. The service was great, super friendly and very helpful. It's hard to find good service like that here so it was really refreshing to see that again since I left America. The miso beer and sweet potato sochu...awesome! My boyfriend ordered the black pig tonkatsu and he wasn't impressed. The meat was tough, and I'm not sure if its because it might have been a little overlooked or maybe that's just how the texture is naturally. I actually enjoyed his dish. Yes, it was a bit tough and chewy, but it was still juicy and flavorful. I had the tonkatsu fillet and, again, the bomb! That dark sauce is salty and flavorful, plus the nice shredded PILE of cabbage. The sticky brown rice was also fantastic. It was nutty and hearty, just awesome. I want to find out how to make that, because I can get used to that kind of brown rice! Not cheap though. 2 drinks and 2 meals was $100. Thank god the food was good."

When my craving for katsudon hit me last week, I made the rare special trip to orchard on a weekday to have some katsudon and was sorely disappointed. I'll cut to the chase. The service was appalling. I understand being rushed and busy. I was perfectly happy to wait. However, I do not appreciate being shooed out of the restaurant and made to feel like it was my fault while the manager, I think, scolded the waitress for almost sitting us before another couple that we (and apparently the waitress) hadn't realised was waiting. Embarrassed, we walked out and endured the glares from that couple although all we had done was said 'table for two?' When we were seated, the appetiser came in a very rushed rambling of the description as though he didn't have time for us or this at all. We then proceeded to wait eons for the food until, after realising we kept looking over, the manager finally came over and said 'There's some quality issues with the white rice. We are cooking a new batch now. I think you should change to the brown rice.' When told that 'no, we would prefer to wait for the white rice, thanks', he kept trying to convince us to change our minds before, defeated, he went to the kitchen to check how long it would take. Incredibly, two seconds later, we were told that they weren't sure the second batch wouldn't have the same quality issue (in the white rice? Really?) and we should take the brown rice. 'Should' was being used in a 'you should take it or you have no rice' sort of way. At this, we had no choice but to agree to the brown rice. At this point, I'd like to say that I have nothing against brown rice, but my partner really did not want brown rice and was willing to wait for the white rice anyway.The katsudon did arrive with very little rice drowned in the sauce. It definitely wasn't a good katsudon sauce either and the lack of rice made for a too salty too sweet katsudon. Perhaps they were running out of brown rice, seeing as there isn't any white rice apparently. There wasn't an apology though he did appear at the end of the meal and asked 'did you like the food'. We just smiled, as we didn't want to deal with him anymore, but it was an awfully disappointing experience. In fact, I was still thinking about that satisfying katsudon I never had the next day, and went to Ginza bairin for dinner promptly. I wouldn't recommend people not to go for the tonkatsu, but just a word of caution about the service. Also, I've heard the service at the Bugis branch is much better anyway. For that price and quality though, I'd just go for the cheaper Ginza Bairin's chicken katsudon set. It's much much more gratifying."

Having never patronised T before, it was a clear winner on the freshness list, and we were warmly greeted by chirpy servers. We were quickly served balls of chilled, grated radish and a detailed look through the menu saw us ordering up Mameton, their self proclaimed bestseller, an Iberico pork set, and an Ebikatsu set. All orders come with a side of rice (plain or multi grain), pickles and soup.Taste wise: wow. It's a clear difference between pedestrian pork, dished out in the Mameton set, and Iberican pork. The breaded crust (panko?) was delightful to bite into, and not cloyingly oily as katsus are wont to be. The Iberico was well marbled, I.e. fatty, which provided a juicy burst or meaty goodness with each bite. It's not to say that the regular version was shoddy, but it just paled so much in comparison when side by side with the Spanish cut. The ebikatsu wasn't too bad, though strangely I adored the side of finely shredded cabbage. Icy cold, the servers would come around offering extra servings of fibre, which went very well when liberally doused with the accompanying sesame dressing. In addition, the meals come with roasted tea and a small cube of jelly as dessert. The flavours seem to vary daily, and ours was peach - cold, clean tasting, and not overly sweet. Price wise, three sets came up to shy of $100, though it also has to do with going for the premium pork. I do enjoy the service though, we're hard pressed to find sincere and friendly waitstaff around here. And the fact that it consists of cute Japanese blokes makes it so much more of a rarity!"

Wow, pretty impressive.Good morning Nanyang is small and convenient, right by the Chinatown station. I got a honey lemon drink, while my mom got a complicated version of coffee. Quick service on a weekday afternoon. There's also a buzzer to let us know when our food is ready. I had traditional toast, good but nothing special. Orange ciabatta with butter was surprisingly tasty! A little sweetness, but not too much. Nicely toasted and not too much butter. Love it!My honey lemon drink was nicely done. Not too sweet but not too bland. My mom also really enjoyed her coffee, and has been frequenting this location for awhile. I wouldn't make a special trip to visit, but if I was by chinatown and was looking for a short break or snack, I will definitely stop by. P.S. there is free wifi if you need some!"

The coffee was nice but it was not sweet. Perfect for those who always order their drinks as ""siu dai"" (less sweet) as this is their normal. I requested for more sweetness and it was still not as sweet as the drinks you get at Ya Kun or Killiney or Toastbox. The rice which came with the chicken curry was very hard. It looked like it was scraped from the bottom of the rice cooker. Either that or it was old rice. Being a Monday I would not be surprised if they actually served leftover rice. The chicken curry was good, thick rich spicy gravy with potato and 3 pieces of chicken (2 mini drumlets and a mid-wing). It got noisy when packed and you could hardly hear yourself think. There was nothing to absorb the noise. I would be interested to try the other food as they do have different types of bread for toast."

A tad more expensive than the rest but the bread alone already costs SGD$3.00 (promo price). The highlight was the black charcoal bread. A good amount of sunflower seeds on the bread.

We tried to make reservations for 6 on a Sunday afternoon but they were running a full house so we had to settle for the 8 pm slot. Service was brisk as the place was bustling with activity. My favorite dish here is their signature Crab Beehoon 龍記米粉蟹. The thin strands of rice vermicelli had absorbed the rich flavours of the crab jus and brown sauce. The crab was perfectly cooked and delectably succulent. Don't forget to order this dish when you visit. The Har Cheong Gai 虾酱鸡翅 (Deep-Fried Chicken Wings marinated in Shrimp Paste) is another dish worth splurging your calorie intake on. I loved the crispy skin and juicy meat.If you have a weakness for Salted Egg Yolk (like moi), definitely order the Pan fried Salted Egg Pork Rib 咸蛋排骨. The grainy texture and the umami-rich savoury flavour of the Salted Egg Yolk coating around the browned pork ribs adds another level of enjoyment to the juicy meat.

Possibly even better than when the chef-owner was toiling in the kitchens at the now-defunct Golden Spoon Seafood (it was ""that other restaurant"" across the carpark from Por Kee).We had:1) Long Ji Crab Bee Hoon ($): a towering mound of bee hoon drenched in broth with a crab sitting pretty atop, looks impressive but pedestrian in taste. A little disappointing, after all that hype. The lard-tinged broth was sweet but lacked depth, and needed a little spice or piquancy to kick it up several notches. I had to ask for copious lashings of fried garlic crisps, and sambal,for oomph.2) Fermented Pork Belly ($15 for small): another signature dish but wow did it deliver. The bite-sized strips of pork were scrumptious- flavoursome, and juicy. Elevated by that awesome sambal that was at once punchy and lively. I'll return just for these.3) Cereal Pumpkin Beancurd ($18 for small): also lackluster. It was creamy and sweet enough, but one-dimensional in flavour, and missing in that well-rounded savoury component."

Despite us asking our server twice about the status of our pies, and the server both times confirming that they're on their way, an hour passes before we get fed up and ask for the manager.Another server comes over, we calmly explain the situation, and say that if the pizzas are indeed on their way, we should have them comped as we've waited way too long. By the look on her face, I knew she didn't want to do that. So then she goes on to say there isn't a manager on duty, and that she can relay our concerns when he comes back.... tomorrow. Or give him a call. Yup. I will let you come to your own conclusions about that.We continued to push, saying that we'll just cancel it and head out. But she insists that the pizza is already done and that cancelling it is not possible. This goes on for a while, until she finally checks with the kitchen. She comes back, acknowledges there was an operational error, then FINALLY decides to give us the pizza for free.To add insult to injury, we asked for the check as I wolfed down the 2000 and late pizza, only for them to take an additional 20 minutes to run our credit cards and close out our tab.I'm pretty sure that this place has been around for a while, so I wouldn't necessarily say this service lapse is a teething problem.

Only bee hoon is used, no other way about it. It's Hakka style, so you get three kinds of ingredients - fish balls, fish paste wrapped in bean curd skin, and tofu - and the chilli and sweet sauce dip goes with the ingredients nicely. There's an undeniably homely feel to a piping hot bowl of flavorful, soupy bee hoon with some soy beans nestled at the bottom in the middle of the day. Granted, you'd be drenched in sweat after the lunch hour, but resistance is futile. Come early as some of the items get sold out sooner than others.

Some were a bit hard and others not bad.Ribs were only so so. Meat not so tender even though we asked for softer meat.

Located opposite the Tiong Bahru market, there is usually a fair amount of people but I never had an issue locating a seat. I usually go for the big ribs, pork kidney and noodles - all good. Not the cheapest around. That combi that I usually order, with a drink, would cost about $20 for one person.

This style of soup is best if you like to drink heaps of it, as it isn't overly peppery and tastes more like the natural sweetness of pork. I confess I had three bowls of it - free flow right?Perhaps considered a slightly unique preference, I like to eat BKT with innards. They serve a mix of innards here - liver, kidney, and a some large intestines. They serve the innards BKT with the liver slightly undercooked so it bleeds into the soup. If you do eat innards, but dislike them bloody, make sure you tell them about it, or wait a while before tucking into your food.As usual for BKT, you eat them with fried dough crullers (you tiao) soaked in soup, ad salted vegetables, black sauce, and soup with rice.

I suppose Bak Kut Teh is to me what chicken rice is to most other people.Now, the Bak Kut Teh here isn't really the peppery sort, nor is it the herbal sort. WHAT SORT COULD IT BE THEN you ask?It's... the sweet sort. Ostensibly peppery, the pepper here is so mild that you actually get the natural sweetness of the pork coming through. For those of you who've had various Chinese-style pork soups (like, pig stomach soup for example), you'll know the sweetness I'm talking about.That's not bad mind you, some people like the milder, sweeter flavour of the soup.But it's not for me. I like my Bak Kut Teh peppery, with a zing. The other dishes are a-okay too, since it's unlikely you'll turn up just to order BKT.Peanuts, salted veg, youtiao, they're all done decently. The star here though is always going to be the soup, and the 'dragon ribs'."

Add to that a side of of stewed salted veggies and plain white rice, and you're good to roll.

The pork is tender with sufficient give at each chew, and the salted veggies and gravy are complement the rice nicely. Humble fare with homely food - while it's not knock your socks off awesome, it makes a great option for a simple lunch.

The Biachi Funghi, a mushroom with truffle cream white pizza is delicious. Earthy, rich, savoury, I think I'd be able to finish this myself. The Fennel Sausage and Breakfast pizza are also both delicious and highly recommended.The pizzas definite must be eaten hot, and when they are, they're gooey, delicious, and wonderful. I've gone to PS.Cafe Petit more times than I can remember, whether for lunch, or to grab a pizza to bring home, or just for a salad when I'm not inclined to all the local food on offer in the area.This is possibly one of the most underrated pizza joints in Singapore, and while I wouldn't say it's better than Mozza, I can't say it's worse either.

Cafés, the service here is pretty bad. I know that there's no service charge, and it's supposed to be a quick service restaurant (I'm trying to withhold using the term fast food joint here), but the utter nonchalance and bluntness of the staff here is ludicrous.Staffers are supposed to stand aside/make way for customers when they're walking through, but not here. I live nearby and patronize the cafe relatively often, and I always observe them trying to boss their way around, forcing customers to either bump into them or give way. Needless to say I wasn't going to let them push me around, but the experiences I've had were really unpleasant.The positives - truffle fries here are great, and are their pizzas. But my favorite has gotta be the Pullman's panini. Juicy chunks of chicken with mustard pressed between a cheesy and crisp panini, it's one of my favorite sandwiches around.I prefer the food here compared to the full restaurants, which tend to sometimes be over complicated, as they are simple, fast, and tasty.Overall, quite the opposite from the main restaurants.

Scrambled Eggs & Croissant w/ Crispy Bacon ($15.90)Scrambled Eggs, consistent with mine so that's a good sign. The croissant was pretty buttery and was nice and flakey. Bacons were fried nice and crispy (although I'm more of the juicy tender bacon person than the crispy sort).The salad was an after though and came looking a bit limp and old. The most disappointing? The salad wasn't washed clean. The wife was just about to take a bit and suddenly noticed a dead ant on one of the lettuce leaves. Tsk tsk. Big disappointment.

The coffee sadly is very average.There were a lot of design types working away on laptops when I was there and I get the impression it's that kind of place.

My husband swears by their French toast with bananas and bacon, which comes with two nice thick slices of eggy fried brioche, sliced bananas, crispy bacon all drenched in maple syrup! The sweet and savory combo wins him over. For me I always end up with the pork cheek sandwich. I agree with Marcus L, a little bit more toasted would be great. But once Ive sunk my teeth into that porky, cheesy, oily goodness I forget all about it. The small salad that comes with it lets me delude myself of it being pretty healthy.

Somehow it feels genuine and laid-back, which can hardly be said for nearby establishments like Forty Hands and Open Door Policy, both of which have amassed loyal cult followings (quite deservedly) and lost their chill factor in the process. Well I suppose crowds are a good thing for cafes to have, though it would be nice to be able to have a meal without feeling like I'm in someone else's way all the time.These crowds were absent from Flock when we visited one Saturday afternoon for tea. Bit of a welcome change from having to wait in the sweltering heat for a table. It wasn't that the eatery was devoid of people - there was a steady trickle of customers, and the staff looked hard at work.Portobello, mozzarella & rocket sandwich, $13.50 - Since this was supposed to be tea we ordered one of their sandwiches to share. T'was a pricey sandwich, but I liked that the juicy portobello shroom was so big it occupied the entire pocket of ciabatta. This was quite delicious and would have made a substantial lunch for one, though y'know, the pig in me wishes they had fries on the side.They have other interesting offerings on their sandwich list like prawn and avocado, as well as pork cheek and gruyere.Orange bundt cake, $5.00 - Having had a disappointing encounter with a bundt cake the week before, we decided to give the orange bundt cake here a shot. I thought it had a nice citrusy fragrance and crumbled quite satisfactorily, but the others found it to be a little too dry.Mocha, $6.00 - Flock sources its beans from the ever-reliable Liberty Coffee, which pretty much ensures quality coffee brews.

Nope, not  Chye Seng Huat or 40 Hands or 3 Hands or no hands (in fact when we drove out of the carpark at Moh Guan terrace I only realized that 40 hands was around the corner from Flock). We decided on Flock because the dude wanted AM brunch and we try to explore new places on the fly. Flock has all the elements of a coffee-centric hipster joint (this kind of sounds like I'm describing the Manic Pixie Dream Girl): Gentrified neighborhood, check. Bare concrete or exposed ceilings/fixtures, check. Food sources labelled (albeit in this it's ba/cakeries not farms), check.Prices that make me double take, check. Servers that look like my brother's friends, check.Kids in clothes that are like ""This? oh I had this ol' Cambridge satchel at the back of my closet"", check.We ordered a scrambled eggs & bacon croissant-wich and the croque monsieur. The first sandwich kind of worked but the chef needs more practice doing a scramble (heat control dude!). Parts of my eggs were fully cooked and parts were liquid. Without jumping in the kitchen, I'd say go have the big breakfast at Food For Thought to see what I mean by a good, even scramble. The rashes of bacon seemed to be lifted straight out of a packet into the pan because they were all stuck together. The croque monsieur was again, passable but kind of eh compared to the mother of all ham sandwiches at Choupinette.Decent meal delivered fairly quickly. Chilled out environs. The coffee-centric hipster joint experience."

The cappuccino met my standards (taste-wise) and was quite pretty, latte art-wise!I love the ambiance here; for some reason, I didn't find it as cramped as 40 Hands, around the corner.

The croissant was gone in I daresay 3 bites, filling and all, and a croissant sandwich and iced tea coming out to $20 dollars is kinda ridiculous.

I've never been able to make it down to the roaster because of their crazy sporadic opening hours and I haven't really seen it around town that much. But Flock serves it and I drank it. And so far I don't think it's to my taste. The roast just seems too light to me. If the coffee isn't coming through the milk strongly in a double shot piccolo latte then there's basically no point serving it in a milk beverage. Maybe my palate is that messed up from years of smoking but unfortunately it's the only palate I have.Otherwise I'm a fan of Flock, primarily for its quaint neighbourhood vibe and friendly service. As other reviewers have noted, staff are Singaporean (as opposed to 40 Hands) and while I have no problem with Filipino service, I do appreciate an outlet that will pay more for inexperienced locals who actually care about what they're doing. The staff at 40 Hands have never seemed particularly interested to me.The proprietor seemed like a very nice lady who cared enough to serve & speak to customers with a smile. And again, unlike 40 Hands, there was no smug 'we-are-so-successful' vibe about the place. Plus I hate the 40 Hands coffee so this is a step up.While I like their famous pork cheek, it usually feels a bit too heavy for me to take as a first meal of the day. I plump for the prawn & avocado sandwich. I am particularly amused by the Turkish bread they use because it makes me feel like I'm in Melbourne circa 2002. Remember when Turkish bread was a thing, guys?"

The barista is well trained and takes the time to do it right -- it can take 5-10 minutes to get your drink but you can be sure it's done perfectly. I think the cappuccinos here are probably closer to what you'd get in Italy than some of the better places in San Francisco since the coffee beans used here are on more of the delicate side and the milk used tastes more creamy than what is normally used in the US.For food their banana foster french toast is one of the best french toast dishes I've ever had (a big surprise). The bread used looked like a standard loaf but had the buttery flavor and partial texture of a croissant. Served with a light maple syrup and topped with bananas and served with bacon, it was just fantastic!"

The front is open-air with artificial turf that kids can (and do) run around on a little bit; there's also an ice cream cart that you can get indulge yourself at (with the help of a barista from inside the shop). Inside, the ordering area is lined with lots of different bites, especially cupcakes. The enclosed seating area is to the left of the outside area; we didn't actually make our way in there as we wanted to enjoy the (mild) relief that the rain brought. We didn't have to wait too long for our drinks, and they were both solid - mine was a very refreshing agave lemonade that I housed in about a minutes' time; my wife went with a fruity iced tea that was still quite unsweetened and was a much more subtle flavor. We did grab a brownie to share as well; while the texture was a tad chalkier than I like, I did like the faint hint of fruit (think it was blackberry, or something similar) that was baked into it.While it's a tad out of the way, Plain Vanilla is on a street that has a few other hipster-y shops as well, and it's a solid place to grab a brew (or another beverage) and relax/work."

A bakery cum cafe, the place is decorated in a way that allure you to instagram every single corner. They have seats in front of the bakery; even a swing if you prefer. Step further in, you're brought to the food display! Loved the look of everything! Even the glimpse of cake pans and baking tools in their huge cupboard was instagram-worthy. Haha! Kudos to whoever the interior designer was.They sell, tarts, cakes, brownies and etc. Even cookie and cake mixes in jars. How wonderful! But what captivated us the most were the cupcakes on display. Me being the salted caramel lover ordered 2 of those, vanilla and hazelnut chocolate ones. Prices for the cupcakes were alright, standard. But the drinks! Blimey! $7 for a cup of lemonade? Eh?! And oh! You might as well know that they don't offer you any paper bag to stuff your cake boxes. They'll just tie them up with a string to act as a handle. Quite the hassle if you're already holding many things in hand."

The charming entrance greets you warmly with an army of vintage aqua bikes, an open communal dining space and a glass tankard of lemon scented water (they understand the effects of humidity!) The shop itself is lined with daily specials, old favourites and row upon row of Plain Vanilla's famous cupcakes - to me, these are definitely the best cupcakes in Singapore!They have a great texture and deviate away from being outlandishly sweet; I love that every flavour says what it means and means what it says. Must-trys are the Earl Grey and Cinnamon! The cupcakes start from $3.50 each and I usually grab a box of 6; just like the Sound of Music, they're adorably tied up with string! (A useful handle for when you're commuting with cupcakes!) I love the ritual of hopping a few doors down to Books Actually to grab some reading material and then settling myself into a quiet corner at PV Bakery.

And those nibs add that crunch and a touch of that bittersweet raw chocolate finish...

One look at the shop and its location at Waterfront Plaza, and it was clear that this place is not in my price range for an average lunch. I had a grilled salmon rice set which consisted of 9 items in total and it was $19++. In fact, their set lunch was actually impressively extensive from katsudon to udon or soba, to huge rice sets and at a price range of about $16++ to $25++. Although that is not exactly cheap, given the prices of Japanese food that I've sampled in the past month, it is quite reasonable. In fact, the katsudon is cheaper than Ginza Bairin. Service was, without a doubt, outstanding. From the minute I stepped in, I was taken care of, including pulling my chair out, removing the paper cover of my chopsticks, hot towels and hangers for our bags. The location, beside the river, was somewhat scenic but it was a little too hot for dining outdoors. My only disappointment was after the meal. We were hoping to have ice-cream after our meal upon realizing that they had sakura ice-cream, but we were informed too late that they were actually closed at 3pm and so we could not have our dessert. As you would expect from a Japanese restaurant that had Japanese customers, the food was delicious. I had my grilled salmon with just salt but the salmon was soft inside and the skin was cooked to a crisp. There were 9 items in the rice set, namely cucumbers and pickles, lotus root, bitter gourd, chawanmushi, rice, miso soup, the main i.e. salmon, 2 slices of sashimi and watermelon. I especially liked the lotus root dish which was sweet and savoury as well as the silky chawanmushi. For the price I paid, I was rather impressed by the meal which was a lot more than I had expected. I will definitely have more lunches with my friend while she's still working in the area."

It is just so hard to find good salmon belly sashimi, and it is ironic that I find the best salmon belly sashimi not in california, not in japan (at least where I've been) but here in Singapore. In general, my attitude towards japanese food in Singapore is ""jaded"". I feel like in order to get decent sashimi, you usually have to pay an arm and a leg. And usually when I do, I am not impressed by the quality. This salmon belly is well marbled with fat, super fresh, and evey slightly sweet! Even at 6 bucks a slice, I am willing to pay it. The chef recommendation's seasonal dish, salmon roe with soy sauce and yuzu was another winner. The salmon roe was not at all salty (which means it's fresh) and lightly seasoned with soy sauce, and the yuzu just brings finesse to it. The grilled saba was decent, but not impressive. Will definitely come back for the omakase or chirashi or just a sushi meal. Thank you for making me believe in Singapore again!"

I was here during dinnertime and although there was not much of a queue, there was still quite a lot of people in the restaurant.I had the grilled teriyaki gindara set, which was, to be honest, quite average. Perhaps they weren't having a particularly good day, but I found that the gindara here wasn't too fresh and was even slightly overcooked. However, the taste was pretty good to be honest.We also had the tempura, and I enjoyed this a lot. I found that the prawn tempura was soft and crispy, with just a touch of oil and has a very good bite to it. Definitely high recommended.Overall, this is a great place to have a decent Japanese meal with good ambience."

Chestnut in liquid form... no, liquor form!Onto the Yaki: Now you can do this thing 2 ways:- Way 1 if you're adventurous is to a la carte the yakitori; this'll require an exploratory palate and a reliable ""I'm full!"" meter.- Way 2 for the casual is to just go the set... we went the set and there was zero 'gret. Why? They pace the courses out with an explanation for each; they are bang on with bags of flavour; and you get to discuss the current course as you digest; before the next one arrives.Whilst the bincho'ed yaki is exceptional on its lonesome, the addition of condiments like yuzu, black mushroom salt, japanese mustard, and the always welcome wasabi elevates the dishes into the stratosphere!I think this is a crazy good date spot for you tinder fiends, and bumble bees, or if you wanna just chill with a bud and nosh it's also fantastic fare for that sorta shindig.My dining partner and I were hydrating regularly and the waitstaff were exceptional at refilling with ice n' a slice h2o every time we dipped below half glass.Special mention needs to be made of their delightful course description before serving as this adds to the overall culinary experience.If you can find this hidden gem, then you've already discover a slice of Japan in the little red dot!"

The food and cocktails both are extremely great.My girlfriend and I made a Chope reservation to check this place out on a weekday night. We heard about Bincho through the shoutout from Singapore Airlines in their in flight magazine for SG50 and knew we needed to check out this hidden yakitori spot. You find a very nondescript corner of a building with a sign that says to go in through the back of the building where you walk in to what looks like a small tunnel. Since we were having dinner, we walked past the lounge/bar area and sat at the counter, bracing ourselves for some solid yakitori.We went ahead with the Bincho yakitori tasting menu which included:1) An appetizer platter (chicken liver pate with baguette, octopus tentacle with some veggies, and some prawn dish), 2) Assorted Sashimi (salmon, tuna and snapper)3) Soup that you drink then eat its ingredients from the pot (included some fish, a prawn and chicken), 4) Chicken yakitori platter (neck, wing, breast and thigh), 5) Choice of lamb, fish or waygu beef skewered, 6) Japanese tomato 7) Tsukune Don - Chicken patty with rice and egg 8) Seasonal fruits which is japanese peach and grape. We shared one of those tastings then ordered 3 items off their a la carte - kinki fish, veggie platter and these yams convered with pork (looks like mini hot dogs) called Red Monnyaku Kurrabuta Roll. THIS KURRABUTA ROLL WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST DISHES I'VE TASTED HERE IN SINGAPORE. Insanely good, we devoured these in record time. Highly recommend you order that one and the veggies too. Kinki fish was great although it has many bones to pick through.Only thing I wish for is that they use the yakitori sticks for all of the meats they serve. That's usually my favorite thing about any yakitori place, even the Michelin starred ones around the world. For the cocktails, we ordered the Yuzu, Sake, Gin one which was light, refreshing and really nice. The one that really hits the spot is their Mangosteen Cinnamon cocktail which also has vodka. It tastes like a spiked apple cider drink, extremely easy to drink.Service is impeccable, ambiance is very New York/underground Tokyo feel and the food is excellent. I would highly recommend coming here on a date or to impress someone. I for sure will be coming back again and and again."

Some of the pieces of the tori zukushi set were delicious - the assorted appetizer, chicken liver, tsukune with egg yolk, and soft bone karaage stands out. However the rest of the food in the set were bland and underwhelming. But to me personally the star of the night was the garlic pork (a-la carte). The meat was well seasoned, crispy on the outside and the garlic complimented the pork really well. We also ordered grilled squid from the a-la carte menu, but it was very chewy. While I think my meal at Bincho was overall satisfying, I found the price to be too steep for the amount and quality of food we were getting. It was more like a been-there-done-that experience, and I don't think I'll be coming back for their food.

Sets start at $25 before tax and go up to $40+, but you get a drink, a starter (of 2 chicken drumsticks), another starter (of chicken skin salad which was oh-so-yummy), your main and then dessert (mochi or ice cream).They recommended the chicken dishes (it's a yakitori restaurant afterall) but because we were greedy, we had the ikura negitoro (salmon roll, chopped tuna belly with chives) and yakitori sets to share. Portions were reasonable (actually I was already filling up quite a bit before the main came but there's always more room for good food...) and the service was really attentive.Ikura negitoro - ingredients were fresh and good, though it could be a bit underwhelming if just for one. Afterall, there's not much texture in a negitoro don (besides soft and mushy) I'm so glad we decided to share this instead of me having it all to myself.Yakitori - the slices of chicken were moist and tender, I loved the grilled skin as well. And it looks damn good on photos in case you want to make your friends jelly. (HI IM IN THIS COOL PLACE WITH AWESOME FOOD AND YOU'RE NOT, is what I sent to my boyfriend in Brunei)The restaurant is divided into 2 areas, 1 dark and claustrophobic (and you're all sitting at 1 side of the table, facing the bar, but not AT the bar, because there's an alley between you and the bar counter) and 1 bright and airy with a nice view of the chefs grilling the yakitori. You know which one to choose.(Btw I now know where the cool entrance is and I will be using it for my next visit)"

The bar is also diverse with many Japanese microbrews, sake and even an all-you-can-drink beer deal on Sundays. I guess the one difference between Tokyo and Bincho is the price.

That's usually my favorite thing about any yakitori place, even the Michelin starred ones around the world. For the cocktails, we ordered the Yuzu, Sake, Gin one which was light, refreshing and really nice. The one that really hits the spot is their Mangosteen Cinnamon cocktail which also has vodka. It tastes like a spiked apple cider drink, extremely easy to drink.Service is impeccable, ambiance is very New York/underground Tokyo feel and the food is excellent. I would highly recommend coming here on a date or to impress someone. I for sure will be coming back again and and again."

Bincho looks wonderful. It's set up in an old Tiong Bahru coffee shop, has been retrofitted with many bells & whistles and yet manages to keep the romantic old school vibe while still providing a comfortable modern dining experience. That is a big achievement. Unfortunately that is where the achievements end.My dining partner and I went for their two omakase-style sets (Bincho & Fuji) that were semi-delineated on their chalkboard menu while leaving some room for the chef to make decisions. We were really quite disappointed with both the quality of the food and the quality of the service.Firstly, on the food. I get that Japanese food is supposed to be simple. But that doesn't mean it's supposed to be average. The beauty of being a master Japanese chef is that you can use the natural flavours of your ingredients in a simple execution to deliver deliciousness. This did not happen here. There were too many courses for me to call out individually but the food was uninspired, often bland and not even remotely appearing like value for money.Those two sets and a beer with the ++ we are accustomed to ended up at $250+ for two. Not the most expensive meal in Singapore but certainly not the cheapest. But where is the value? We received several (I mean like 4) sets of yakitori pieces that I have seen better executed for much less money at Ippudo Tao. Dessert consisted of a single strawberry and a slice of rockmelon. The chawanmushi was plain egg with a single scrap of meat. I could go on.This was capped off by service that lacked any kind of finesse. Staff were obviously inexperienced at service for this price point. English language was poor, explanations on dishes were unavailable and etiquette was lacking (case-in-point, if you're a waitress, don't stand around in the dining room on your phone looking bored).The donburi course was presented as consisting of ""chicken thigh"". Upon closer inspection, there was clearly no chicken. When I highlighted this to my server, he first suggested I was wrong. When I challenged him to show me the chicken and pointed out that I could see fish cake, mushroom and egg, the response was ""of course it's a mix lahhh"". I politely suggested he should check with his chef. Upon returning he informed me that it was a completely different dish to what he introduced when he served it. With no chicken and no apology. In a related aside, where is the finesse in a rice bowl with supermarket fish-cake, egg and basic enoki mushrooms?Not good enough Bincho. Why should I spend $250 at your restaurant for bad food and bad service when I can go to Ikyu around the corner and have an infinitely superior meal? Answer - I won't again."

Fortunately, Lor Mee 178 was worth the plunge and is probably the only Lor Mee I'll ever eat. (Please stay that way forever.)Here's the breakdown: you get a bowl of noodles in the thick brown gravy but that's not all, you also have fried shark meat, crispy fritter bites and more crunchy stuff topped onto your noodles. That might be what made it for me. The mix of crunchy with flavourful sauce that not too starchy and good noodles that blends with the sauce. I've read very opposing views on this dish, perhaps from people who prefer to more traditional braised variety but I like this adaptation. I will travel just for this one."

While the fritters themselves were well fried, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the sharks meat and normal fish, though. Having this exotic dish already also means the stall could scrimp on more traditional accompaniments to lor mee - I couldn't find many pieces of egg, or ngoh hiong in my bowl of noodles, which, if not for the sharks meat, was nothing spectacular.

We chances upon this place and the first thing I noticed is ""home-cooked"" hainanese food. My friend did not take port so we did not order pig trotters bee hoon. We asked for recommendation. In the end, we had ginger chicken which is one of their signature dishes, samba prawns, and long beans. For the portion of 2 people, it's just ok. Not too heavy and not too light.  My friend asked whether he could order one more veg. So we ordered broccoli. Yet he wanted to be spicy and the cook was able to customize the order and make it spicy. The bill in the end was $62. 4 dishes, 2 rice and 2 lime juice.  Reasonable price I would say. Because it is a home-cooked food kitchen, they are more flexible to customize orders and at the same time, very little MSG which is important. I also notice that the food was not oily like that I see in other food courts or hawker centers. The only thing is that they don't accept credit cards. So remember to bring debit cards or cash before you go. They also do not open on Tuesdays."

Pork chop was very nicely done, it had the crispy-and-juicy combo just right. The portion size was just right for me, though I can think of a few people who would complain as the rice portion is a little less than usual. I throughly enjoyed it. Price tag to a pork chop curry rice = $9. Their menu looks has your usual flair of Hainanese dishes. The table next to mine had at least 2 families and the dishes on the table looks great. Look forward to going back there to try.A few tips : 1) if you have a party of more than 2, please call ahead to book.  2) it is a coffee shop setting, so it can get pretty hot especially in the recent weather3) following from no. 2, if you are sitting inside, sit somewhere in the middle.

It shares the space with a yong tofu stall, a vegetarian dish stall and a kopi and drinks stall. This is also the former storefront of Two Face which is now closed. Their main staple is their home-made pasta and they change their menu from time to time.  The way it works is really the same as any of the other yong tofu stalls, you place your order with ah bong (or his friend) and pay.  You then take a seat at one of the tables and a kopi uncle will approach you to take your orders for drinks.  They made their own pasta (I spotted a pasta maker in the corner) so you can be assured that the pasta is fresh. So far I have tried their vongole (which comes with al dente linguine and fresh clams).  The quality is pretty consistent as I have tried that a few times.  I have also had the pappardelle pork genovese (ribbon pasta cooked with pork, wine and onion) which is very rich and tasty.  One thing I noticed is that the pasta is always cooked right.  They also offer desserts - the early grey infused creme brulee was not bad, not too sweet.I find this localized Italian eating experience very interesting.  Ah Bong only operates in the day but it's a good way to enjoy relatively inexpensive ($6-9) quality pasta in an al fresco setting with the Monkey King Temple right in front of you and hey, if you also crave yong tofu, it's right beside you when you finished the pasta!"

I'd been wanting to try this place for months but I can't leave my workplace for lunch and it's only open from 10am - 2pm. Finally, a day off after working throughout the night. I was starving when I came here and we all know that hunger is the best seasoning. I was here with renowned Yelp food critic, Josh T, my TB food buddy, as his workplace is in the area. We tried the Mac and Cheese with Truffle Oil and the Warm Bath, which looked nothing like a pool of water.Food- The Mac and Cheese looked nowhere like Mac and Cheese. More like penne with cheese in a bowl. There was more pasta than cheese (in the other renditions I've tried, it was the other way round). Not necessarily a bad thing- I liked it as it was light and not overtly creamy like the other versions and it was very affordable at $3. Truffle oil was worth adding as the dish would have been rather bland without it. Sauce reminded me of Pastamania's turkey bacon cheesy crumble sauce. Not an insult as I like that dish (yes I know my street cred disappeared the moment I said that).Warm bath was penne in anchovy butter with an egg (almost Onsen-like) and long beans. It was unexpectedly plain-looking and I would have preferred more toppings to go along (how about some real anchovies hmmmm). Very affordable at $7 but between this and something else on my next visit, I'd choose the latter.Service- Ah Bong/Chris was very friendly and attentive, asking us if we were doing ok etc. Coffee shop uncle kept on telling me that I couldn't have the cup of coffee that I'd bought from Tiong Bahru bakery. 3 times. Ok point taken.Ambience - don't come here if you want ambience. This is a coffee shop.More like 3.5 stars but because Ah Bong was nice I'm rounding it up. Would return."

Came at 9pm and all ribs and burnt ends were sold out. So I got the $60 platter with brisket, pulled pork and links, with sides of mac and cheese, cornbread and brisket beans.Not the best Texan bbq I've had, but in Singapore, this might be the best there is, and I suppose that needs to suffice.The beans were a bit too sweet and not mellow savory enough for my taste, but the chunk of brisket inside made for a pleasant surprise.The mac and cheese was pretty good. Enjoyed it thoroughly.The cornbread did not come out as I expected. It was definitely not southern style cornbread. But it did the job of soaking the juices, so I give it so merit.The brisket is flavorful, moist and fork tender. So tender that if you try to lift it up with just your fork, it might slip off or fall apart before it reaches your plate. Which is what happened to me. It's a good thing.The pulled pork was a bit too sweet and too wet. The rub isn't savory and spicy enough.. perhaps it's tweaked to suit local palettes? but I thought you serve authentic Tex bbq? hmm....... oh also, I get that they're trying to avoid people ever calling out their meats as dry, but this was a bit too wet.. on the upside, there's more juices to wipe the cornbread with.The links were the most meh. The beef links were good, but the lamb and pork were meh.The letdown was the pork belly burnt ends for $12 / 100 grams. I know what burnt ends are supposed to look like... this did not look like that. On its own, as its own dish, ok fine it's meat, well smoked and bbq'd.

Beef brisket is cooked over wood and served dry with sauce on the side.I'm a little partial to Kansas and Memphis style barbecue (dry rub), but I definitely end up here when I have a craving for American barbecue. Please skip the other places like *cough* Morganfields cos this is definitely far more legit.The place is named after Elliot Decker, the chef/owner, who learned the ropes in Austin.4-stars relative to what you can get in Singapore, 3-stars if compared to other places in the United States.

Texas? Kansas City? Memphis? Carolina? All would claim their barbecue is best. Of course none of this matters when you live in Singapore and develop a craving for some, any good US barbecue joints. Yes, there are a few but this latest place may claim to be the best yet. It really is that good. We went looking for it having read a posting on another website talking about Decker Barbecue which had only just opened behind Boomerang at Robertson Quay. We arrived to the wondrous  sight of healthy portions of delicious barbecue meat being served to patrons in a simple open air restaurant. The menu is simple as you can see from the photo. We ordered a couple of Brewdog beers (the only non Non-American beer  that they stick) and strode to the counter to order. And then heartbreak as the staff started to put Sold Out signs on the Brisket. Denial!Disappointed but not broken we ordered turkey with pulled pork and chopped beef with the two side dishes of Brisket Beans and Potato Salad. Service was fast and very friendly (in truth a rarity in Singapore). However good as the service was, it was the quality of the food that was the star here. It was simply fantastic. The sliced turkey was very tender and the right side of moist. The chopped beef had some spice with great flavour and the pulled pork was the first one that we finished, so that should speak for itself. The brisket beans were great with enough brisket in to give us a hint of what we were missing, with the potato salad trailing behind a little in the flavor stakes. From talking to Elliott and Min,  the partners of the restaurant this place is clearly a labour of love. As their first week in business at the location finished, more sold out signs went up. Disappointing for them and the customers who came along only to be denied. For sure they will make sure this doesn't happen again and for sure we will be back to try the brisket the next time.  For those craving some fantastic Barbecue, don't miss Decker."

They take great pride in their work, and it shows through the well executed smoked meats. I particularly like that they use a variety of local wood (lychee last time I was there) to impart flavor. Having said that, I don't know if the food at this price point warrants multiple revisits. The experience brings you close to the familiarities of proper bbq, but nothing puts it over the top. You leave full, but not entirely satisfied. I've been here twice, and frankly wouldn't come back unless I had a rare hankering for Southern bbq.

The staff was also extremely unknowledgeable about the menu, so we ended up having to point out what we wanted on the menu.Looking at previous yelp pictures, the food offer has also changed: there is less variety in the sashimi, no crab legs or grilled prawns anymore. Nevertheless, I must admit that I really liked the quality of the sashimi and the tempura was not too bad either.You would probably be able to convince me to go again for the sashimi but I'll have to forget about the service and the seating arrangements first so it might take me a while before I'll go again!"

For a Japanese buffet in Singapore, this is quite cheap!I found the food here surprisingly good, and sashimi here is fresh and thickly sliced. They are not stingy, but you will have to be very specific with your orders. Everything else like tempura and grilled items are the same standard as what you will find at Sushi Tei. For what you pay, really, this place is a bargain. Service is very iffy here, and they are quite under-staffed, but you can't ask for too much when you're not paying top dollar for reasonably acceptable food.

Quality of sushi for Asia is minus to mediocre - at best. As an avid traveler and eater, I have had my fair share of sushi. My best experience thus far has been in Japan at the tsukiji fish market. I would rank this in terms of quality and taste as the worst sushi I have had in Asia thus far. I would also rank many places in America above this restaurant. Their service and staffing is fantastic though.Specifics:Temperature of the sushi: warm.Cut of the sushi: excellent thickness.Quality of the sushi: poor quality, very muscular, stringy, viscous and low fat content. Flavor of sushi: potent fishy taste, the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna all taste the same. Temperature of rice: rice was cooler than the sushi! Big  no no.Quality: grainy and lacks the traditional ""sticky rice"" feel.Flavor of rice: average. Sushi to rice ratio: 1:1 ratio, which is fantastic.Conclusion: This is a no go."

You go NTUC buy sashimi oso $95 per kg aredi. So if you got big belly, confirm can eat enough to cover the price. Remark: Much less crowded than when I last came in 2013 - possibly because of the recent sashimi scare. Which is good if you are not a typical Hamji-porean, because less crowded means prompter and better service."

It's got a good size piece of chicken and half a crabstick. The egg is soft and tasty too. As good as the ones I make at home. 2) Fried Fishcake with Cheese - its really the normal Fishcake with a hole in the middle and the melted cheese together with the fried-ness. Nice! 3) Salmon Sashimi - generous, fresh thick slices of salmon yummies. You order by the slices so that awesome! 4) Teriyaki Salmon - they grill the salmon pieces till nicely charred on the edges and the thick teriyaki sauce is a great accompaniment for the taste.

This buffet is a-la-carte style and the variety is decent enough for you to be a little bewildered about what to order. A must-try (over and again) is the sashimi. Salmon, yellow-tail, tuna, octopus, hamachi - eat your fill. The tempura is also well-done with a light batter coating fresh vegetables and crunchy prawns.What I like about the vibe of this restaurant is how it isn't too posh looking - the interior is modest but exudes a nice sense of familiarity.

The restuarant itself had a humble feel to it - nothing too formal. It does a good job of recreating the traditional Japanese restaraunt atmosphere - for the seats on the side, you can even take off your shoes to sit cross-legged, Japanese style. Even the Wordart emblazoned on the menus can be nicely disarming - a nice, if unintentional touch. Sashimi was great and came in many varieties. I enjoyed the salmon, although the tuna itself was not that fresh (neither does it give the choice of parts). Compared to other Japanese buffets I've had, however, I found the variety lacking. They did not have the assorted vegetable tempura, not the baked scallops or bacon rolls I've been spoilt by. Nonetheless, the dishes they did have - chawanmushi, karage chicken, shishamo and tempura - did not dissappoint. Come here for a good meal, but leave your expectations at the door."

What could be more fun that making our own popiah from the piping hot claypot that is served within five minutes after the table is laid with all the other ingredients. Optional condiments like the sweet Chinese sausages can be ordered starting at $4 for a small plate.Priced at $18 for 6 skins, the pot provides more than enough fillings unless you stuffed each of the skin to its maximum. We had no problem  finishing this pot just by itself because the julienned bang kwang topped with mini dried prawns were juicy and fragrant. The popiah skin is resilient enough to withstand the excess moisture, though we encountered several failed attempts to transport our masterpieces into our mouth without breaking the skin.The stir-fried baby kalian ($10) that boasts a vibrant fresh shade of green, are crunchy yet permeated with the breath of wok hei. The stewed pork is yet another rich and delicious braised dish that comes with the standard white buns ($16). The bonus slices of yam escaped the humdrum of a typical stew pork bun that is stuffed only with lettuce leaf. The Fish Head and Yam soup ($16 for small) did not look inviting but received praises from the tables for its wholesome flavours. The slurry broth is furnished with subtle sweetness from the napa cabbage and yam. And the deep-fried slices of fish were meaty and delivered comforting aroma that would be impossible if they had not brush encounter with bubbling oil. But the star of the night is none other than the Pig Trotters Bee Hoon ($14 for small). One can relish in the homemade goodness of this dish that is moist but not too wet. Napa cabbage, mushrooms, bean sprouts, bits of eggs and crunchy shrimps bolster the flavours of this dish. Everyone was obsessed with this dish despite being stuffed to the brim with the earlier dishes.This is a reliable restaurant that you can count on for some wonderful heritage dishes. Just remember to place a reservation in advance especially during weekends if you do not wish to join in the queue."

I try to be fair yet critical in my yelp reviews, but this restaurant really is over-rated and expensive for the quality of food they serve. The DIY popiah set is the worst I've tried and yet they're selling at a very premium price. Mind you, the set comes with just very basic ingredients and selling for $26, $46 and $66. We ordered the $26 set and it comes with 6 pieces of popiah skin, sad-looking lettuce and beansprouts, shredded egg, and a small bowl of turnip filling. Pathetic. If you need to add on other condiments, they're sold separately. The popiah tasted rather bland. Disappointing. Looking at the portion, we knew we would still be hungry so we ordered the pork trotter bee hoon. They charge $21 that just is enough to fill up 3 small bowls for us. Nothing more. And the waitress was so unprofessional, she didn't portion the food properly, my bowl was filled with bee hoon and vege, while my colleagues' have most of the pork trotter bits and nothing else! We also ordered prawn paste fried chicken ($16) that was really bad - dry, tasteless and salty. I was in complete shock to know the total bill came up to $80+. NO, I won't take any chance in the future. The restaurant is in need of a revamp especially the food items and pricing. They could easily slash the price to half, otherwise, even though with a 30-year-old history, it won't warrant a return visit from me... ever."

Not well taken  Good chance has been a favourite for not only  Popiah but Hokkien food for many many years. One search on Google for the best Popiah in Singapore and Good Chance's name will definitely be on a list somewhere. I've had a few chances to try their popiahs so far but strangely never at their restaurant. The first time I had it was when the GF's mom ordered in for CNY (I know.. Crazy expensive but oh well....). The second time was at the Heritage Fest's ""A Taste of Heritage"" at The National Museum. Both times I thought that it was pretty good Popiah. The Bangkuang was sweet and succulent with the carrots adding an additional sweet essence to it while the skin was not too thick and really tasty. Oh... And the Chilli gave quite a kick too. So with the Gf and family being in the mood for Popiah, I couldn't be more excited when we decided to head over to their restaurant! Taking a quick glance through the menu, we decided to go for the set menu for 4. Do note that this could easily serve 5-6 if you're group does not have big eaters. 4 Pax Set Meal ($108.00) Good Chance Popiah. The star! The signature dish! The the the.... Let down. What happened to the Bangkuang?! What happened to that sweet, yummy filling I had at home and at National Museum? While it was still tender and juicy, it lacked all the natural sweetness of the ingredients that should have come from the Bangkuang, carrots, cabbage, bamboo shoots, shrimp etc and it tasted a little... Diluted. While the chilli still packed a punch and the Popiah skin still thin and yummy, the sweet sauce was clearly diluted as compared to the one that came with the Home Made Prawn Roll.Fish Maw SoupThis turned out to be the star of the set meal for me. It was tasty, generous with fish maw and crab meat and it wasn't over starched. One of the nicest, simple, fish maw soup I've had in a while. Cereal Prawn While the cereal was nice and not too oily, the prawn itself was..... Kinda tasteless. It was crunchy and a little sweet, it tasted a little like frozen prawns. Like the kind you find in fried rice. Baby KailanWhile the way they fried it and the flavour of the seasoning was nice, the baby Kailan tasted a little old. That slight bitterness had started coming through the leaves but it was still a decently fried plate of Veges. Home-Made Prawn Roll I love my Prawn roles. Crispy, juicy, salty, sweet, dipped in a beautiful sweet sauce, the prawn roll is one of those many comfort dishes. This one however was a little disappointing. No much flavour, not much texture. Tasted almost like my first attempt at making wanton, where you add a whole load of seasoning, only to cook it and wonder where all that seasoning went. Certainly not a favourite. Fried Vermicelli This would definitely be the biggest disappointment of our dinner. It looked good. Moist, full of ingredients (it was meant to be a seafood vermicelli) and it looked ready to erase my memory of the lousy seafood Beehoon I had yesterday (Xing Lou Seafood White Bee Hoon). Unfortunately, it became my second seafood noodle disappointment in 2 days. While Xing Lou just tasted salty, the Vermicelli here tasted of absolute nothing. No seafood, no oil, no soya sauce, no salt.......Nothing. It just tasted like plain Vermicelli. Logan with Almond And Mango Jelly. Aka left over ""stew"".While there was Yam Paste and mango pudding on their main menu, we ended up with the ugly step sister. Fair enough, it was a refreshing end to dinner but you can't really get it wrong with canned longan and factory made jelly. Sadly I was quite disappointed with the overall food. While the staff were friendly enough and the waiting time for food is not long at all and the food all being served piping hot, the quality unfortunately wasn't up to par. There were a few dishes we like, a few we thought were just alright and a few we really didn't like. Overall with the service we'll give it a solid 3*. Food alone I'd give it 2.5*. Is success getting to its head? Maybe.... But a lot more needs to be done to ensure that this heritage restaurant continues surviving."

The soup is also flavourful without tasting fakely sweet. 2) Silver Fish Fried Rice - slightly too salty and very savoury indeed.

Unfortunately the soup seems fishy even as only few slices were fishy. I remember that it came with pork cracklings default but it does not. Only after finishing it I overheard some customers asking for it. The crispy bee hoon with seafood and egg was in general good. However some part of the bee hoon was tough which is because it was not fried enough. The sauce was good but the vegetables taste was slightly off. It seems ought as the place seem to have a fair bit of business so the vegetables should be fresh. Both the fried pork chop and prawn paste chickens were good but you can get almost similar quality from other restaurants. They were marinated enough to give them distinct taste.

There are probably other places with equally fresh and good fish slice bee hoon soup. But the prawn paste chicken wings are fabulous! I would go there for that. The chicken was served hot, fresh out of the fryer. Crispy skin with the taste of prawn paste, and moist juicy meat make a very good fried chicken indeed. The vegetables we had was equally good. Fresh crunchy greens simply stir fried with hint of butter. The day we went for dinner, it was sorely understaffed. There were only 3 waitresses on duty and the restaurant was running a full house. It was quite a wait for everything - from getting a table, to getting a chair (table was missing a chair), to being given a menu, to taking our orders. However food was served quite fast after the order was taken and we went straight to the counter to pay our bill as it would probably take a long time to wait at the table. Apparently there was an event that day and most of the staff were on duty there. The poor aunty waitress said they barely had time to breathe while coping with the dinner rush."

There are no questions of whether you want milky or clear soup here because it's all milky--and the milkiness comes from the long brewing of fish bones. No milk here! I can feel the nourishment already. There is a choice between thick and thin fish slices (also fish head, but I don't like bones, so)--that really is a matter of personal preference, though I do like feeling I am getting more fish with the thin slices, and there's a nice ""crunch"" that isn't there with the thicker slices.

It's way better than the puny fish slices in the regular version. Prawn paste chicken - umami at its best. Hot, juicy, piquant fried chicken dipped into chill and then hungrily savored. Need I say more? Black bean beef horfun - tender beef slices, fragrant spring onion, flash fried with springy horfun. Wow. Just.. wow. The dessert menu is typical, though the deep fried yam is a thing of beauty - not cloyingly sweet, and encased in a light, crunch batter.

I can't fault him since this is probably the only place that opens for dim sum at 8.30am. When he first said ""Red Star"", I was like ""Red what??"" I have never heard of Red Star despite I was born and raised in Singapore. Personally I believe if it was any good, my dad would have brought us there when we were kids. Notice I used the ""was"". I yelped the restaurant and had already prepped myself with the 1970s decor. I didn't expect it was so bad until I seen it with my own eyes. It was dingy and tacky. The location of this restaurant was not the easiest to find until you arrived at the building. Saw a sign indicating Red Star is located on the 7th floor. There was an elevator next to it, I was horrified when I entered it. When the elevator door opened on the 7th, I had no words. After following the signs, finally got into the restaurant. Yes, the decor was stuck in the 1970s, but I still can deal with it. After we got seated, the male staff asked what kind of tea we would like. His mannerism started from indifferent to rude.I looked around at the table setting in front of me. My plate was greasy. My bowl was dirty and so was the soup spoon. By this time the male staff came with a pot of tea and a metal bin of cups lying in there. He just left them on the table and walked away. And yes, the tea cup I pulled out from that metal bin was dirty too. Anyway, guess we would have to pour our own tea. Then came the highlight which was the dim sum.This restaurant has probably the worst dim sum I have ever eaten in Singapore. Honestly I never have awful dim sum in Singapore, this special award really goes to Red Star.Just to highlight a few items : 1) Siew Mai (pork dumpling) - F - it looked unappetizing, there was no flavor to it, the meat tasted weird2) Cheong Fun with BBQ pork - F - zero flavor, and the BBQ pork tasted weird too3) Egg tart - F - it was fresh from the oven, but the crust too dry and the custard part has no tasteAnother female staff was so rude when my relative asked if there was any egg tart. She basically said if it was ready, it would already be out.Rude service, awful food and overpriced for this kind of dim sum someone actually has the guts to serve to patrons.  I say those who like the food here do not know any better. It doesn't matter this place has been around for a very long time, things that are old are not necessarily good.And not to mention, the air conditioning was almost non existent here. Any self-respecting Cantonese will never give this place any star beyond 2. I chose a 1 or none."

While dim sum here isn't the best you can get in Singapore, the entire dining experience here make up for it. To be honest, I've never heard of this place before until a group of friends talked about it and decided to bring me here for lunch last weekend.  Red Star is located on the 7th floor of a HDB flat (Block 54) within the Outram neighborhood. The restaurant is super retro - dim lighting, a center stage (for wedding singer or sort) and a huge main dining hall. The dining hall is filled with tables and chairs arranged in the most compact way to maximize the space, a common sight in any chinese restaurant.  We learnt that there are 2 ways to come up to the restaurant - one through the main door and another through the kitchen (back door). I think GOD knows that we're a curious bunch, the elevator we took lead us to the back entrance of the restaurant. We walked pass the kitchen, an oily walkway, through a few peculiar looking doors that says ""RED STAR THIS WAY"" before reaching the main dining hall. And then we saw the main entrance on the other side with people already queuing up trying to get a table during the peak brunch period. Lucky for us, another friend was there much earlier and already got a table when we reached. Service here is world class. Middle aged ladies with their headgear (like Emirates airlines) graciously push their cart to your table recommending and introducing different dim sums available for the day. They speak fluent cantonese and limited english but good enough to understand if you have any visitors or caucasian friend who cant understand mandarin or cantonese. I ""interviewed"" a couple of them and learned that they have been working here for the past 20+ years and take pride on their job. And with that I truly understand now that despite the average food, people still come back for its exceptional service as well as comfort food that's friendly to the wallet too.  Red Star is no where near any of the ""finer"" dim sum outlets we get in Takashimaya or 5 star hotels, but if you're looking for something different with a local touch, unpretentious, where you can talk and laugh as loud as you can then this place might be the right choice. I highly recommend this place."

Some of the trolley ladies don't holler out their wares, so you're gonna have to ask what they're hawking. I tried practically everything less the congee, and I have to say I am not impressed with the food. The rice rolls- argh. Too salty and dark a sauce. The siew Mai, forget it. The prawn dumplings had skin that was too thick and prawns within were unremarkable. The egg tarts had uneven levels of egg, and was really soso. I also tried the banana prawn fritter, and the skin was probably fried at the wrong temperature because it was oil-soaked yet not very crispy. The spring roll was dripping oil from it's too-thick skin. They also ruined my favorite dimsum item, the liu sha bao(custard bun), where  the bun was filled with a flowing custard that tasted of freezer burn! Other failures include the char siew bun, which had very little filling, was cold despite being in a steaming cart, and was awfully sweet. Just... weird. I don't know how this place survives. I don't care about the deco, I want my food. It cost about $50+ for two, but I feel it wasn't worth it at all. It was too expensive for what it was."

I am not too young to find the place smell of old people, neither too old to find this place reminiscence.Food. It seems time essentially kept the food tasting great ""just like old times""; both a compliment and a tinge of sarcasm. Compliment becos it still gives us a wonderful memory of the old HK dim sum taste like, and yet when the quality and evolving tastes has improved, this place has not. I am sure many of the customers have tasted better and more exquisite dim sum in HK and Singapore. But where can you find such reminiscence in this present day? Surely you can afford to pay for some historicity!Service. When compared to the other food places this has an army of people watching over our shoulders offering us the multitude of dim sum choices and the time to explain how each of them is special. Truely an experience only found in an old HK restaurant.The teacups came in a pot of hot water, just like old times. The pushers ( the people pushing the carts) is more varied; both old and young. It's not fair to keep those ladies working over 20 plus years thou some of them still do.New dishes. Apparently, they do add new varieties of dim sum, and have quite a number of ""newer"" deserts in their carts, those you can find everywhere else. They taste just like everywhere else so these I am not impressed! No historicity.Price. A bit pricey since we are paying for some historicity here, especially when you get to taste some of the old unchanged flavours dim sum in a old HK setting. Food is average. If you can get the ambiance and the historicity like me, those are the stars. If you want better food and a nicer modern ambiance with more cute looking or younger service people, leave the Q.Oh... The fragrance. I have to say something about the smell of food when I came thru the door. Suddenly I am reminded of the HK restaurant back in 1990 when I first met my HK in-laws! Yes.

Be sure to try the US roast duck, shark's fin with crab meat, fried garoupa in tomato sauce and their butter prawns, amongst some of their best offerings on the menu."

But all the better since it does make the food taste like victory! Be sure to arrive early since they don't take reservations for daily operations, and is one a first come first serve basis. There is usually a long queue that stretches all the way to the lift landing, so don't make the same mistake as I did, and arrive with a starving stomach, you won't be able to resist over ordering!  My staple dim sum dishes would be their fluffy egg tarts which are crisp around the edges and a soft pale yellow in the middle that looks healthy and non-artificial. The usual accompanying dishes would be siew mai, prawn dumplings with huge whole fresh prawns, and chicken feet if you can handle it! Their service really brings us back to the old days, where there are dozens of little Cantonese ladies pushing carts filled with goodies, going round table by table to serve you.

An experience to behold. It embodies the gaudy Chinese restaurants of your dreams (or nightmares). There's a certain charm to it.It's also an important piece of our food heritage. The people behind Red Star are also a part of the Heavenly Kings quartet, the four-some who redefined Chinese food in SIngapore (and some say Malaysia), by creating and inventing some of the dishes we now take for granted, like the yam ring and even the Chinese New Year yu sheng. It's a massive hall where people -- lots of people, and sometimes the occasional celebrity -- jostle for seats from the moment their doors open, especially on weekends. The stage that tells you you shouldn't attempt singing, on which so many of our parents' friends got married. The gaudy tablecloth. The dimsum trolleys.The food isn't great anymore.Especially considering the shift towards 'fine' dimsum, ordered off menus in restaurants far higher end than this.There's a tendency to automatically class this as ""kopitiam dimsum"" because it isn't the super refined Cantonese-style dimsum we've all gotten used to, and therefore say this isn't good.But it's still good. Especially considering how little you're paying for this, how authentically old school everything on the menu is, and what a funny, awesome, nostalgic experience it is to eat here each time. There was a period in 2010 or so when the food standard declined dramatically to the point of inedible, yes, but I'm glad to say that these old farts are back and their hargow and roast meats can out-heritage, if not out-class, all the wussy Crystal Jades and Imperial Treasures of the world."

As a kid, I enjoyed the fantastic delicacies they had. We stopped going there for a couple of years and my recent visit to Red Star was pretty disappointing. While the restaurant's age is showing through the dated decor, the old fashioned carts being pushed around by aunties serving Dim Sum still gives the place a nostalgic charm. The food, however, is no where near the standard of what it used to be. While the char siew sou is still pretty good with its buttery and flaky pastry with a moist, flavourful char siew centre, the rest of the Dim Sum we ordered did not impress. The standard of their pau (steamed buns) have dropped and the buns we got were rather stretchy and had a slight alkaline aftertaste. The siu mai just did not work for me. We ended up ordering congee to fill our tummies as we sort of lost faith in the dim sum there."

It is a traditional Chinese restaurant with traditional CHINESE service - rude and no manners. The food was terrible. So, I thought the staff were busy on weekends therefore provided bad service. My parents were visiting, so I brought them there on a weekday and get a second opinion. My parents did not enjoy the food, every dish was lousy. There were very few choices to choose from. THe worse part was, the servers were very political. THey condemned each other. When I wanted to order some fried dishes, this server said, ""It is not my department. You have to ask that lady. That lady is very grumpy. Don't order the fried stuff, they are not good."" in Mandarin. I got to walk to that lady to get her to come to our table. She was not serving any customer yet she was impatient while my parents making choices. In conclusion, we never went back there since 7 months ago. I will not recommend to anyone."

It has the feel of an old canteen, reminding me of those desperately-trying-to-look-old, kitsch cantinas so popular in Mexico City, with tiled floors, posters on the walls and vintage marble tables, a bit crammed on the inside. To the untrusting observer, The Tiong Bahru Club may appear to be one of those places where form is more important than essence. However, the environment ultimately works and the place feels strangely authentic and inviting.The first interesting thing are the two different menus: East Asian and North Indian. Both of them contained snippets of information, kind of ""explaining"" the dishes. We were told to choose what kind of menu we wanted to have, so we chose the Indian menu (I'm always keen on Indian food). We had a very good, fragrant and spicy fish curry. Then I tried the masala chicken liver, which was spectacular. It was rich in flavour, while at the same time full of subtle surprises. I could say food tasted almost home-cooked, there was a special level of care involved. There's no way I couldn't love that.It must be hard to keep the balance of style and substance in a restaurant. My first impression of The Tiong Bahru Club was that of a place favouring the former. It is always good to be proven wrong. Here, style is no more than the background to a sense-appealing meal. I will surely come back."

My friend's biryani was delicious too: light and fluffy, tasting of gardens.The outdoor seating was the perfect blend of the aircon from inside and the heat of the sidewalk, with people watching and a good breeze. Decor is cute and appealing - a blend of the club and the chaiwallah stand which both supply the place. The issue was that our server was quite obviously completely new and pretty inept (sorry, buddy, but you were.) He said they offered chai by the pot and let us order some - by the pot - but they only serve it by the glass, as the server who brought it over explained after our mystified glances at the solitary cup. He also said they were offering their Bento Box special but when I tried to order it, turned out that's only available on weekdays.

I know.. What's new right? Located at the corner of Eng Hoon St. And Seng Poh road, we've seen this place transform from an old coffee shop (our favourite Loo's Hainanese curry rice used to be here) transform into this upmarket eatery. At first glance, this place looked like just another upmarket, snooty diner, filled with expats, yuppies and a certain breed of Singaporean females that have a certain preference for guys I should not name. Anyway... What got us trying this place was the nostalgic feel and the fact that it did not serve the usual eggs Benedict, breakfast sets, waffles or pancakes, and they certainly didn't promote themselves as the next big coffee joint with magical beans from the bottom of the Amazon River. Instead, what this place specializes in is... Indian food and chai!! Surprise surprise! Well.. I guess it made sense considering that the Brits and the Indians / Sikhs have long had a history together. Anyway... I'm a sucker for indian food so this place, despite how hard I tried to say no, still got the better of me. They have 2 sets of menus here, an Asian menu, with fried rice and soto Ayam and an Indian menu. We decided to go for a Murgh Dum Briyani, my favourite Palek Paneer,a Masala Chicken Liver and what better way to wash down our food than with a nice pot of Himalayan Sikkih tea.First came the Briyani. A good sharing portion that could easily feed 2-3 pax. The rice was wonderfully fragrant with the spices and flavours beautifully infused in and the chicken, despite being the breast, was tender and oh-so-flavourful. So good in fact that it just might be one of the best Briyani's I've had in a while. Next was the Masala Chicken liver. Now this dish was the star of our lunch. It is literally to die for! The liver was nice and tender and the sauce, with all its onions and spices was amazing. Every bite was a dream and this dish is enough to bring us back for more. Finally the Paneer, my personal favourite. The sauce was nice and smooth without the spinach being over powering while the cheese was smooth and ""bouncy"". Only thing it could do with was a little more salt, otherwise it was another very good dish. The tea itself was nice and fragrant and proof that chaitime, the guys behind this restaurant, know their teas. Overall, it was s wonderful experience and the only reason this place didn't get a 5 is down to a few simple factors. A) indoor searing was a little tight, with most 4 pax tables nearly touching each other and effectively becoming a 3 top. B) service was slow as well, with the 2 waiters clearly being inexperienced and frankly a little lost most of the time. C) food did take a little longer than it should, with U.S. almost finishing our Briyani by the time the paneer came. D) the prices. A little on the strap side at around $20-$25 per pax for an Indian meal. Overall, I love how they kept some of the coffee shop's elements while updating it, leaving a nice nostalgic feel, down to the music choice. We'll definitely be back for more!"

Not familiar with the vibe which I guess is like an old timey coffee shop or harkens back to colonial times. Am always uncomfortable with that bc yeah it might've seemed cool but was not cool for the majority of those not in the elite. Anyhow it was cool enough in the evening inside and they had mixed chairs and cool wood floor etc. just be careful if ur inside and then you moved your chair back and one leg falls off the elevated floor and u could fall and hit ur head. The food was actually pretty good - the Indian food only. We had chicken not the spicy one and it was juicy and citrusy and delicious. Also had the Dahl and the baigan bartha and naan and plain rice and one more thing. But it was all tasty and very spicy but good. The service was meh. I asked for ginger ale and they said no we don't have it. I pointed out on the menu where it was listed. Was advised they don't have it anymore. Asked what on this list they had. They have juice and coke. There were five more things listed. Ok I'll just have water. Have to flag them down if you want anything so they don't check back. But at least they don't bother you and let u stay to chat. They're not clearing ur plates as soon as ur done which was my experience in most other restaurants in Singapore.

I went here on a friend's recommendation but either the management has changed or they were having a really bad night. The service was so bad it was comical. I don't see how any restaurant can charge prices like this when they offer such poor or no service. The menu prices were quite expensive.We struggled to get drinks. One waiter barely spoke English and when we did finally manage to order he would take an order  from 1 out of 7 people and disappear. We'd try to call the waiter back and he would take another order but forget half of the drinks. So we had to send our son to the bar to remind him. Then they ran out of beer. There was wine on the table but noone knew how much it cost.The food we had was OK but nothing to rave about. we only got a few entrees and this was only because my husband ordered them earlier as he had arrived 1/2 hour before  us. We had to get up and get our own plates as the waiters forgot.  After we had been in restaurant for 1.5 hrs we asked how our food was going and discovered the order had not been put through. The waiters were inept. We left as we'd run out of patience by then and everyone was grumpy.What was supposed to be a special birthday dinner was a disaster and I had 3 tired hungry children you feed at 9.30 pm.I've had better service in a hawker market for a fraction of the price!

As we were planning to visit another restaurant after this, we only ordered 2 dishes - both of which are my favourite ones here. We started the meal with a large plate of Drunken Cockles (S$20 / US$14.67). The juicy raw  cockles had been cured in soy sauce, Chinese wine, garlic and topped with some fresh chili padi (Thai chili). The copious amount of minced garlic imparted a lovely flavour to the dish but doesn't make for a good dish to indulge in if you're on a first date. Another signature dish here is the Curry Crab in Claypot. Even though it's been a long time since I ate here, the rich, creamy curry gravy was as good as I remembered. The flavourful gravy was a perfect complement to the smooth strands of boiled Beehoon (rice vermicelli). The medium-sized Sri Lankan Crab was succulent and so big, it was almost spilling out of the claypot! The Crab dish set us back by S$ 75.40 (US$ 55.28) before 7% GST & 10% service charge. The beehoon is priced at $5 (US$ 3.67) per plate, which though pricey is worth a splurge to be able to fully appreciate the flavourful curry gravy. If you stop by here and have a decent tolerance for spice, do order the Drunken Cockles and Sri Lankan Crab Curry."

I'm saying like the size of your face huge. Hidden away on a side street by Outram, it's easy to miss this restaurant among the various other zhi char stores nearby, so do come prepared with directions in hand. Open all the way from 11.30am to 11.30pm, many old regulars living in the area drop by for late night indulgences in their signature crab dishes, and I've seen many order crab to go as well. Their top selling dish is obviously the chilli crab, but if you're tired of the usual like me, do try their Butter Crab. It's served drenched in a thick creamy butter sauce, and lightly seasoned with crushed garlic for a plate of steaming fresh delicious seafood. The sauce is also lighter than the spicy chilli or heavy black pepper taste, so it's easier to allow the natural freshness of the crab to be picked up by your palette. This means you can actually appreciate the crab meat and not just the sauces. Their fried Man Tou (buns) are no joke either, dig in while they're hot to enjoy the crispy brown surface and steaming white insides. Dipping it in any of the sauces from the crab dishes just makes them a hundred times better! Price can range from about $30 to $50 per person if a large group for 4 - 6 are sharing 2 crabs, which is definitely more than enough!"

A homegrown favorite SPRMRKT has expanded and set up shop at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI) Creative Workshop & Gallery. I've walked past several times but only noticed their bistro concept SPRMRKT Daily. Little did i know that their Kitchen & Bar, which serves refined European food, is tucked away upstairs through a side stairway.The spot is absolutely gorgeous in the day with expansive views of the idyllic riverside. Lunch sets are offered, starting from $30, served with coffee or tea. They have also started their weekend brunches and we say grab a table now!For lunch, start with a simple but wholesome Brussels & Roots with a honey clove dressing. The vegetables are simply steamed- golden baby beetroots and baby turnips along with the Australian Brussels sprouts. The garden of greens is flavored with pops of umami from the slow-baked tomatoes seasoned with thyme, garlic, sea salt and olive oil.For lunch, go for a lighter Pan-Roasted Chilean Sea Bass. The fish is seared and basted with butter, then finished in the oven with a simple touch of salt, pepper, and lemon juice. A refreshing ratatouille adds a juicy crunch to the mix. We agreed with the chicken stock flavored polenta which was rich and velvety with some Parmesan sharpness.For dinner, the Firefly Squid ($24) surprised us with a bacon-like smokiness in the meatless cauliflower puree. I have no idea how but i'd take all the cauliflower puree as a guiltless replacement. The special firefly squid from Japan is intensely flavored, having been marinated overnight in soya sauce, sake, mirin and brown sugar. Definitely order the Octopus & Prawn ($24). This has to be one of the best (if not the best) Spanish octopus i've eaten this year. The octopus is simmered whole with mirepoix and other spices and white wine for 2 - 3 hours before grilling on a plancha. The crispy skin and that tender flesh were unforgettable.I didn't like the Fjord Trout ($19). I'm not sure if it's due to the way it's cooked- mi cuit style, sous vide with salt, but the flesh was mushy and powdery. The flavor was great, just not the texture. Fresh pasta are a must these days. If you like something really meaty, the Malbec Oxtail Pasta ($32) with a smoky Scamorza will satisfy. The oxtail is braised with Malbec (my favorite wine) to impart that berries, plum, and chocolate flavor. Perfect comfort food. Can i have another glass of Malbec to go with this please?A favorite at SPRMKT is the Smoked Lobster Tail ($42) which features a cold smoked and then seared Maine lobster with toasted garlic panko bread crumbs and a Mac n Cheese. The cheese sauce is a lot lighter than usual as they have added pumpkin puree to the Emmental, aged Parmesan, and Mozzarella mix. I absolutely love the Twice Cooked Chicken Roulade ($28). I've not had a chicken so good in a while. The juicy chicken thigh is brined overnight and then rolled with a creamy spinach and mushroom duxelle, before being cooked sous vide and then shallow fried for that amazing Peking-duck-like crispy skin. It's great on its own, with its own jus, or with the amazing curry cauliflower puree (seriously they are so good with their cauliflowers). I can go on forever about the other tender juicy red that is the Stockyard Côte de Boeuf ($94). This 200 days grain-fed 600g Australian bone-in beef ribs is good for 2. The ribs are first coated with a house made Creole spice rub before being seared and roasted. Drizzle a little of that beef jus made with roasted bones, red wine, tomatoes, and veal jus for some tart umami. The meat is served with mixed mushrooms, roasted rosemary tomatoes and vine-ripened tomatoes. Perfect date meal!End your meal with a fragrant and light Earl Grey Creme Brûlée ($16) scented with a lemon lavender streusel base and fresh seasonal fruits.For something rich and earthy, the Three Beet Chocolate Lava Cake ($18) delighted us with the medley of textures created with the versatile root. Of course, we cannot resist a 70% Valrhona dark chocolate lava cake. I wouldn't be surprised to see more of this beetroot and raspberry sorbet on the market. I'm already seeing a lot of beetroot on the menu of many noteworthy restaurants."

At first is a bit confusing, the name suggests a market, and they do sell a few (overpriced) fruits and vegetables, but it can also appear as a bakery, cafe, restaurant, takeaway or souvenir store. They seem to have a bit of everything.As a restaurant they have few tables outside where they serve an interesting menu. Ambitious might be the proper word to describe it. They have common dishes, mostly Western, but made with a slight, almost imperceptible, twist, mainly done by adding a touch of a different flavour, which lifts the plate. For example, the sweet potato fries come with a well-balanced curry mayonnaise. More importantly, the food I've had there a couple of times is done with care and precision. Prices seem rather high, but portions are on the generous side, so I think they're fair (it's Robertson Quay anyway). Burgers are big and delicious, and pasta is served in more than enough amounts. Mainstream beers are expensive at 10++ for a miserable half pint, but they have good craft beers at the same price for a bottle. Coffee is not bad, but nothing to rave about. Cakes are tasty, worth trying. An important thing is they make an effort in offering more local products rather than imports, maybe they could make that more explicit.Inside the shop, there are three tables that serve as a cafe, and there's a shelf that showcases souvenirs of the interesting kind, I'm talking about Singlish ""dictionaries"" and Teochew recipe books instead of Merlion keychains. While these quirky souvenirs are quickly becoming mainstream, they also sell books by Math Paper Press, which are truly good local gifts.SPRMKT has a little bit of many different things and, sometimes, it's not quite clear what to expect. It is, after all, a place to have a nice dining experience and find some amusing local products. It is worth a try, the food is better than it would seem."

However, we really enjoyed everything we ordered. The salad was ridiculously fresh with a good balance of cheese, capers, olive oil, and lemon. The grilled octopus was also very tender and flavorful. The fish was nice but a little on the dry side. We were tempted to try the fried Greek donuts and were glad we did. The six puffy yeast balls came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup and honey for dipping. It was not overly sweet or greasy. The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because the service was not as personable or friendly as one would expect for a typical cosy, charming establishment like this."

Once on a weekday, the other a weekend. There was an April only promotion - 50% off for 4 pax.My first visit, weekday lunch starts at 11am. So there were 3 of us and the promotion would not apply to us unless we bought a 4th pax and we would enjoy the 50%. The usual price was $48++ per person. And so we did as recommended by the manager.Peach Garden is located in the Amara Hotel in the Havelock area.. Parking here can be pricey if you come on a weekday. We parked some distance away off Chin Swee Road, in the residential area and took a short walk to the hotel.Once we sat down, we were promptly attended to. We ordered our tea and took a look at the menu. The promotion menu is on a piece of print out where one would be required to mark what we wanted.Our first dish was the deep fried Soon Hock (Grouper). The dish was excellent. Every part of the fish was edible, even the tail because it was so crispySoup: we ordered a mix of clear sharks fin broth & thicker version. Both were tastyAbalone & wasabi. This turned out a little disappointing. The salad was rather bland. There wasn't a key item for the eyes to feast on therefore killed the dish for me.Fried shrimp. Slightly oily but tasted great. Would've preferred lighter/less batterSpinach, tri-egg in broth. This dish is a must have.On my second visit being a weekend, there were 2-round seating, one being 11am, the other being 1pm. Therefore be aware you cannot sit leisurely for lunch.The menu had fewer soup items, and a few additional items. This time, the manager told me that the Soon Hock is not available. This was a huge disappointment because this time, we brought our grandmother who loves fish. And we had to order other fish dish.This time, everything was salty. The saltiest item we ordered was the spinach noodle in Mapo Tofu sauce. We returned it. What we ordered that we did not the other day were Indonesian curry shrimp. The shrimps were fresh. Flesh was tender. Curry base was tasty. Would've loved it better if some yew tiao were provided to soak up the sauce.Steamed PaTing fish, slightly fishy, but still quite good. sauce it was sitting in was good with rice.Herbal shrimp. This was so good, we each drank up all the herbal soup that the shrimps were sitting in.Deep fried fish skin. It was good but was a little soft by the time the skins were served.I would definitely come back again but will only do it when there's a promotion. Otherwise, it's just too expensive."

Most of the normal dim sum was on it. The most expensive item is the shark fin dumpling with abalone being S$20 per bowl. The rest of the items starts from S$5.80 onwards.Entrance from the car park goes directly into the dinning area. You have to make your way to the front to meet the maitre'd. Service after that was fast. The waitress asked which tea would we like but actually she only had one type, so why bother to asking? Chances of someone ordering the tea she carries is like 1 in 70 due to the number of tea combo there are. There were numerous occasions that the waitress brought us the wrong order, sure the restaurant was crowded but not full.We ordered the normal stuff, prawn dumplings, meat dumplings, chicken legs, steam pork rib, various buns, century egg and pork porridge, fried carrot cake and the $20 shark fin dumpling. Unfortunately the shark fin dumpling was not that good and does not worth the $20. The pork ribs was lean and so after steaming, it was really tough. The various prawn and meat dumplings was average. The char siew pow was above average and was the only item worth ordering. The century egg and lean pork porridge was rather expensive as it was like 7 spoons of porridge only. The carrot cake was also nice but it was $18 and comes with prawns.Overall the food is just average and it was rather expensive But hey this is a after all an hotel restaurant."

And yes, I was thrilled when I heard that we are going to try out the buffet here. On the lift, it has quite a few advertisements about the Laksa and some other foods but I did not really sink that in until I came to this cafe.Open concept dining - score. This so called cafe has also plenty of seats. Located on the 1st floor, you wouldn't probably miss this place. Was served by the waitress promptly to our seats. Like any other buffet style, I know that we can walk around and see the food first before getting the food. As a foodie, I took pictures of foods as well as the assigned chefs and update it on Yelp first. I started at the end corner where the international chef was serving ham and turkey. Got myself a honey baked ham. And there was other toppings for the turkey but I placed it on my ham instead. Took a couple of food types in small portions there and started circling the other stalls. I also took a piece of scallop. Like the ham and the scallop. Ham was soft and tasty while scallop has ingredients on it as well which produced flavorful taste.Next stall I went to was the Laksa store. After seeing the advertisement on the way to the buffet area, I was somehow imagining the taste and flavor just by looking at the ad. Yes yes!! My imagination and my tastebuds matched. A must try dish if you pop by here.Next station was the sushi station. Got myself quite colorful sushis (not sure about the names) but the difference are the ingredients. There was a sushi master cutting sashimi at that area too. Didn't really get it as I wanted to taste other foods. Sushi's rice wasn't well done and not as fresh as the seafood section.Next stop, soup station - clam chowder and piece of french baguette. Quite disappointed with the cold soup and cold french baguette. Was expecting it to be warm.Last of all, dessert! I tried most of the dessert for the day. There are two kinds of shots - raspberry and chocolate. Loved the raspberry one. The chocolate was too thick and I was expecting it to be like a chocolate mousse in the cup. The log cakes - chocolate: bitter and need to acquire the taste before indulging in more, fruity flavored: passionfruit mousse with shredded coconut was the perfect combination of all. Tried the raspberry mousse cake. Loved the texture and sour sweet taste in it. Ginger creme brûlée sounds weird but it was good but please avoid strawberry as it had caramel on it. Overall, I am very satisfied with the dessert section. There were ice creams with cones too at this dessert corner but was too full to gulp into more delicacies.Service was excellent - servers cleared the plate as soon as I placed my plate aside. Was quick in serving water when asked too. Overall, I am very satisfied with the buffet style in this cafe. Do try it when you are in the area!"
Cafe Brio’s,392 Havelock Road Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel lobby Singapore 169663 Singapore ,169663,1.29028193417518,103.835147954372,[],Li T.,dJzKwp5k65MK3R_qn4Xpow,"Singapore, Singapore",4,12/19/2014,"A giant 15 feet Christmas Tree greeted me when I stepped into the lobby. Making a detour around it, I spotted a familiar figure--Mr Santa--resting happily in the goodie house and surrounded by his old friends, Mr and Mrs Gingerbread Men. The cheery festive spirits at Grand Waterfront Copthorne Waterfront were highly infectious and they definitely pumped up my appetite to indulge in the Yuletide treats at Cafe Brio's. Here are FIVE REASONS why this is a great location to wine, dine and be merry!Reason No.1:SALADS I know most people would naturally dive straight into the oysters and sashimi but it would be a grave strategic error NOT giving their salads a chance. One never look at buffet salads the same way again after trying the tasty offerings such as juicy mushroom salad, fresh corns with lentil beans and even a ""heart-shaped"" Seafood salad constructed with lots of cured salmon cubes and cherry tomatoes for that bit of tart balance. And the deeply savoury Norwegion Smoked Salmon with horseradish cream? Yes, they are my salads too. Reason No. 2: LIVE STATIONWith hotels upping their ante to dish up fresh hot food ala minute, live stations are no longer a novel concept. But where in Singapore can one possibly have Australian meatballs at the Live Station?  And there's the famed superb Super Laksa here too. The fragrance of the coconut milk permeates the potent broth which is the key that makes it an arduous task to leave any drip behind. It must be a lot of hard work for the one-man chef who is tending the station; one hand busy boiling the noodles and the other hand cooking the tomato sauce. But fret not as the quality is highly assured. Reason No. 3: MEATSBuffet is always a game of chance where there are plenty of choices but the only way to sieve out the better ones is to try a little from each dish. One great thing is that Cafe Brio stocks up quite a few dishes for each meat category, which increases the probability of success. Take of example in my favorite fish category, there is Deep Fried Sichuan Fish, Atlantic Butter Cod, Fish Otah, Stewed Fish Maw, etc. What took my fancy was the Pan Fried Sea Bass that sat in a pool of creamy mushroom, scattered with pomegranate seeds that complemented the savoury dish splendidly. Reason No. 4: OUTDOOR GRILL Adjourn to the outdoor grill section where one gets different kinds of marinated meats hot of the grill. We tried the thinly-sliced beef whose juices are duly retained. Some options like the pre-grilled items like pork fillets or lamp chops resided in the buffet warmer but I think it's still best to go for those freshly grilled items.Reason No. 5: FRENCH DESSERTSAttention gravitates towards the dessert counter, where a spread of tantalizing treats created by award-winning Executive Pastry Chef Nicolas Maugard who has honed his skills at several Michelin-star establishments over his 17 years of pastry career. This year's highlight is the Vanilla Pineapple Roasted Confit, Coconut Biscuit, Mango and Yuzu log cake.  Don't wrong the cake if you couldn't detect any crunch as the ""Biscuit"" is not literally the biscuit, but a dacquoise layer that is saturated with fragrant coconut shreds. Each segment had its own sea of significance but they seemed to bumped corners with another in what seemed to be an arbitrary assemblage. The Raspberry flavoured Grand Marnier and ""Guanaja"" Chocolate Christmas Yule Log Cake is a comfortable partnership of flavours but I wished the Grand Marnier flavour could be more pronounced. Nonetheless, the texture of the chocolate mousse is astoundingly velvety, just like the excellent Panna Cotta which I had previously at Pontini. Freshly made on the spot, the golden waffles with crisp browned edges and a tender, not-too-sweet interior is also worth a spot in the limited stomach space. Highly flexible to go along with any savoury ingredients like smoked salmon or sweet creamy ice cream."

It was the hotel's signature and bestseller, Chocolate Truffle, and we were all impressed the simple, yet pretty presentation and the taste. There was a shiny ganache layer, with artfully placed berries. Digging into cake revealed two moist sponge layers sandwiched between light light chocolate mousse. Raisins could be found within the layers as well, adding a variety of textures. There was also an alcohol tinge to the cake, not sure if the sponge had been presoaked with rum, but it complemented the cake nicely. However, as with most mousse cakes, too much will lead to one feeling rather stuffed, especially with a strong flavour like chocolate."

There is local food such as satay outdoors, Japanese food, Western food and more depending on what is available on the day that you are there. I have been there a couple of times and am always glad for the choices. The food though is not exceptionally good but I think the hefty prices of $49 for Monday to Thursday nights and $59 for Friday to Sunday nights are paid mostly for the variety of dishes and ambience. One thing that is lacking though is the dessert options. There are perhaps about five choices and although the dessert changes from time to time, it is still quite limited.The ambience, as mentioned before, is the other thing you're paying for. The outdoor seating is near the river and makes for a serenely romantic backdrop for the evening, whether you are on a date or enjoying a meal with friends or family. In the cool evening breeze and the lovely setting, it is an ideal place to chat and eat a buffet meal slowly, in a relaxed fashion."

Everything was so beautiful. It was like eating little pieces of art. There were a lot more courses than listed on the menu.The flavors were very simple but their freshness made them distinct. I'm not going to describe every course since it would take forever. Plus the menu changes with the season so every time is a new experience. Instead, I'll just focus on the few dishes that impressed me.The bonito smoke with hay was my favorite. Bonito is a strong fish. The smoke lends itself well to the bonito without overpowering and creates a different texture.The maguro was magnificent. We were given the otoro and akami . The otoro is an overrated cut of the tuna. The akami is by far my favorite because it has more flavor and a better texture. Chef Yoshiyuki agrees.The kinmedai was very elegant. It's a type of snapper but fattier and more flavorful than a regular red snapper. Grilling was the perfect treatment for the kinmedai.The entire meal was beautiful but these dishes were great. Will RTE if possible."

Dessert was a wafer like ice cream and as a birthday treat, Japanese fruits and a Sakura mochi were presented. Yoshiyuki-San was very polite and quite friendly.

I've visited their outlet at terminal 3 before and surprisingly the food here seems a lot better! The only disappointment I have is that the portions can be larger for the price i paid.

Both were so good, and I loved every mouthful. The wonton mee is soft and smooth, the sauce not too salty and the wonton nicely cooked. The generous vegetables were a big plus. The sambal does not have much kick, though.The fishball noodles were slightly less salty, and the fish balls are bigger than others I have eaten- very soft and not chewy at all. I'll have it again next time!Their chicken rice is oiler than I like, so paying some extra cents and worth it, though, is their char siew chicken rice. My god, it is fantastic. The slices were a lovely red colour and moist, going perfectly with the aromatic white rice. Don't eat with the chilli sauce! It overpowers. The soup is excellent, one of the best I've had.The you tiao is something I will not miss. It's just too oily to the point I feel lipsticked with oil. Generally, the fried items are not so bad.Dig in- don't be bothered if its too much oil or salt. Ananas is just another reason to enjoy hawker food while it lasts. :)"

It's the de facto community art gallery of Ubin.Affectionately known as the ""two sisters"" coffee shop by regulars, the place is run by two sisters who were born and bred on the offshore island. An evidence of how well loved it is can be seen by the photographs that were all donated to the sisters by regulars that include many a professional photographers, and old timer islanders who have known the sisters since they were little. It doesn't get as authentic as this.Food wise, they serve up the usual ""chze char"" fare. The food is nothing to brag about but it's all in the service and homeliness of the coffeeshop that brings regulars back again and again.

Cozy Bistro & Lounge is equipped with, Pool Table x 01, Darts machines x 02 and Telecast soccer match on TV. Nestled in the Jalan Lokam residential neighbourhood, it is within reach of Bartley or Serangoon MRT stations.1. Crispy Prawn Twister 12.80- Served with celery and carrot sticks with tartar sauce. Probably one of my favourite snacks to munch on while darting. Definitely a fun way to eat your favourite fried prawns! Crispy and tasty!2. Lamb Rack $23.80 *Highly Recommended*- 3 bone premium lamb rack cooked together with garlic and lemongrass presented with green salad and stirred-fried potato; complemented with red wine brown sauce. This is probably why I would come back! The lamb rack was so juicy and tender. One bite and you'll be sold. A good mix of meat and fats, with some light seasoning, makes this so irresistible.  It was melt in your mouth delicious.4. Roast Beef (Pre-order only) $88.00The roast beef was very thickly sliced and cooked to a perfect medium; it was salty, meaty goodness. Sides were also good: salad with dressing was good and oven baked potato. - 600gms Roast beef cooked to order. Presented with garden green salad and oven baked potato complemented with black pepper brown sauce.6. German Pork Knuckle (Pre-order only) $55.80- ""Chef Specialty"" presented with garden green salad, homemade mash potato and thai chilli sauce. Crispy on the outside pork knuckle skin and juicy and meaty on the inside. This is great for a party of 4 or more! It's huge! The homemade mash potato was a nice discovery, it was flavourful and savoury. I would definitely consider ordering this for a cool boys night out!Other dishes such as the Mushroom Aglio Olio was a tad spicy for me and tasted slightly bland for my taste. But again here, Cozy Bistroy & Lounge is extremely generous with the amount of mushrooms served!There is a current promo for CarlsBerg Beer $60.00 for a Tower or $25.00 for a Jug.Overall : Do stop by Cozy Bistro & Lounge for a fun night out without hurting your wallet! Prices are nett and you have gotta try the Lamb Rack $23.80,   German Pork Knuckle (Pre-order only) $55.80 and Crispy Egg Seafood Noodles $10.80."

That said, it was competently done with thin skin and crunchy shrimp filling. Siew Mai - same feedback as the Har Gow. Malay cake - fluffy soft and not too sweet. Wu Kok with Chili crab filling - interesting.

He is quite friendly and offered to pick the sauces to be mixed and I gladly accepted. I don't know how to describe the dish but it has a lot of ingredients.

I love to have my lor mee with the thick bee hoon and lots of chilli, vinegar and garlic.The aunty has a pleasant personality and even though i requested for a lot of things she didn't seem to be angry at all, some stall folks would get angry as it is different from the usual order.

There is a particular Nasi Lemak stall called Yi Liu Xiang that is an old time favourite of mine. They have such awesome chili and ikan bilis that I can just eat the rice with those two ingredients alone.Parking is pretty readily available in the adjoining multi-storey carpark.

Parking is plentiful (depends on timing though) and an easy walk from Kovan mrt and bus station. I love the soup which is very tasty, and full of vegetables. The small is sufficient for 2 persons. I find the cheaper fish (garoupa?) has more bones than the pomfret, but it is more flavorful. It also has slices of yam in the soup. The prawn paste chicken wings is a must order. Just so yummy. Sambal sweet potato leaves are equally good."

I normally frequent the tian wai tian at ang mo kio, but since I was going bowling at jForte my friends decided to grab dinner here on a rainy sunday night.At around 730pm, the place was packed. there was a queue to place zichar orders. All the tables were occupied and you would've to wait quite a while for an empty table. Even when we got a table, it took another 10-20 minutes before the table got cleared and cleaned. My recommendation is make a reservation, so that you have a clean table and the reserved tables are on the other side of the coffee shop which is more airy and windy. I say at the side facing the bus interchange, there wasn't much air crossflow.1. Fish head steamboatWe ordered a medium and my friends complained that they coudln't find much fish in the steamboat. There were 5 of us and yes some pieces were miniscule and some were half the size of an iphone 6S. The fish was decent, it wasn't MSG ladden as I didn't feel too thirsty after the meal. The soup was served with vegetables and seaweed. I loved the seasweed. The soup was refillable, but it is self-service.2. Prawn Paste ChickenTheir prawn paste chicken never fail to meet my expectations. I love them! They are so crispy on the exterior and juicy and tender on the inside. They aren't too oily but they sure are sinful! The chicken wings are also pretty plump. 3. Egg FuyongThe egg was pretty oily but they were generous with the ingredients, lots of prawns, carrots and some meat in the egg. The aroma of the egg was pleasant and even though we ordered a small portion, it was more than enough for the 5 of us. 4. Salted egg porkThis was the only disappointing dish we ordered. The pork was dry and I could barely taste the salted egg. The salted egg was also barely visible on the pork. Skip this dish5. Sambal Kang KongThis was drenched in oil! I ended up washing the kang kong in a bowl of fish soup before eating it as there was just too much sambal oil on the vegetables.For 5 of us, we paid $79, at $16 per pax, our tummies are filled with zi char food and we were all satisfied. But I'll definitely go for sweet and sour pork rather than salted egg pork the next time round.Overall : don't expect any service, since you're not pay any service charge or GST, make a reservation before heading down, and do give the fish head steamboat a try."

Oh man, it definitely hit the spot.  For the ribs, they were literally tender fall off the bone, the way real ribs are intended.  For Roasted Cauliflower, never was really a fan before, but after trying this for the first time it opened my world and now i'm try to figure out how can i make this at home. Once you try it, you'll know why. The ambience is more of an informal bar type setting. It's great for casual eating with friends but not so much a date spot.

I came with another friend to try the Hokkien Mee here. It took a while (at least 10 mins) for it to be ready and we ordered right when it opened (we got there before 10 am, and waited for it to open). So I do not know how long it will take if you order during peak period. The noodle was tasty. It was not too wet or dry. My friend said she could smell the prawn stock wafting from the plate. I liked it but I was not overly wowed. Maybe no lard (or not enough lard) -- I could not remember if it was there. It lacked the umami or rich taste of a nicely fried Hokkien Mee with plenty of wok hei flavor. Still, it is a good place to try.

My father will usually Da Bao a pack of 10 piece of meatball for my brother for snack. They are really tasty despite being on the oily side.What I don't like about the stall is that the noodles portion are really little, and most of the time I won't be full after eating.

(Brunch dishes - they're just eggs y'all!) I suppose when youngsters (and older, aka me) started turning up at cafes in droves with their laptops and staying for hours.At least with Regroup, I didn't feel too bad parting with $17 for my squid ink linguine (4 stars). For starters, it had soft shell crab in it. While the crab wasn't as delicately crispy as others I've had, the garlicky, spicy sauce was right up my alley. Typically, I feel like I order squid ink pasta more for its unique colour (I'm a sucker for green tea and pistachio flavoured items because of their gorgeous colours. Heck, I swear it was the wildly unnatural, beautiful lilac skins of yam baos [taro buns] that conned me into consuming far more of them than is probably advisable). But this time, the linguine itself seemed to be that much more flavourful. Warning: Don't eat this before an important presentation or risk looking like a toothless pirate.Tried some of my friend's truffle mushroom soup (4 stars) - it didn't taste creamy and wasn't salty. She found it a bit bland though. Also had some of her goldrush waffle (4 stars). The waffle was somewhere nicely between being soft and crispy, the dark chocolate ice cream was solid, and the honeycomb crumbs were a nice touch. The salted egg sauce was good, but it's not my thing to begin with. I had a single scoop of ice cream and the girl at the counter very nicely agreed to do 2 generous half scoops for me, making it $4 well-spent. Their pistachio (4 stars) is definitely one of the better ones I've had. The stout butterbeer (3.5 stars) had a good flavour but melted too quickly.Besides the food, I love the decor of the place (5 stars). It's spacious, brightly lit, and minimalist. They also have 3 fans going in addition to the air-conditioning - I'm guessing because the large windows make it fairly warm in the day. It was pretty empty on a weekday afternoon, and I got some studying done. Note that there's no wifi available. I see their pistachio latte, smoked salmon salad, and a good book making a perfect afternoon in my near future."

They do latte art. Flavour wise, it's on the safe side and even slightly on the bland side. But the nearest decent coffee at a walk is Wheeler's Yard but that place you'll probably have a much longer wait albeit tastier cup. 3.5 for the coffee.Waffles take quite a prominent spot on the menu but we were in the mood for some salt so we ordered the truffle fries. I have to say the fries were not very good. Firstly they are thick cut but more importantly the oil seemed a little over-used and the insides weren't fluffy..like the fries were a little old. Simple dish that a lot of places sell and make good margins on, so it was an unpleasant surprise that it was subpar.I do like the atmosphere of the place. It's laidback. Kudos for the cool stylish tap for getting your own water. Other than that, it doesn't stand out that much. It doesn't have the charm of the Duxton flagship I would say.I was there on a Sunday morning before 11am and the place was nearly empty.They don't have parking so maybe it appeals more to residents. I have a friend who stays round the corner and I actually drive by weekly but the fact is, I've only been in once..so that is saying something. If I need a coffee and can be fussed to park at my friend's condo and walk. But if I were gonna drive to drink and I'm not crunched for time, I would head over to Old Hen for a bit more life and vibe and taste.Icecream here is rich and sweet. Some almost too sweet for my taste but it's quite creamy and should please be a crowd pleaser. I'll try the waffles when I come back next time and see if it warrants an update!"

I'm enjoying a morning breeze on a idyllic Sunday morning with my loved ones.I ordered a Farmer's Platter and a ice cold Mocha for myself and a traditional Egg Benedict for my wife. The Farmer's Platter had a good mixture of meat (bacon, European Sausages and beef patty) and a good albeit small toast plus a nice serving of mushroom ragout! Overall, the food was good but the beef patty could have been a little overdone. Maybe next time I would ask for the beef patty to be not overdone. The mushroom ragout was good! Slightly creamy and mushroom was just nice and soft. The Traditional Egg Benedict has a nice poached egg on top of the English Muffin. When sliced, the egg yolk was flowing down on to the muffin and it made it looked even yummier. I would recommend this place due to the sea front setting and especially when there is a cool breeze blowing towards you. Ask for the outside seats, you will not regret!"

Half an hour after one cocktail comes in, the waitstaff will tell you that there isn't the other drink you've requested for. Iced water arrives about an hour after you're seated and should you have an extra friend come in mid way, then it's too bad. You're going to have an extra serving plate and cutlery 15 minutes before you finish your meal. But not before you request for the same items four times and then resignedly nick it off another table. Food is just ok. Sure, the crabmeat linguine is good. But Italian isn't really that complicated to execute. The Buffala pizza came drowned in cheese, so much so that the cheese pooled bathtub-like at the base, leaving the edges dry painted with tomato. The mushroom fettucine was reported to be unfresh, and the sauce gritty because the fungi hadn't been washed properly. On the upside, the ambience is nice. And especially romantic if you're looking out to the sea. Although.. While I was there, there was fighting at the nearby construction site. Which kind of adds to an ambience of a different kind. Gritty romance anyone?"

We ordered the unagi and foi gras appetizer and quickly discovered that the pairing did not work well. The entree we did manage to get was the duck confit and, although judged premade (due to the speed in which it was served), the taste was fine.

The drink was bottle version, available off the shelf.Ordered the dry version of the noodle and it was pretty disappointing. The noodles was lumpy and had quite strong alkaline taste from the lye water. Pretty washing the noodles in the small broth that served with the noodle, but only slight improvement. The wantons were slightly more salty than preferred. Overall it was a terrible dish which was pretty different from the usual dish which was served in other outlets.Deep-Fried Mango Prawn Roll (S$3.20++/ 2pices)Although this dim sum could be found in other outlets but the version was very different from other outlets. The version here was full of mayonnaise but barely able to taste the mango in it. I would prefer the version from Crystal Jade Dining In which was full of chucky mango.Assorted Trio Har Kau (S$4.80++/ 3 pieces)The dim sum looked pretty colourful in red, orange and yellow and tasted not bad with the skin not too thick.Overall it was a disappointing meal.

If you are not already  familiar with them, they have 3 different dining experience, the so-called Nihon Mura Izakaya, Mihon Mura Bento Sushi and the one here, fits the Kaiten Sushi notion - conveyer belt sushi. I rarely visit any of the outlets but last week, I decided to give it a try, after all, I need to find a place for my dinner and trying to skip ALL Chinese/French foods!!  So, this one here, seems to fit the bill - a quieter dining room plus its a Japanese fare!I guess the draw is - the affordable price tag plus that promotion currently rolling out. The colour plates are going for $1 each if you ordered 3s. But strangely, they don't seem to fill up the conveyer belt, nothing has been replenished and the moving platform looks empty and cold. Weaned me from wanting to eat more, I should be happy for the reduced appetite, but at the very least, please refill the belt to make the dining room looks more ""normal"" when you called it ""Kaiten Sushi"" eatery. It appeared so pathetic and everyone will have to take the hassle to order from the menu, manually. Defeat the idea totally.If you asked, let's do a quick honest review.. before I lost that inspiration again (btw, I have always been truthful lol).The usual pick, Inari sushi - nice and soft cooked vinegar rice  plump up the fried Tofu pouch like a coin-filled money sac. These tofu skin has a subtle sweetness in them, not overly candied and it was moist and cushy. I always opt for plain ones, to get a real taste of the basics. I hardly give chance to one that are stuffed with fanciful kani or  Salmon roe.. a simple good Inari sushi is one that will make my day. And these, yes, they did somehow ... plus its a dollar for 2!? A steal.. if you are not fussy over anything.The Chawanmushi is passable though I find the taste in the custard a little too harsh in the seasoning. I like the egg custard to arrive on my table, having a balanced flavour. The mirin was found domineering the poor soy sauce fella, I didn't quite understand the sweet egg dish in the tea cup though the chicken chunks were juicy and tender. I won't need a sweet dessert in between my mains..  The chilled soba was the worst I ever tasted. The one here, served in a bamboo tray was far from meh = Meh meh meh!! AVOID!!  It looks weirdly painted in some sort of a alien green, I hope I am not loading myself with chemical paints but the critical part is, the noodle was hard, I can't match it up with the proper ""al dente"" term, it wasn't any close. However, I am glad that  I have less to complain on the tsuyu dipping sauce.To make it up, the Ebi and Yasai Tempura was some fresh vegetables, mostly root plants with 3 shrimps. The lotus root tempura was the most chewy and stoned, while the rest was causing less exhaustion on my jaw-muscles. They were fresh but less crisp on the fried batter. $6.90 for that stack was reasonable, given the ""teaspoon-length"" shrimps. Then I went on to order a plate of Sakura Ebi Age Maki, again this fall under the $1 promotion. Never mind about the  micro-tag, it won't influence my review anyhow =) I wished this fried maki has been perfect, the light batter turn out having a loud greasiness in each bite. The honeyed Sakura Ebi wasn't entirely inferior in taste, the way it looked. The maki has a mixture of  some Kani, Tamagoyaki morsels, seaweeds - very flavourful except the less favourable greasy exterior. Maybe they should properly drained them or use a blotting tissue to fight the stubborn diesel?!!? I will have a hard time considering if the plate was to cost me $3.48 at its usual. $1 for that, I will have to try to digest with a faint smile then...It's probably a good place for a weekend family session, if you are not particularly coming for the authentic flavours. The tags are smaller than most Japanese sushi outlet but think twice for those who can't accept misfired items."

Teh also just so-soIt was quite cheap and really much more reasonable than the rip-off Teochew porridge just down the road.They also sell porridge in the same stall too though.

There's always a long queue out the front, so despite the inconvenience of getting there, I made a trip down to check it out.The curry chicken wing was tender but somewhat bland, so I didn't really like that. The pork chops were a little dry, but it was pretty tasty. I liked the cabbage, and stewed fatty pork. They were both perfectly cooked till there was a nice balance between the tenderness and chewiness. The minced pork ball was probably the best item I ordered. It's firm and springy as you bite into it, and very juicy. Full marks for flavours and texture, none for presentation though! There are also a lot of other things to choose from, but that's all I ordered. It's open from 6pm till 5am in the morning. There's a queue even at midnight! But don't worry, they are really fast and efficient. The queue moves quickly.It's located in its own kopitiam space, so lots of space for seating. Parking in that area isn't too bad later at night, but if you're going earlier, you may have to park further away and walk over."

The wasabi that came with the sushi was also pretty tasteless and not as 'spicy' as it is supposed to taste like.My friends had actually ordered other dishes like their chawamushi and bento sets but all were of average standards and we were actually paying for restaurant standards, really not worth any cent of it.

I've always been a huge fan of conveyor belt, 100jpy/$1 sushi.. and today was the opening promotion for the Seletar Mall sushi express. Located on the second floor, behind the escalator, the restaurant has a strange layout, in which they fully maximize the shop space with every seat facing the conveyor belt. It might look a bit claustrophobic, as I had initially thought it was.. but after awhile, you are so consumed by the sushi going around you, that you completely forget that the shoulder of the next person beside you is literally inches away from you.Nonetheless, the sushi was fresh! Thick salmon sashimi slices, ikura gunkan, jellyfish, you name it! To be honest, I haven't really had a lot of experience with high end sushi, but hey,.. if the sashimi melts in your mouth like it did when I was in Japan, it works for me too! I really liked the sweet shishamo fish, can't tell if it came out of a can or not, but hey.. 3 pieces of pregnant fish for $1++ works for me :D it's kinda sweet, so hot green tea came in handy!Green tea is free, unlike nihon mura .. so.. wash down all that omega 3, protein fish with hot green tea, the hot water dispenser is available every 2 or 3 seats, so you're never more than an arms' length away from getting hot water. Desserts, there's a variety of desserts, like pudding, cheesecake, cream puffs, chocolate cakes, mochi.. and even collagen jelly packet drinks! I didn't have stomach space to try their desserts, but definitely wanted to try their pudding in the cup, which had what looked like blueberry jam on top of the pudding.. or maybe it was yogurt? I don't know, it was readily available,  I watched it circle the conveyor belt once, and it was never replenished, but I was also too distracted looking at salmon slices floating around too.."

A plate of lettuce come together with the Chicken and you may wrap the chicken in lettuce.

NOT mind-blowing or mouthwatering.My friend ordered a Plum beverage of some kind aka Ampla Juice ($4.95) while I opt for a Root Beer beverage that evening.  Thankfully Penang Culture is Halal Certified by the MUIS.I may return to another location of Penang Culture and perhaps order some other items in their Menu in which I want to try.  Perhaps from there, my review might differ.Yet another establishment that DO NOT ALLOW separate checks when time to settle the payment.  *DOUBLE SIGH*Penang Culture at White Sands is opened DAILY from 11:00 - 22:00hrs.Penang Culture @ White Sands Pasir Ris1 Pasir Ris Central Street 3,#03-21, White Sands Shopping MallSingapore 518457Tel: 6585 4877gdgroup.com.sg/penang-cu…"

The sides they offer are pretty decent as well, but be careful to not over order, as I have a tendency to do so. 2 large pizzas are really filling and can easily be shared by a group of 4 or more.

I love their mashed potato and Cajun fries in particular. They are more spiced and flavored as compared to those sold at other fast food chains that either taste too salty or too pepperish. A variety of burgers are also available here if you do not fancy chicken.One thing that I do need to point out is that there are several schools around Downtown East, so it tends to get crowded with schooling people on weekdays."

Traditionally, salted fish is added in for a smoked fragrant. It might look intimidating to some because it looks like a piece of stale meat. The claypot rice is really good! The chicken & chinese sausage portion is generous, in comparison, the few strands of choy sim on top of it looks pathetic. Anyway i think its for plating purpose. If you would like to add more vegs, they have many choices on their menu. We had nai bai with fried enoki, tofu with prawn & salted veg duck soup. The veg & tofu are ok.. I didnt like the salted veg duck soup. Its too salty for me & doesnt go well with the rice. It should go well with plain rice. There isnt a crowd during lunch.

On its own or with pasta. And cheaper than other restaurants. Often there are interesting daily specials. I also order takeaway puccia. It's their inhouse made bread stuffed with cold cuts, tomatoes, tuna and chilli. I don't usually go for canned tuna but this combination just works, helps that it's served hot and crops. In fact we often order this to share and have there with other mains as it comes cut into 4 full pieces. Small selection of deserts but the tarts are always good. Only one negative.

Service and decor is good. I ordered the special pasta and it was delicious!! My husband got the lasagna and it wasn't hot enough in the middle, I think they didn't heat it up enough so the outside was really hot but the inside was cold. This and the fact that they served water in plastic glasses is what made me drop 2 stars. Other than that the seem to have a good happy hour deal so I might be back for that."

We tried a variety of things, from their porridge, to chili crab pasta, spam fries, big breakfast etc. Nothing spectacular. For an iced coffee that costs $6, it came in a plastic takeout cup.

The manager and server FIfi are a service team of a calibre we haven't seen anywhere else in Singapore in our two years of eating our way around the red dot. The rest of the staff however are not very useful so if you pick a night when the manager is off duty it will not be the same. The food quality is good. It's casual Italian bistro food with good pizza options, pastas and salads. They do fresh juice juice and they do have a wine list though it could use a little help from someone who knows their wine. The day time scene is very different, they convert the restaurant into a cafeteria style place where you line up and dishes arrive at tables at random.

He took my order of Salad Prawns (which price was indicated as SGD15.00 on their online website).When I picked up my order of prawns, the restaurant charged me SGD42.80 (not including GST yet) for 1 order of Salad Prawns. I was flabbergasted as it was thrice the price that was listed online! When I questioned Ah Leong, he claimed that the price indicated online was meant for the Ang Mo Kio branch and that the prawns used at River Valley was far superior than that used in AMK, thus costing thrice the price.He was very aggressive and said that if I could not afford it, I could request for a refund and was extremely vocal about it, attracting attention from other customers. I was embarrassed, paid and left in a huff.I was surprised yet again when I returned home and opened my box of prawns because there were only 5 pieces of prawns, each no more the length of my little finger, coated with layers of flour. That means that each prawn costs about SGD9.00.

We had half roasted and half boiled Hainanese chicken. Both was nice with moist succulent chicken meat, but the roasted had a slight crispy skin. But if I was to choose a favourite then it has to be the boiled version.Although Boon Tong Kee is popular for their Hainanese chicken, I found there are many other dishes that are also nice. One of these dish is the crispy cereal prawns and one I do recommend to order. The prawns were massive and were definitely jumbo prawn. It was messy to eat but it was delicious.

So, do be careful when you order and check the prices so you know what you are getting yourself into!  That said, my everyone was very happy about the chicken rice."

I was quite happy with the quality of the rice here, but i would have to give a slight edge to Tian Tian, who's rice is slightly more fragrant and has better texture as well.other factors - no chicken innards is a ""no good"" from me. the place is air conditioned which is a huge plus relative to typical hawker center fare."

The poached chicken is typically juicy, though if like me you don't fancy a super strong chicken flavor, the chicken breast is better - ask for only that. BTK's rice is great, full of flavor and with a hint of pandan that makes it quite special. The real gem are the sauces - BTK's trademark red chili sauce and the sweeter brown (Hoisin?) as also the fresh ginger paste make for the magical Singapore chicken rice taste - each on its own, or in any combination with the chicken and the rice! Yes, freely mix n match what is on your plate - for an equally delightful result do what you may!It is the average service, erratic stocking of even chicken, and a mediocre set of alternatives that take away a star from this rating.

The white chicken tastes good, with their potent chilies. What a pity that this restaurant does not serve chicken rice soup, which is complementary in other chicken rice stalls & restaurants. You would have known that their mini fried tofu that comes with wasabi sauce is great like a snack or side dish. Another dish that I like over here is the spinach with 3 different types of eggs. I would say they have a not too bad rendition of this dish that I really like. Apart from the queueing at times and sharing of tables, I wouldn't mind coming here more for my dinner fix. ;)"

How scared?- Like being in a demonic nightmare you can't awake from- Like jumping out of a plane only to realise you forgot to take the parachute- Like being chased by a hungry cheetah and you're wearing thongs(In Oz we call this being sh!t scared! OR wearing the brown underpants!)Why am I scared? It all stems from my youth, when as a horrible child I got up to all sorts of mischief, which resulted in being disciplined (on the knuckles initially), by my mother - using a long wooden spoon. My naughty nature was such that she got so adept at using the thing she could hit me with it from another room, around walls, and over her shoulder without looking.So why bring all this up? Well... back in the day my mother lived in Singapore, and one of the dishes she brought back to Australia was char kway teow. It remains one of her favourite dishes to this day. Now I have grown up on her version of this dish, and totally loved it for years myself, so upon coming to Singapore I was interested in seeing how authentic her version was and if I found one better would I once again incur the wrath of the wooden spoon?Cue: No. 18 Zion Road Char Kway TeowThis was also my first hawker centre visit, so I was interested in the concept itself.Upon arriving I walked past endless stalls which only had 1 or 2 customers lining up for their food until I arrived at stall 18. Kaboom, a good 15-20 people lining up. Had I timed my run too late? I knew that it was closing at 3pm, and I'd gotten here at 2:10pm thinking I'd have enough time... As the line slowly progressed that time was running out, but then as if like magic, a big pile of orders were delivered at once and I was served probably 20-30 minutes after getting into the line (maybe quicker).The serving sizes are Small ($3.50 used to be $3), Medium ($4) and Large ($5).The glutton in me will pick the largest size 9 times out of 10 but I decided to be pragmatic here and opted eventually for the medium size.It was the right choice. The medium is a big enough serve for a hungry man, and given that char kway teow is quite heavy on the calories it's probably the best one to go for in terms of bang-for-your-buck-and-keeping-healthy balance.What I really loved seeing, when it was finally my time to order, was a photo of the cook/owner stuck alongside his grill. It had to be from 25-30 years ago. And for him to still be doing this, and churning out the same dish endlessly shows a real passion for the product.When I had the dish in my hands I made my way to a spare table in the centre and took a seat. Whilst I let the aroma of the dish invade my nostrils, the upbeat crappy but totally catchy Ronan Keating played over the speakers, followed by Owl City. I think it was important to mention this, because you feel good here. You feel somewhat light-hearted, and I think that is a great feeling to have on a weekend after work, just a carefree sort of afternoon with a nice meal.So what's the verdict Dan? Was it better than your mums? Here's the stickler. I'm loathe to say it was, for fear of that wooden spoon (or even never having the dish again) - but it was somewhat different in both flavour and texture.18 Zion introduce a generous amount of fresh cockles into the dish, and these juicy sweet bursts of flavour really cut through the richness of the dish, which I think is important as it can be quite rich. The pork lard crackling is an element I have never had before and it is exceptional, when you bite into one of those crunchy croutons of bacon-ness you are transported to flavour town.They also use a much darker thicker sauce, and the lap cheong whilst prevalent is diced much smaller than I'm used to - in such a way that it incorporates into the dish and is not something you identify separately - which is a key difference because it really rounds out the flavours.I loved this dish it was so flavourful and it is easy to see why it is considered one of Singapore's best exponents of CKT. However, I am also mindful that a dish like this is calorific - CKT sits at #6 for most calories in Singapore's Top 50 hawker foods with a whopping 745 calories based on a standard plating size - That's close enough to 3 Big Macs (257 cals each) to put it in perspective. If CKT wasn't so heavy on the calories I'd probably eat here very often."

Mr Ho's attention to detail is second to none.  I had the privilege of being the first person in the queue, and I watched for 15 mins as he made final preparations before they opened.  Adjusting where the eggs would be, where the noodles would be, the angle of his stock pot.  And then the final moment, when he dons his cap (backwards) and then turns on the light to the stall.  We're open!A little known fact that might miss a few.  Being first in line has it privileges.  One of them being, whilst the rest of the stall is being prepared, in the wok is actually a whole wok-full of lard being fried.  And so that first batch of kway teow, amazing!"

With this said, I truly enjoyed this meal.  Obviously one does not come to an establishment expecting large portions but his made me cherish every biteAs is typical, I was challenged to make my selections because everything looked so good.I started with the roasted eggplant and red pepper soup which was quite good. However, I have a feeling the classic French onion would have been a better selection.For my main course I selected the wagyu tenderloin topped with pan fried foie gras (which melted in my mouth with every bite). My largest disappointment comes in what I did not order. After eating I realized there was one more item in the specials that I'm sure would have been excellent. It is white asparagus season and it is flown in fresh in from France - I love white asparagus!For dessert I chose crème brûlée which was also quite good.  My only critique is that the serving was quite thin.  As a result, the sugar overpowered the very tasty vanilla creme. The same portion size would have been fine had it  been in a smaller but deeper serving cup."

Outstanding was the gravlax. Unfortunately it's not always available. The escargot was a disappointment with bits of grit. The mains were all very good. Best was the confit of suckling pig belly. Which was crisp and meltingly tender. Again preorder if you want this as this sells out fast. We finished with a brace of desserts, all well done. Overall a very nice dinner.

So I would gladly eat the one here again.Daily special of butter poached pink trout - so so good. the trout is deboned and so succulent and tender. Perfectly cooked and not dry. Add the french beans and toasted almonds, it has a wonderful combination of taste and bite. Love this dish!Daily special of mussels in white wine sauce - the white wine sauce is great, very flavorful and a good amount of wine taste, garlic and many other goodies.

There were dim sum with chicken and shrimp so I did not have to miss out because of pork. The Japanese area was my favorite: tofu hijiki salad, cold soba and udon, dashimaki tamago, and then...behold....rice with toppings and ONSEN TAMAGO!

The portion was very small and I guess was meant for one instead of two.  I did enjoy the salad and it was very good.  We followed that with the miso chicken, sesame togarashi and shishito peppers and the steamed atlantic cod, prawns, clams, kaffir lime leaves. Both dishes were amazing as everything melted in our mouths.  Truly well done.The second night, my family and I ordered lobster and pork chops for four to share.  Both items were cooked to perfection and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The shared lobster also came with two sides which we asked for garlic mashed potatoes and Wild Mushroom sides.  I must admit it was an excellent meal.As for service, it was very attentive and professional.  I thoroughly enjoyed the service by a specific waiter.  I did not get his name but he was a taller stocky fellow who made excellent recommendations.  I would not give them five stars but they were definitely headed in that direction.  A great special events location."

I adore their Sunday brunch with its freshly shucked oysters and meat grilled to perfection, and its martini bar where the alcohol was poured into an ice sculpture where it traveled before reaching the glass so as to keep it chilled. I am not sure if this is a standard feature every Sunday or just that time. Pretty cool to watch even if you don't drink. Food is fresh and service is attentive. I also love its lunches. It has become my new favorite place for a relaxing bite in the afternoon. Besides the a la carte dishes, you could do the mezze lunch - appetizers and dessert buffet (small but comprehensive) or with a choice of mains. The main portion is not huge so it is quite a good addition if you want more meat or seafood in your meal. The staff check on the buffet selection very often so it is replenished very quickly.The Buffalo mozzarella with fresh tomatoes are awesome, likewise for the salmon dish (don't remember the name) where the salmon is so tender it can melt in your mouth.

This latest instalment features a main course and buffet spread of appetizers and desserts at an unbelievable price of only $58++!! Buffet sounds highly inviting but the showpiece is the main course that comprises a selection of wood-fired steaks and seafood, grilled over apple wood at more than 200 degrees Celsius in temperature. Some of the mains require additional charges but they are very worth the extra bucks. Take for example the Rack of Lamb from Australia that truly exemplifies the skills of Chef Owen who is a master at handling tricky cuts. The marinade is nothing fancy, but the meat is superbly succulent and tender, as if I was slicing a raw eggplant.The pastry team seems to know the cacao bean very well as the chocolate treats were clearly the jewels of the dessert table. They were so decadent that one would be forgiving towards the slightly chewy over-chewy macarons. Sparkling like a bar of gold, the well-tempered Chocolate Yuzu Tart doesn't hit one in the face with a sharp citrus taste but it crawls in gradually towards the centre of the tart. There is a gorgeous dark chocolate ganache cake topped with raspberries but it could not surpass the supremacy of the Hazelnut Royaltine. This signature cake of Four Seasons lives up to its reputation with a satisfyingly thick and crunchy feuilettine. Probably a seasonal Italian inspiration, the ""chocolate salami"" is another dessert snack with its rewarding crumbliness and incorporation of salt that cuts through the cookie beautifully. Even ""mainstream"" desserts such as mixed berry crumble with buttery rocky-road chunks or the cloud-like bitter Chocolate pot de Crème stood notches above the rest. At a very reasonal price of $58, the Mezze dinner here goes beyond the sophisticated meal experience by creating a very welcoming, intimate ambience as if one is dining at home without feeling rushed or disturbed by loud, noisy conversations. Located just right next to the kitchen is the Chef Table which can seat up to 14 guests, making it a highly suitable option to host gatherings with your family and friends. But ultimately, it's all about the food. Driven by the philosophy of freshness and seasonality, there is of course one big catch: the menu changes all the time, so the yummy lobsters or chocolate yuzu tart might not appear on the buffet table on your visit. No worries, everything here is first rate."

We also ordered Tajima wagyu steak which was from their 'wood-burning grill'. It was fantastic, because I love the taste of steaks when they are slightly burnt from the grilling.
