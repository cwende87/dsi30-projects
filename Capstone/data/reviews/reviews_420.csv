Nakhon Kitchen,527 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 Singapore 560527 Singapore ,560527,1.37277209302753,103.854457955288,[],Melissa Y.,H8mXfh5XgGCqmMLwVH7k5A,"Singapore, Singapore",2,6/28/2015,"I've driven by this place several times and seen the queues on the weekends. I tried to make a telephone reservation only to be told, ""Just come and queue la, about 20 minutes can get table.."" So on the day before Father's day I came down to queue, I reached about 7pm and true enough, I was told the waiting time was about 20 minutes. In line, you are handed a menu to pick the dishes you want after which a staff will come to pen down your order whilst you wait for your table.The dining area is non air conditioned, but it can be quite airy during the evenings. After we were ushered to our seat, within a few minutes, our dishes started arriving one by one. I guess that's the plus point of ordering, while you're waiting in line!1. Chicken in Pandan Leaf $6I had high hopes for this dish, as I had seen several tables order this and I miss eating this in Thailand.The sauce was sweet and not spicy, the chicken smelt so good, I couldn't wait to tuck in!After I had unwrapped the leaf, I realized that it wasn't one piece of chicken. It looked like chunks of chicken meat with some flour/doughy filler to ""glue"" the pieces of chicken together. Definitely not what I was expecting to eat, and probably a ""cost-cutting"" technique they use. The meat was well seasoned but the flour in between the meat threw me off!2. Beef Kway Teow Soup $4Having eaten at Jai Thai many times and loving their beef kway teow soup, I decided to try the same dish here. Another disappointment as the beef here are just tiny strings of minced beef, rather than actual beef cubes. For the same price, and air conditioning, I would rather eat at clover way. The soup was abit bland and needed some more seasoning as well.3. Pad Thai $4My personal favourite dish and this restaurant's saving grace. Cooked exactly the same way I had eaten at a wet market in Pattaya, the wok hei here was spot on! Yes it was drenched in oil, but the flavours of this dish is so good, I didn't mind the extra calories. This is a must order at Nakhon!4. Olive Fried Rice $6The portion here is too huge for any one man to finish. The rice was subtly flavoured with olive and it wasn't too oily. If you want a healthier choice instead of pineapple fried rice, this is it.5. Asparagus $6The asparagus was cooked well and it was soft. The sauce was salty and it went well with the bland vegetables. 7. Green Curry with Beef $8Probably one of the worst green curry I have eaten, the colour looked off and it didn't have the distinctive green curry flavour. In the bowl, there were tiny strips of beef again, exactly the same as the beef kway teow soup. 8. Red Ruby $3Everyone at the table loved the red ruby, decorated with a slice of a jack fruit on top, there were tons of crunchy red ruby and the coconut milk was just right. It had a good level of ""lemak"" taste.A very cooling dessert to end off the day.Here is our family feast for 4 people. There were hits and misses, sadly mostly misses. Maybe we have to come back and try other dishes, because this coffee shop thai restaurant must be doing something right to have 7 outlets and non stop queues on weekends."

So if some person orders 20-30 portions for take away, then expect wait +1 hour, which unfortunately happen to me. I would estimate only a 20-30min wait in line if the people in front of you only order portions for their own dining. The actual 肠粉 is very good and you can tastes the different from what you get in restaurants. The shrimp is also very fresh and excellent texture. Combine these with the sauces and you have a five star dish. But with the +1 hour wait standing in line, i'd deduct one star for the total experience.

Shin Yuu is my go-to ala carte buffet place when I'm feeling particularly peckish and hungry. I have never had a bad meal there though I would recommend being firm on what you want and don't want from their list of ""special items"". I don't like cheese gooped on all my food, so I just eat stuff like the smoked duck. Shin Yuu is great because they have an extensive sashimi selection and the fish is decently fresh and served in generous portions. The sushi, both traditional and fusion, are great. They offer some interesting takes on the grilled or stir fried dishes and the fried soft shell crabs are never disappointing. The servers are good about getting your orders in and I've only had 1-2 gone missing in all the visits I've made. Finally the Singaporean owner/chef is quite personable so if you do get to chat with him he'll crack you up. Shin Yuu to sum up, is a great meal if you're willing to pay for quality (its about $50-60 after service and taxes for dinner), decent service and not have to bother making reservations too far in advance. Plus it's on the Greenwood stretch if you live in the area you don't have to drag yourself downtown."

Dinner is more expensive but includes special dishes that are not on the regular menu. When I was there last, our meal started with a platter that included smoked ducked, grilled tuna belly nigiri, and special aburi sushi. The special aburi, in particular, was especially delicious, and that was in the menu so we helped ourselves to more.The service was excellent and prompt.

The Prawn Noodles and Ngoh Hiang Poh Piang probably got something to do with it. The queue here is generally long and the tables fully occupied but the queue and table wait clears fast. The table waiters cleans up pretty fast but sometimes they don't wipe the tables so do prepare some tissues. The place can also get pretty hot especially during hot days due to the ceiling and also the kitchen area. So do find a place outside or near the fan if you are sensitive to heat.There are different variations of the Prawn Noodle and you can have it soup based or dried Prawn Noodle. I always opt for the dry version as I like yo sprinkle loads of chilli powder onto the dried noodles and soup. The only grouse?? Small bowl of well flavoured prawn Soup and it's not refillable. The version I have is usually the Prawn Noodle with Bak Kut and I love how the condiments of the Noodle mixes well with the Chilli Powder. The Bak Kut is also soft and I love how not to ""porky"" it tastes. The Prawns have been slitted and the shell comes off easily. It's really tasty when mixed with the chilli powder and the condiments. Take a mouthful of noodles and then slurp it down with the soup! Yummy!!Usually I would also buy Ngoh Hiang with white fried prawn cracker, Century Eggs, Chinese Sausages, Fried Bean Curd and Fried Fish Balls to go with the meal. The oil that has been used to re-fry some of the items are usually well filtered and changed so you will not expect to have a smelly plate of Ngoh Hiang like in some other places. A good cup of cold barley drink is also my usual to complete my meal! Happy me!!"

On balance, I am inclined to agree, for the eater, gastronomy should as much about the journey as the destination...but I can't help it.  It somehow seems unpatriotic, un-Singaporean, not to take pictures of your food, especially when it's as pretty and aromatic a bowl as the folks at Blanco put together.Ask about this deceptively simple dish and the responses are likely to be as robust and varied as the flavors embodied in the broth.   Can something so simple really be perceived so many different ways?  There is no easy answer, largely because Hokkien prawn noodle soup is not so much a bowl of food as a part of the Singapore story.*   In short, no two prawn noodle experiences are alike, depending on your history, if any, with the dish.  It is precisely because it is as foundational to Singaporean gastronomy and so much a part of Singapore's own brief history, that Hokkien prawn noodle soup can be such an evocative food experience, and why everybody has their own backstory when it comes to this classic of Singaporean hawker fare.   Food is as much about memory as it is about taste, food associated with fond memories will always taste far better than the ingredients or preparation can reasonably make it.  The converse is equally true.  I, for example, get a tightness between the shoulders and am overcome by a sense of resignation and malaise, every time I have green bean soup, the same feeling I used to get during night snacks in basic military training as a raw recruit, but I digress.Blanco's version of Hokkien prawn noodle soup has all the necessary ingredients for lush nostalgia.  The broth is thick and brown, bearing the  gravitas of slowly stewing roasted pork bones and the heady miasma of steeped prawn heads, shells and fish racks. What you notice is the spicy, aromatic, almost nutmeg-like sweet finish, cleansing your palate and waking it up at the same time and readying it for the next mouthful.    Tasting this broth is like falling through a wormhole and coming up on the other side in a simpler time of street-side dining, surrounded by family all perched precariously on rickety stools around a small folding table, their smiling faces just visible through the rising steam of bowls of Hokkien prawn broth, and your mother leaning over to offer you a spoonful of noodle and steamy broth, while you are distracted by a calico stray cat peering out from just beyond the corona of the pushcart noodle stall's pressure gas lamp, eyes bright for the odd table scrap.  The bustle of street traffic, the hiss of the pressure lamp and the boiling broth, the soundtrack to this lush visual memory.More contemporary versions of Hokkien prawn noodle soup feature pork fat less prominently, which I find disturbing.   That layer of pork fat that used to accompany more traditional servings of Hokkien prawn noodle soup was the perfect vessel for all those ancient and subtle flavors, the fat allowed these ethereal and volatile flavors to linger on the palate long enough to be appreciated.  So, the lower the fat content, the less harmonious and more ""one-note"" the broth becomes.  Blanco has a very decent broth, it is bright without being two dimensional.  Hokkien prawn noodle soup lives and dies on the broth alone.  The noodles can be added if one is looking for a more substantial meal, but the broth has been traditionally even been served by itself with the addition of condiments such as bean sprouts, cilantro and kang kong.  Blanco has also faithfully adhered to the traditional addition of chunks of pig tail, something that you don't find all that often any more.  In my book, the folks at Blanco deserve a place in my Hall of Hallowed Gastronomy because of this one thing.  The skin and fat fall off the bone and you slurp and suck your way around the tail bone till its clean.  If you're ordering the 3-in-1 prawn noodle soup, then enjoy the ribs which are fall off the bone tender with the flesh rapidly dissolving in your mouth once off the bone.  There's also wonderfully gelatinous pig skin which is reminiscent of sea cucumber, except porkier.  Cleanse with a mouthful of broth and repeat, and repeat and repeat.  There are a few other details that you are likely  to remember, the alkaline starch of the yellow noodles, the crunch of fresh blanched sprouts, the herbal and almost floral heat of the fresh cut chilies, and the taste of ocean from the prawn flesh, but none of these details, will cling, almost parasitic, in your memory like that the memory of that deep dark broth, whispering secrets going down.* For an excellent summary of what this dish is and its roots, read Bonny Tan's excellent writeup on Infopedia (infopedia.nl.sg/articles…)."

Have you visited the Taiwan Porridge place that has been in business for more than 38 years? Oasis Taiwan Porridge is previoulsy located next to our Indoor Stadium in Kallang opposite the old National Stadium. They have relocated to Toa Payoh Town Park that is opposite the HDB hub and also next to Toa Payoh Swimming Complex.A homely taste of velvety porridge with sweet potato included. Best that its free flow and a big warm pot of it was kept by the side table for you to refill.The Prawn Roll looks abit dry here rather than the glossy appearance but we were all glad that it was not greasy. The fillings were hot and we took caution when sinking our teeth down into it.Prawn Roll - $8 (Small)""Chye Poh"" egg aka Preserved Raddish comes in a beautiful round shape and was yummy. It was not salty and even taste as good alone without the porridge. Texture was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. Wow!Chye Poh Omelette - $10 This was one of the signature Teochew dishes that we had ordered. Braised duck with Tau Kwa was soaked in sweet savoury braised sauce. I will recommend the dish as the meat was not too ""old"", easily chew and succulent. Every piece was well immersed in the ""Lor Chap"" aka Braised Sauce and just goes very well on the plate.Braised Duck with Tau Kwa - $16 (Small)If you eat Pig's Intestine, you will definitely like this as these braised intestine was well handled and does not have any gamy taste. In fact the combination of salted vegetable and intestine had executed well.Braised Pig Intestine with Salted Vegetable - $9 (Small)Forget about the calories, the stew pork is definitely awesome. With distinctive layers of the pork that melts in your mouth. Biting on them is effortless with such fork tender meat and the best thing was that it was not greasy at all.Stew Pork - $10 (Small)If you are planning for a family meal, Oasis Taiwan Porridge will be a good choice. For its simple and no frills meal with nostalgic environment, moreover they have big round tables which is good for families with kids too."

With her fastest fingers, check yelp first lah! Wow. Good reviews on yelp! Must try! The menu is categorised into aglio olio, tomato based and cream based pasta. Price range between $7 to $10. Very affordable lunch for workers in the area. There are some uncomfortable side seats where you face their busy work area & the table makes my legs awkward. I chose a seat at the corner so that i can sit sideway to enjoy my meal. You order, pay, get your receipt with q nos and wait for your number to be called. The staff has a super bright smile and happily entertained my request of putting chili padi in my pasta. You have no idea how this made me so so so delighted. Haha. I love chilli padi in my cream pasta & had a runny nose for a week already. That chilli really made my day. He look very happy putting up my request & even ask cheekily: you want more cheese?! Hehe. Oh my.. Because of him, im giving another 1 star. Ok here comes my pasta. The cream is so thick & very generous portion! With slices of chicken breast, edamame, tonnes of herbs & spags, this $7 of goodiness is the best food i had in the week. (Been eating plain food.. Zzz) I love it & will return again.

I was first brought here eat during my schooling days by my family. The stall occupied 2 units and non aircon, similar to the usual coffee shop. The stall originated from KL, Malaysia. When we sat down, the staff asked there was many people and planned the menu for us. With about 6 to 7 persons, she recommended us having a plate of the signature dish which was the Yong Tau Fou, as well as, a plate of assorted roasted meat. With the 7 of us ordering drinks such as homemade barley and tea, the total bill came up to $58.70. By the way there was no breakdown.The signature Yong Tau Foo consisted of fried bean curd stick, fried wanton, fried quail egg, fish ball, tau kwa, tau pok, tofu, brinjal, lady's finger, bitter gourd on top of boiled kangkong, topped with their secret gravy. I like the crispy crackling fried bean curd stick, which was not too hard. We had the dish with chicken flavoured rice. The gravy went very well with the rice. I wish that the fish paste stuffing in the yong tau fou could be more as I could barely taste it.For the assorted roasted meat, we selected Roasted Duck and Roasted Pork as one of us did not take Roasted Chicken. The meat was not bad.Overall the food was not and was served fast despite the place was packed during Sunday lunch time. Wish that we were given time to think of what to have instead of being pressured to order."

Suffice to say that I am not disappointed! The yong tau foo was very fresh and the gravy was heavenly! It's slightly starchy and thick, and tasted of roasted garlic and yellow bean. Hard to describe but I really liked the gravy. I also had some standard ingredients such as fishballs, pork dumplings, beancurd skin and so on, and all the ingredients were very nice.

It's a gem with remarkable tenacity - it has been open for more at least five years now, which is a feat considering the short lifespans of other non-hawker eateries along the road.I usually come here for a cosy dinner and a bottle of beer. The food here is not remarkable but decent enough, some items I have ordered are the Curry Fries (absolutely delicious), Shepherd's Pie (not bad), Chicken Schnitzel (good) and Pomodoro Chicken Wrap (average). You can choose your poison of choice from the wide selection of beers and ciders. On my last visit, a friend ordered a new cider they had just brought in (can't remember the name but it was strawberry flavoured) and it was good, not overly sweet like most other fruit ciders. My only gripe is that the prices of the food is a bit more expensive than what I would pay for at such a location. The vibe here is very laid-back and non-pretentious, and feels a bit like a backpacker's cafe with a shelf of travel guides and memorabilia from a number of countries."

I guess it's the travel books, variety of beer and casual vibe of the place. We had the pomodoro chicken, spinach and cheese crepe and shared some wholegrain mustard buffalo wings. You can't go wrong with a freshly made crepe. This tasted good but did not wow. The crepe was light and crisp on the outside, so that was good but the filling was just OK for me. Would have appreciated more chicken in the crepe. Further, before ordering, I had asked the server if there was sauce in the crepe. She said that there was ""tomato"" in the crepe which I understood to mean ""tomato sauce"" given my question . Turns out, there was no sauce, but tomatoes. Fine with me, since I wouldn't have wanted sauce in any case. It would have been nice if the cafe had a choice of batter for the crepe - e.g. wholewheat etc.The wholegrain mustard buffalo wings were good. For the price of the can drinks at $3, I would have expected them to be chilled. Maybe I'm picky, but a warm can of coke, even when poured into ice, tastes different from a chilled can of coke. It's less gassy. Also, do make reservations as I was turned down once when the place was packed for dinner."
