The steamed prawns with garlic was just flat out not good. Can easily tell the prawns were not fresh. The texture was completely mushy on every single piece. The only decent plate was the veggie, which is incredibly hard to mess up. Should have known something was to since there was only 3 tables occupied at close to peak hours.

How did it take so long for us to realise how awesome it is?!They're a seafood restaurant but they also do meat dishes pretty well. A lot of their main dishes take time to prepare (it could be a half hour wait, or even longer during peak dining hours) but the wait is seriously worth it.If you're already hungry, I'd start with the salted egg fried fish skin appetizer. WARNING: These are extremely addictive. Crispy, just the right amount of salt, and not at all fishy. Almost like potato chips.They even have a chicken rice stall within the restaurant, so you could order from them if you need something to hold you over while you wait.The crab dishes here are fantastic. We've tried the steamed crab with hua diao wine, and the steamed crab with glutinous rice. If I had to choose, I'd go with the glutinous rice, because that in itself is already delicious.Last but not least, I really love their kou rou bao (steamed buns with marinated braised pork belly.) Again, this dish takes time to make, but DAMN SON. The pork is so tender and the sauce is boss.This is a great spot to go to if you have a big group, as the round tables can fit about 8 people each. Plus, the portions are big here, so they're meant for sharing."

This place opened along Joo Chiat Road a couple of years ago under the name ""Ubin Seafood"" owned by the people who formerly ran the original seafood restaurant on Pulau Ubin.To further add to the confusion, in 2012 there was a change of management, and the name of the place changed from ""Ubin Seafood"" to ""Ubin Kitchen"". Chatter on the internet forums tells me that the head chef from the original Ubin establishment still helms the kitchen.Complicated history aside, it's possible to rattle off a laundry list of signature dishes that one should order:Steamed crab & glutinous rice (for 3-4 persons at $58)Bamboo ClamsOyster Hokkien NoodlesSteamed belly pork buns (Kou Rou Bao)fried shrimp rolls (hae zhor)salted egg yolk squidfried rice noodles (bee hoon)In particular, the oyster noodles were tender and had a hearty sauce, old school style. You see clams in the photo but there's some oysters somewhere hiding beneath the noodles. The pork buns were a DIY affair, fluffy steamed buns arrive separate from the pork and you'd have to create your pork sandwich yourself.

The steamed buns came hot and fresh, while a separate plate held five slices of marinated braised pork belly. A a bit of a Do-it-yourself burger where you take a strip of pork belly put it inside a steam bun. If you'd like, you can also add a strip of lettuce to make it the more ""healthy."" :PAs for the steamed crab, it was nothing short of special. This is not just some crab you put in a steamer and that's it. Nope, these crabs have a sophisticated flavour that blends hua diao wine with the juices of the crab. Wow. While all the crabs in Singapore focus on Chili Crabs or Pepper Crabs, it was nice to try something different for a change.Overall, the food at Ubin Kitchen was fantastic! Food wise, I'm of the view that it's 4.5 stars, but have settled on 4 stars since the server did not inform us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for both dishes."

It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The steamed crab is cooked in hua diao wine and ginger.

We loved japanese food and the first restaurant that caught our eye was this as we were too hungry to search for the mall directory. We had never tried the food at this restaurant before and was rather intrigue by its menu. They don't service the usual japanese fare. There are a lot of stewed and nabe (hot pot) in their menu. They also dish out food for the health conscious as you can choose the 5 grain rices and all. Great discovery and will definitely check out their other joints.

Sitting in the coffee shop, one feels immediately immersed in the life of the heartlands, with the friendly Indian uncle who greets you in Chinese or dialect and never fails to crack us up. However, any local would know that Mr. Teh Tarik is a chain store with outlets in many places, a representation of the capital progress of our nation. This particular outlet is my favourite though for the atmosphere - a real, old-school coffee shop that never fails to remind me of what Singapore is to me. The prata here is crispy and not bad, and of course, the teh tarik is good too. For those who like to hang around the area, it is an excellent place for supper when it is not so hot to be sitting outdoors. The prices are reasonable at a dollar for the teh tarik, so it is inexpensive too. For the friendly neighbourly feel that is quintessentially the Singapore I remember, I'd definitely be back for many times more in the future ahead."

Then we ordered the set meal for 8 but they said we couldnt have it as ""no big prawns"" so we had to think all over again for a la cart which was only $80 less with less dishes and no doubt lowe value food. The fried rice was only egg no seafood for $ 26 and one small bowl each. The service continued to be inept and nonchalant, even rude. We didnt feel we were wanted there.

The famous pepper and chili crabs lived up to their hypes. All other foods were fantastic. Every dish that we ordered was good.

Once she took the initiative order, she checked with the chef on the ingredients and to warn him to wash the woks before preparing these special dishes. I noticed she was wearing a hair net after talking with the chef. This made me think there is a high standard level of cleanliness in the kitchen.All the dishes we ordered were equally great. Plus she order exactly the correct amount so nothing was left for 14 people. We have no idea how much we ordered of each item so we're now anticipating the bill. What did we get?Chili and pepper crab. I preferred the black pepper both both were good.  I liked the vegetable dishes. The produce is very fresh. One was Chinese broccoli and scallops and the other dragon greens, mushrooms and garlic. Cereal shrimp (okay but others liked it), beef and onion, fried cod (cubed) and shrimp friend rice. Lastly the mini buns were light and the outside crust lightly crunchy. With about 5 sodas and 10% service, the total price was $750 for 14 or about $50 a person. The service was fantastic.

Honestly, I was a bit disoriented.  Sweet is dessert for me, not a main course.  Maybe it was an off night, and more sugar was added than less.  Maybe I'm spoiled with phenom Indo-Vietnamese-Malaysian-Chinese-Cambodian-Lao-Korean-Thai chefs educating my palate in Los Angeles.  Maybe.  Willing to cut some slack here but if this dish should be soulfully sweet, then that was the last time I will have had the famous chilli crab.  I can't claim the crabmeat tasted sweet because it didn't (the creature traveled from another country).  Had it been caught in the nearest river or sea, it would have been sweet.   The other dishes we ordered were very good however:  prawns with golden salted egg, mee goreng Malay style, kang kong, fried rice.   Service was very good.Tip:  Jumbo Seafood is also a tourist destination, prices are high, even for Singapore.  I'd come to this location if you were to visit as it's on the water, if you like H20.  Check out the Yelpista pix."

Suppressing all scepticism, I took a visiting friend to Jumbo which is one of the four chilli crab Meccas here all lined conveniently next to each other along East Coast park. We got one chilli crab to share between two of us which cost around $62. No chilli crab is complete without deep fried buns to mop up the gravy and Jumbo's are just sheer perfection: crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside with just a slight sweetness to them. At this point, I need to throw up my hands and admit that YES Jumbo's serves some pretty damn good chilli crab. The gravy is delicious. Rich and thick, the best part is the sharp kick to it at the end. I was expecting it to be a lot spicier than it was but it had too much flavour packed into it to make up for it. The crab itself was juicy and tender. We struggled to get all the flesh out of the shell but it's worth prying out every little bit. The atmosphere is also incredibly relaxing especially if you snag an outside table right next to the ocean. The staff were all very prompt and efficient. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they made no motion to hurry us and even gave us a 10% discount at the end for no reason! My only gripe is the very small vegetarian selection which is somewhat understandable at a seafood restaurant. My mother got rice with vegetable stir fry which came in a tiny portion costing $18.

Quality of the crab is excellent - sweet fresh crab that goes well with the sauce. The black pepper crab is not as good though so perhaps stick to the chili crab for Jumbo.

Although I love crab, my boyfriend isn't a fan but we still decided to go because our new friends in Hong Kong raved about trying pepper and/or chili crab. We ordered:- Chili crab- Fried cod fish with spicy sauce- Scallops wrapped in yam ring- Broccoli with scallops- Steamed (white) buns and deep fried bunsThe chili crab was wonderful! The crab we received, a portion size for three people, was the largest crab I've ever seen!! Certainly fitting considering the name of the restaurant. I'm not usually a fan of filling up on bread, but it was difficult to resist dipping the steamed buns in the chili crab sauce. And.. this is was after I ate spoonfuls on top of my rice. So much flavor!The broccoli with scallops were fine, but the scallops wrapped in yam were even better! My boyfriend almost decided to get a second order of them. Finally, the fried cod fish was delicious! I would order that again as well. Our bill ended up around SGD 200-250.. If you're not opposed to taking a day trip to Malaysia (possible via bus, car or taxi), we were told you can get much more pepper or chili crab for much cheaper there! Regardless, I highly recommend you check this place out if you're in Singapore! Extra tips and FYIs:- There is no AC!- Make reservations if you want to avoid a long wait during certain days or times.- The menu has plenty of pictures and English to help guide your ordering.- Chili crab can be quite messy; I recommend using the disposable bibs they give out.- Don't be afraid to flag down any server you see if you need something!- If you have trouble breaking through the HUGE claws or other parts of the crab, you can put them on a plate and ask the server to have the kitchen break them for you! You don't want any going to waste :)"

We were seated quite quickly due to our reservation, and it was outside the restaurant closer to the water. I didn't really like our table because it was pretty close to where everybody goes to smoke so I occasionally had the odor of cigarette smoke while eating, but it wasn't too bad.The Chili crab and satays were very good, but the black pepper crab was too peppery.The cereal prawns had a lot of cereal but not too much prawn. The fish in banana leaf was decent. Overall it was pretty decent but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."

The east coast branch is by far the most popular on the island. I am guessing it's because of its complimentary location near the sea adds to one's seafood dining experience. It's super crowded on weekend evenings. Do not attempt to go without a booking, especially if it is a public holiday weekend. Overall, Jumbo doesn't disappoint. It serves quality seafood amidst a casual and family-friendly environment. Singaporean families (across generations - think aunty, uncle, cousins...) gather here for good seafood. Food: 1. Pepper crab - Awesome! Get your bibs ready! It can get messy. 2. Chili crab sauce & man tou - I LOVE their man tous (fried buns). It's fried to golden perfection! Crispy on the outside but soft & smooth on the inside. I could eat a plate of these (they are pretty small in size), especially dipped in chili sauce. TIP: you can order the chili crab sauce without having to order the whole crab itself. So you can have your crab in another sauce (black pepper) and still get to enjoy the wholesome goodness of dipping your man tous in the chili sauce. Double happiness. 3. Fried you tiao - LOVE! These are fried doughs stuffed with fish paste. It may sound strange to foreigners but they are heavenly. A must-try for sure. 4. Mee goreng - Good. A little spicy though. Be warned. 5. Mix vegetable & mushrooms - Good. The mushrooms were so fresh. 6. Steam prawns with egg - LOVE! The prawn was so fresh & sweet. It comes served with a sweet black sauce which goes so well with the prawns. I could eat this all day. Service: - Very efficient!"

The one on the East Cost is the best (IMHO). There is nothing fancy about this restaurant.  Come to sit by the ocean on uncomfortable plastic chairs, enjoy some cold beer, and devour as many crabs as you can.  The awesome Jumbo experience is very simple and consists of only five elements, so anyone can execute this plan.  Here it is:1) Sit outside, not inside2) Order beer, and then keep ordering it throughout the meal (you'll see why shortly)3) Order lots of Chili Crabs4) Order a ton of Man-tou buns (fried, not steamed).5) After you are done with the first 4 things, order Sago for dessert (even if the waitstaff gives you a hard time about it).I believe Chili Crab may be one of nature's most perfect food substances.  The crab is huge, meaty, and sweet.  The sauce is beyond compare - rich, tangy, and oh so spicy.  And extra good when you sop it up with the Man-tou (kind of like little savory doughnuts).  Lot's of fried spicy goodness there.  Order double the number of buns they suggest - I seem to prefer a higher bun to sauce ratio then is standard.I see many reviewers indicate you should go with Black Pepper Crab.  While that is a fine dish, I've always preferred the sauciness of Chili Crab.  But try them both - you can't go wrong.  Also, remember to wear clothes that can get soiled.  Those crabs are messy, but that is half the fun.Finally, let me put in a word for Sago.  It's kind of like cold sweetened coconut soup with melon balls and ice shavings.  Delicious, refreshing, and the perfect antidote to your burning lips from the yummy Chili Crab.  My Father almost passed out from delight the first time he had Sago here.In short, when I next make the long, long, long trip from Chicago to Singapore I will be heading to Jumbo."

Not because of the food, no, no, but because of how messy you will get eating the delicious, drool inducing chili crab. This is some of the best stuff on earth. Seriously. If you come here for nothing else you will be quite happy. The crab is really fresh and the sauce is just so he right amount of spicy. It's very messy and finger lickin good. We also had the cereal prawn that was just a bit too sweet, it tastes very similar to coconut shrimp and also the yam covered scallops. They were also very good. You obviously have to have beer with your chili crab so make sure to grab a pitcher of tiger. This is the third or fourth time here from America, I will always come back here to eat. I love it so much. I'll be coming here for years to come. I wish they sold the chili sauce by the gallon. I would just drink it."

In California we have different types of crab so was almost positive it would not turn out the same :( It's also really good if you dip your bread into the chili sauce!

Perfect blend of a spicy and sweetness of a crabBoiled live shrimp comes in a wine soup - get about 3 per person.Chicken/Beef kabobs- tastes good if you dip it in their peanut sauce!Malaysia dry noodle- reminded me to be similar to a spaghetti with seafood in it. Mango- not sure if its the right season or if its just always good- but the mango is soft and sweet! perfect way to end your meal.Ate a lot more- but can't remember the names.

Order some fried buns (mantou) to soak up some of that delicious chilli sauce, and you've got a fantastic meal. It gets pricey, but it's worth it. A few tips for those non-natives ( that I learned the hard way): there are no napkins. How you're expected to eat this crab with no provided napkins is beyond me, but that's how it's done in SG. Stop by a convenience store and pick up a multi-pack of tissues, since that's what everyone uses for napkins. The restaurant provides you with a finger bowl to rinse your hands while eating.

Order a few of the fried mantou (buns) on the side, and get ready to soak up all that saucy goodness! (Trust me, you'll need more mantou than you think!)  For what you pay (about $55 a kg) it's pricey.  A crab will be anywhere between $50-80, and it's not a whole lot of food, but hey, when in Singapore...The cereal prawn ($20 or so) is also really good, make sure you order it with the shell off. Breaded in a slightly sweet and crunchy cereal breading, it's well worth a try.And don't be afraid of wearing the bib for the crab (ask for it if they don't offer), even the locals do it!"

I heard Singapore is known for their spicy crabs so of course we had to go somewhere really authentic to get it. This restaurant has a really nice bay view but it was raining that day so we couldn't sit outside to enjoy the scene. So the food. There was 13 of us and we ordered what seemed like everything on the menu so that we can try a little of everything. We got the spicy crab and the peppered crab which I guess for a non-seafood eater was pretty decent although I still wouldn't go out of my way to eat crab. My family really enjoyed it since they are seafood lovers. I do have to agree that it's probably the most flavorful crab I've ever tasted. To be honest, what I loved most about the meal was the little buns that came with the crabs. It really was just white dough with a little sugar but it was so soft and chewy and I think I probably had ten pieces all by myself. It was an overall good meal but because I don't really like seafood, I probably don't have the best judgment. One little boo boo was that they messed up our dessert and gave us a 13 people portion instead of a single serving like we asked and ended up just not giving us anything in the end after we waited for it foreverrrr. The service wasn't great but I guess we were a pretty loud annoying group with two babies that anyone would find hard to deal with."

The staff were friendly, accomadating and spoke ok English. The line of sushi chefs wore gloves and mouth guards. They cranked out an endless line of sushi and other items. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all very tasty. The portions were on the small side, but the prices were reasonable (s$2-9) on most things, so we were able to have a wider variety of items.We loved that besides soy sauce, each table had a supply of wasabi and pickled ginger."

The broth is rich in flavour and explodes in your mouth. The uncle even makes it an emphasis (a sign) that he doesn't re-fill the soup as it would dilute the flavours. Wow, that's quality.

He gives 3 pieces of prawn and slices of lean pork meat along with a regular bowl, and nothing to complain.

As soon as I saw it, I had to have it. I'm obsessed with Sushirrito in the Bay Area and always order a sushi burrito when it's available. I was excited at first to see they had very similar rolls like Salmon Samba and Geishas Kiss, though under different names. I should have been deterred by the first reviewer, but I did not heed those wise words, and my excitement diminished when I realized they wouldn't make me a fresh sushi burrito. All the rolls are displayed as halves, so I thought maybe if I ordered a full roll they'd make me new one (nope, just two halves). And of course, it tasted like it's been sitting around for a while. Sushirrito tells you it's best enjoyed immediately, and I think that's true with any sushi burrito. Moist seaweed just doesn't stay good for long. Overall, not terrible, but not worth it."

The sushi burrito is alright. I've had better and would not recommend this. They have a display of their various sushi burrito options on the window for you to choose from. You can either get a half burrito or full burrito. The rice was bland and the veggies tasted old (not fresh). I  got the rainbow shrimp burrito, which consisted of prawn tempura. However the prawn tempura was mushy and soft on the outside. You can tell that the burrito had been sitting out for a while and not fresh.

Sushi burrito is basically like an uncut sushi roll with more ingredients. While that can sound attractive because hei, who doesn't like sushi?, but Sushi Burrito did it completely all wrong. I tried their unagi sushi burrito. The amount of unagi is like the amount you would get on 4 pieces of unagi sushi while the rice and fillers would make maybe 4 sets of sushi roll (4 x 6/8 of your regular sushi!). What are the fillers? Cucumbers, pickled veggies, onions and LOTS of rice. If I want my veggies, I would go get myself a bowl of salad. Lots of veggies maybe good for you but I paid to get a meal where I can taste unagi in most of my bites. Nope. It was mostly rice and veggies. For the price, I would not recommend this place. On the good side, their packaging is very handy for a quick grab and it is a healthy option."

But i began to remove those thought as soon as I had my second bite. They are different. It taste so good and still fresh although i doubt it when i arrive at the stall and looking at those sushiburrito that already displayed. They just took those premade sushi and served it. Although it is still good, i wish they can make it fresh. Idk how it works for people who order half size. Maybe they will make the fresh version of that? Perhaps. So i just want to conclude my review that Sushi Burrito is a better version of handroll sushi that i usually have. It taste better than normal sushi or hand roll. It has good appearance. But perhaps, maybe more experimental flavor/sauce in the future. Note: the wasabi burned me"

It is not too far from the Kembangan MRT and you could probably see the signboard from afar.Came here as Mel had purchased 2 Sugar coupons for the waffles and we decided to try the waffles with Hokkaido Milk & Honey and Figs . We also ordered the B.F.F. 4 types of fries and four types of sauces. The waffle was over-crispy but the ice creams were delicious. It was melting on the tongue after putting it in your mouth. Didn't really like the waffle that much as this time round it was over-cooked.The B.F.F. was interesting mix of fries. I like the truffle fries as it was crunchy but it doesn't have much truffle flavor on it. The wedges and the criss-cut fries were al-right (probably cause I've been eating too much other stuffs before coming here). I didn't try the shoestring fries (Curly fries?). The dips I have no clue what they are besides the tartar sauce.This place is rather cosy and inviting. On the walls it has writings and interesting quotes. Was not as crowded as I thought it maybe especially on a Saturday evening. Definitely a good place to hang out or even board game sessions :)

From what I understand it has opened for over a year now and I have just learnt about this place via the SUGAR app. It is within walking distance of Kembangan MRT. We managed to easily find a parallel parking street parking spot along Changi Road.1. Rack o' Ribs ($22.80)The great BBQ aroma from this dish would make anyone hungry! It was slighly charred to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. For Singapore standards it's pretty good, still nowhere near what I used to eat daily in the States. For $22.80 it's not too pricey, although that's as much as I would ever pay for ribs in Singapore.The meat was juicy and tender. The ribs were well executed with the barbecue sauce over nicely done meat.2. Waffles with Ice Cream ($5.80 each)With the SUGAR app, we managed to buy each waffle with ice cream for about $2 each! But nonetheless even at $5.80 It's still quite reasonable, compared to some cafes that charge like $9 for a whole waffle and ice cream. This is indeed only half a waffle but there's so much to love about this waffle.The waffle is delightfully crispy! It is not the fluffy kind, some online reviewers have mentioned that it tastes like over-cooked waffles or even ""burnt"". But to me, it was nice and crispy and I like it this way. The chocolate ice cream was a bit bitter, the green tea ice cream was nice and had the legit green tea taste in there. The salted caramel was the sweet ice cream amongst the 3 flavours. The waffle was slightly salty, some of my friends didn't like it so salty, but I felt that it was a good compliment for the salted caramel ice cream, since the ice cream was so sweet. Waffles and ice cream! Who can resist such a great combination of colours and flavours.The food at Rice & Fries may not be super awesome , it's nevertheless tasty and the ambience is very enjoyable.

The taste was very savory and the crust was thin and crispy. I personally like the crust to be thin, and pizzas with crusts that are overly thick and floury turn me off.We also had a few other pizzas such as the triple meat pizza and the pepperoni pizza, which were all good but no doubt, the pizza to try here is the seafood pizza.

The charred fatty cuts of meat are pretty much amazing, and I'm partial to the roast pork and roast chicken. It's also reasonably priced, at around S$4-6 for a packet of chicken rice. Ask for the dark meat (chicken thigh) instead of the leaner cuts. Trust me, it's worth the calories.The stall is located within the coffeeshop named ""Keng Bee Restaurant"" at the corner of the building facing the Caltex gas station. Seating within the coffeeshop is limited and there's parking at the back. The line is out the door pretty much at lunchtime, so do come early before they sell out.Depending on how long the line is, the guy at the stall might get a little grouchy or impatient with you. I also have to knock them for a less than stellar chilli sauce which is practically watered down beyond recognition.The stall is closed on Tuesdays, and a different hawker helms the evening shift at the same stall, so be aware that the food served might be different at dinner.TLDR; Old school roast chicken and roast pork with charred fatty cuts, reasonably priced but a bad attitude with a long wait.

It's got three layers of heaven: (i) juicy inside, (ii) marbled fatty area  and (iii) a crunchy skin.

Word of Advice: To best enjoy the roast pork, DO NOT put any sauce on top. It will dilute the flavor. However, be sure to ask the uncle to put sauce on top of the rice. The separation of rice with sauce and the roast pork is just a perfect complement.  Lines are obviously long, Locals already know this little secret.

So I got a plate of char siew + siew yoke rice, and sat down to wolf it down.Fate intervened of course, and uncle had generously slapped on my plate some rough cut meats, liberally marbled with soft, juicy fat. As I took a second to admire his handiwork before shovelling it into my now ravenous mouth-hole, I realised the beauty in what lay before me - the rough cut meant he did not stinge on razor-thin slivers, and the chunkier segments offered more bite and flavour, so I could really experience the char in his char siew.Though I did savour each tasty morsel, it was gone too soon, and all I had left was the simple soup to end what was a very tasty meal for just three dollars.

To upsize your steak, pay $5 extra.By all means it's not the best steak, you get what you pay for, really. Beef quality is only a small notch above Aston's or Jack's place. Fries are crispy out of the fryer, and for the salad, you get butter lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce. If you're in the mood, they do serve caipirinhas. :)4 stars cos it's value for money, but don't come in here expecting Morton's or Ruth's Chris.

The best deal on the menu is easily the signature Meat (you are getting the steak, no questions asked) served with an UNLIMITED supply of French fries and fresh lettuce.  P.S I wish they replaced the French fries with rice, kidding! Clearly, this is not an Asian restaurant :-)For doneness of my meat, I chose medium-rare. The rib eye steak came out fantastic. I had no idea the French could grill! You also have the option of three sauces: mango, mustard and chipotle to mix with your steak and fries. Don't fret, if there is no seating space on the first floor. There is a large 2nd floor with another set of 8 dinning tables or more. it's a bit neat to see expats living in the neighborhood playing a card game of sorts on the second floor during the evening. The big surprise is that there is a beautiful terrace in the back that accommodates 20 or more people, if you are keen for a fun night amongst friends under neath the stars and in an enclosed outdoor setting.Four stars for the price - $20 for char grilled steak and unlimited homemade fries and the fact you won't find this type of restaurant anywhere else on Joo Chiat or anywhere else on the East Coast for that matter."

Their coffee is amazing, so be sure to order some of their specialty ones. I don't remember the name of it, but one had salted peanut butter on the rim of the cup and was really good. All of their breakfast items were excellent. Even if you just go for a coffee, be sure to order the little coconut donuts to go with. It's an easy walk from the main street in Chinatown called Tajong Pagar. Plus, the AC is nice and frosty  :)"

Bit of a surprise as I didn't know about this place, happened to walk by it when hungry.I walked in on a weekday lunch hour and found the place just opened for the day. Ordered the Avocado Toast dish and an iced americano then took a seat out in the garden patio area.They brought out the plate and it was just beautiful to look at, almost didn't want to eat it. This easily was the best tasting (and looking) Avocado Toast I've ever eaten. Highly recommend.Although having the main entrance on the side street is a bit of a nuisance. Otherwise it's a great cafe to hang and grab a bite!"

The decor certainly is very impressive with books neatly arranged from wall to wall and old phones decorated at various locations. The ambience is great for catch up with friends over a drink. We've ordered our main courses all from the promo menu and truffle Parmesan fries. It took close to 20 mins before the fries arrived followed by pasta and burger. The Pork neck grill took another 10 mins to be delivered. Sadly, the burger and the Pork neck was more salty than needed while the pasta is blend. We are more sad that with all the truffle shavings on the pasta and pork neck, we can't smell the truffles. Which is very unusual as this is not the first time we've had truffle dishes. Even with the promotion, each dish is about $28. And for that price, I don't see the value when I have the 3 small pieces of pork neck done like schnitzels, topped with creamy sauce and potato chips that occupied half of the plate. We couldn't finish our food because I get tired chewing the pork neck and the pasta was too blend to warrant anymore consumption. The saving grace is the burger because it's not too big and, the parmesan fries has a very nice truffle mayo dip. I really want this place to work out better for customers because they are in a very nice location and the decor is great! I re"

The charming facade looks cozy and enticed us to make a quick stop to view the place.We ended up staying for an hour and a half!Very cozy atmosphere with unique, vintage-like decoration. The coffee was average in quality but the atmosphere was the pull factor for us to return the next time.Book lovers will rejoice as the place is a good, quiet hide-out from the busy world to have a cuppa and to have a good reading session. For those who want a place to chill out with friends and catch-up, there's a bigger seating area at the back for big groups. Board games and card games are also available and placed discreetly on the bookshelves - the trick is to be the first to find them!Will definitely recommend this place to friends."

We visited this cafe for a Sunday brunch after making a reservation, although the reservation was not a necessity! The moment you step inside the cafe, all the books arranged give you a very good vibe & make you feel you are in a library. They have lot of books of varied interests. We saw some of them even working on laptops or reading books for hours. The staff is really very friendly. One cannot visit this place with less time as it's a laid back cafe vibe with slow service. We ordered Eggs Benedict with portobello & Parmesan crisps and Smashed Avocado with Smoked salmon with Matcha latte & orange juice. While Matcha & juice was tasty & fresh, the food was bland. The food was very mediocre, no taste but it was fresh. This restaurant can be a gem only with better food service, hence did not deserve the 5 star. Overall it's an amazing place to read some books over coffee/tea with no time constraint!"

Set up to look like a library, The Reading Room has a varied selection of books to read (and to purchase) while being a full functioning café. I only went for afternoon drinks and was delightfully surprised by very nice happy hour offerings, on glasses of red and white wine as well as on beers, and other drinks. It did look like it had a nice brunch menu, and their burger offerings for dinner looked quite nice. At around 6:30 PM however, they shut off most of the lights, which I think was a real mood killer. No need to have lighting resembling that of a sketchy club, when you are in a nice café where people want to go to talk each other, and in fact, see each other too."
