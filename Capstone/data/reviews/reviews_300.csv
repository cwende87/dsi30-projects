There's no denying we love Peach Garden. Peach Garden Changi Airport is our must have breakfast / lunch venue when ever we're traveling. We love the thin flavorful skin of the Har Gow, the smooth, tasty goodness of the Century egg porridge, the the........ I think I'll save that for another review. With our love of Peach Garden's Dim Sum, nothing got us more excited than knowing that their Thomson Plaza outlet was starting a New Breakfast Concept, by bringing their ""variety of Dim Sums along with Eggs, sausages, Ham and a salad bar! How international! And all for $13.90NETT!Our reservation was at 8.00am and we couldn't wait! (Not that we didn't want to come later, but the staff recommended we come at 8.00 in case we do not have enough time to eat. It ends at 10.00am). We walked into the restaurant, bubbly and excited despite the 6.30am alarm, looked around aaaaannndddd.........We felt a huge hole open up, suck us in and continuously whispered in our ear ""is that it?""  Station 1: A 10 seater round table serving their Western Breakfast!The ""salad"" bar, was a large bowl of mix greens with 4 or 5 additional ingredients in smaller bowls at the sides. Plain white bread for toasted, with butter and jam? Fried Mantou, ""boiled"" ham and scrambled eggs with tomatoes (yes, the Chinese style, normally eaten with rice). Station 2:The ""amazing"" Dim Sum selection. According to the advert stating ""Choices of porridge"", sure, there was a choice. Plain white porridge with the choice to salted egg, salted Veg, preserved egg, preserved veg and fish with preserved veg. Their signature Dim Sum selection? Siew Mai, chive dumplings with no chives, Char Siew Pao, steam pork ribs, braised chicken feet, steamed meat in Beancurd skin, Chee Chiong Fun, Fried Radish Cake, Stir fried Veg and Hong Kong Noodle. And because they tried to do it buffet style, the steamers didn't have a lid and dumplings turned cold and hard very quickly. The noodles and Chee Chiong Fun were cold too. Radish cake was average. But what was disappointing was the lack of selection. No fried items as advertised. No har gow (prawn dumpling) and in terms of Dim Sum selection, there weren't really that many choices to chose from. Station 3: I got excited when someone said ""they have an egg station!"" Turns out, the egg station was only for making your regular sunny side up eggs. There were sausages at the side but what was supposed to be grilled and juicy sausages in the advertisement turned out to be frozen, 10 for $1.50 packet sausages, halved and deep fried.  We might not had been as disappointed had we not tried their other outlets before, that and how the entire set-up was a complete let down. It felt like a 2.5* hotel breakfast served with a 2* hotel set-up. Disappointing considering we know just how good they can be but instead of showcasing the very best of their breakfast, all they've showed was their ability to be gimmicky just to make a quick buck."

I really enjoyed it.There was a large variety of both steamed and fried dim sum - from staples like siew mai, har gow, fried mango prawn rolls to less traditional dishes like seafood dumplings. All the prawn dishes were really well done (fresh, sweet and crunchy), and definitely the highlight of the evening.The food were pushed around in large stacks on carts, and were piping hot and showed up really quickly. There was a smaller selection of soups, porridge and dessert on the self-service table, which were passable but did not leave a strong impression.In summary, tasty hot food with great service at a steal - it cost an average of S$20 per person (including GST and service charge) - 1 dine free for every 3 paying adults. Without the promotion, it would have worked out closer to S$25 per person. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

The garden theme The Interior decor gets a 4.5 stars: The garden-themed cafe is beautifully decorated with lots of plants & flowers, making it a little sanctuary with all the cute ornaments and knick knacks you can find all around the cafe. It is really perfect for couples or friends to have cosy get-togethers here. Unlike other cafes, the space is big! 2 storeys all in all, and the space between each table is of a good distance! No fear of people eavesdropping on your conversation, unless of course, you speak really loudly :p2. Florist This place is owned by Xpressflower.com, a long established florist chain with 16 outlets in SG (I found that out from their website). There is a cold room with lotsa flowers inside. It's quite fun to peek through the glass window and see what flowers they have for that day. Very handy if you intend to just pick up some flowers to decorate your home or get a bouquet for that special someone after a meal here. 3. Furniture store Knots is also a furniture store! Everything you see, even the chair u sit on is for sale. Who knows? I may just decide to buy one one of these days. I was really quite taken with the round wooden table and chairs we sat on during yesterday's dinner. Let me think about it lol #wink4. FoodUnfortunately, this cafe really needs to do much better when it comes to their food. Last night was my 3rd visit and I must say I was pleasantly surprised that the dinner we had was much much better than the ones I had with my friends in the first two visits.5. Reasonable price (value for money)Fortunately, the prices at Knots are really reasonable. Our dinner last night set us back around $35 for our 2 mains. That's really ok by SG standards where foods in many similar cafes can be quite expensive. So, for all the reasons above, I will keep coming back to Knots Cafe in the years to come. If only they improve on their food quality, I will happily write a new review and change my rating to 5 stars. Review 11/50 of 2017 reviews"

It is in a small corner near the tonic shop and NTUC.Dian Xiao Er has private rooms like this, which I had the tasting session in, it provides a lot of privacy. Additionally, they have rooms to accommodate up to 40pax, so be sure that Dian Xiao Er can accommodate your extended family.1. Prosperity Salmon Yu ShengThe first dish of the food tasting was the yu sheng, along with oil and plum sauce, it was a very savoury dish. It can be purchased at an ala carte price of $42.80++. Lou Hei! The salmon in this dish was Norwegian smoked salmon, as such, it adds a salty touch to the sweetness of the plum sauce. 2. Shark's Fin Broth with Crab Meat & ConpoyThe Shark's fin was very flavourful and yet not salty. Customers can also request this dish to be switched to a more environmentally friendly fish maw. You can definitely taste the shreds of crab meat in this broth, and even without vinegar, it was a very hearty dish.3. Signature Herbal Roast Duck with 3 Flavours (Angelica Herb, Ten Wonders, Wild Ginseng)I had never seen a more shiny roast duck skin before, I could tell immediately that this was going to be the best roast duck I have ever eaten. The skin was so crispy, almost like a flaky croissant and the meat was succulent and juicy!Signature Herbal Roast Duck with 3 Flavours (Angelica Herb, Ten Wonders, Wild Ginseng)The duck was roasted with the herbs inside the duck and the herbs are then extracted and used to brew the herbal sauces. So if you order a ten wonders duck, it would be stuffed with ten wonders spices and then served with the ten wonders sauce. Typically, the sauce is poured over the duck, which might result with crispy duck skin becoming soggy. Joanne, the Dian Xiao Er representative also mentioned that you can request for the duck and sauce to be served separately.The Angelica Herb was said to be the least ""strongest"" herb, so I tried it and indeed it wasn't as strong as the other two sauces. The ten wonders herb was the next sauce I tried next and I liked it the best. The wild ginseng sauce definitely was pure ginseng with wolfberries. I didn't quite like the ginseng sauce as it really washed out the taste of the duck. I would recommend first timers to try the ten wonders duck with the ten wonders sauce.4. Sauteed Baby Lobsters with Pumpkin SauceThis was a new dish to my taste buds. I love lobsters and these baby lobsters definitely met my expectations of freshness. They came right off the shell with my chopsticks, so it's pretty easy to eat them. Do note, that this dish is cooked with curry leaves, coconut and chilli padi, so it can be a abit spicy. You can however request for the spiciness to be toned down to suit your taste. The sauce itself tasted strongly of salted egg, I couldn't actually taste the pumpkin in the sauce. It is a sweet and tangy sauce with a tinge of spiciness. But as I ate my second baby lobster, I started to realize that the spiciness increases exponentially. For this dish, Dian Xiao Er will serve the number of baby lobster of 2-3 pieces per pax. 5. Prosperous Braised TrottersThe braised trotters were very soft and tender, pretty sure you don't need teeth for this dish. There are also fried oysters in this dish, which I found very generous of them. The broccoli wasn't hard as I had expected it to be, it was pretty soft. For most dishes with oyster sauces, I usually feel quite thirsty after eating it, but it wasn't the case with this dish. 6. HongKong Style Chinese PomfretProbably the biggest pomfret I have ever seen, but even though I couldn't taste the fishiness at the begining, I realized that I could smell the fishiness of this fish at the end. Nonetheless for a group of 10, we managed to conquer one side of the fish and then, for second helpings, we flipped the fish over. This should give you an understanding of how big the fish is, since my photo does no justice to it. Joanne explained that this was a top grade pomfret that is steamed with shallots, ginger and spring onion.7. Luxurious Abalone Treasure PotWhen this dish was served up to our table, everyone pretty much was amazed, at the ""treasure"" in this dish! This dish is normally served in a claypot, but to show the extent of the treasure, for this food tasting session, Dian Xiao Er served it on a plate. The sea cucumber was slightly harder than expected, the fish maw was very soft and almost gelatinous in texture. 8. D-Boiled Hashima It was a subtly sweet cold dessert which was a very refreshing end to the hearty family style meal. The hashima was boiled with rock sugar and red dates."

Been a returning customer for over 5 years now since before they shifted to their current location. The boss of the restaurant is also the chef, though he is a local, but he stayed and studied in Italy for many years. This is evident in his cooking that has an authentic Italian taste.Over the years I've eaten here, I've stuck to a few tried and tested dishes. The first is the Tomato Seafood Soup, a delicious Tomato Soup with a rich taste of fresh tomatoes combined with the fresh garlic and herbs in the soup that makes it a wonderful concotion combined with a few prawns, calamari and a mussel. It is definitely worth is $6 price tag with its fresh ingredients.The second is the Spaghetti Alla Romano, which is a delicious spaghetti with a tomato cream sauce that is the signature dish of the restaurant. The pasta is always cooked al dente, and the tomato cream sauce is extremely tasty and light. The dish is also topped off with a generous serving of prawns.The third is the pizza, I've tried various types but particularly love the classic Hawaiian and Pepperoni Pizzas. The dough used is freshly made and you can taste the yeast in it, putting the dough used by Pizza chains to shame. The crust is light and extremely crispy but not too thin making it the perfect mix of crispyness and ""heavyness"". The ingredients on top are also fresh and the cheese is wonderful.Overall I definitely feel that its one of the best Italian restaurants I've eaten though criminally underrated as its usually pretty empty. The decoration in the restaurant is pretty nice with a cosy rustic feel. The staff are also friendly and helpful. The drinks like Iced Lemon Tea and Soft Drinks are also free flow, making it popular with the kids."

This place is a family-run Italian restaurant that serves up very good food. However, there seemed to be a lack of service staff so we had to wait quite a while to get served. But on to the food.We found the interior to be cosy and simple, which is perfect for casual dining. We saw a few other families here as well. You can find the usual Italian fare here, such as pastas, pizzas, mains and tiramisu. The pasta is quite reasonably priced at $8.90+, and the mains cost on average 15, which I feel was value for money considering the sizable servings. I particularly liked the chicken breast coated with thin parmesan crumbs and served with creamy capers sauce. The chicken breast was quite tender and juicy, and the sauce was amazingly smooth and went really well with the chicken.Overall, this is a good place to enjoy some very good Italian food in a very relaxed atmosphere."

Nestled in the cosy Casurina neighbourhood between prata and tze char stores, this Japanese eatery is one of those places that people who live around the area (like me) swear by. Dining here is kind of like being invited to someone's house. The menu is simple - just laminated pieces of paper with handwritten prices, which I find adorable. I usually rotate around these few choices: potato salad, potato croquette, katsu don and chicken udon. I love the Japanese style potato salad that includes corn and carrots, and the croquette that is crispy on the outside and soft, mushy and delicious on the inside. The katsu don and chicken udon are by no means top notch, but are good enough to satisfy my random Japanese food cravings in the middle of the week. Most items on the menu are priced at less than $10!"

And recipes passed down from his mother. But what sold me was the panna cotta, it's superb and one of the best I'd had in Singapore. Located at the corner end of shophouses in Serangoon Gardens opposite Chomp Chomp, you enter into a 'magical' place filled with plants. Fortunately I'd called ahead to make a reservation (which is not my usual practice) so we had our table for two when we arrived 10 minutes later. Notorious for lack of parking, we found a lot right in front of the restaurant, probably due to COVID-19 and polling day! The menu was pretty extensive and varied so we took a while to decide, although the server was also good with recommendations since it was our first visit. There's also a good list of cocktails and I'd have ordered a drink if I wasn't driving! We loved the calamari and shrimps which were lightly battered and fried to perfection. The lobster and crab ravioli was a smaller portion than I'd expected while the crab fettuccine was pretty good. The panna cotta is a must have. This distinguishes an Italian restaurant from being so so to really really good in my view! Looks like I will have to return to try the tiramisu next."

However it has a loyal following due to its quality. The dry version is not the sticky gluey kind you might have come to expect. They add a little bit of soup into it so that with the sauce is just right overall. It's one of the most comforting beef noodles she's ever had, my wife said. For the soup version, it's pretty standard. There's a generous portion of beef. The noodles is harder than usual and quite chewy. The hawker seems to only dip the noodles into hot water for a few seconds, lift it out, repeat once more, and then serve. That explains the texture of the noodles. I think it'll be better to try the dry version rather than the soup version for a first time experience."

It wasn't closed! Joy.Reviewing the beef kway teow. These are my favourite beef noodles in Singapore. I find that the portions have grown smaller since they moved, but I can't complain because it's still good. You can have beef tendons, mix, all lean meat, you get the idea. Just ask. It's usually like that, but they're nice about it. The sauce is so thick and delish, though you can throw the soup on top if you want (my sister does that). The chilli is great too. Noodles have just the right bite, not too soft or hard. You can ask for more soup. It's very good, the beef taste is strong, but without the weird edge that usually comes with beef soup. I think they changed the preserved veg they use though. It's definitely different from the old one, which was better, and less sweet. Still, way better than other beef noodles. I can't help but compare every other bowl of beef noodle I try to this, and nothing compares. That said, there are different types of beef noodles, but to each their own.Still, every bite is great, even till the last. You don't get sick of it. I always wish I had more at the end.They also have some beef laksa thing, but I'm not a fan of that. Then again, I've never actually ordered, just tried some out of someone's bowl to see if I would."

The sourdough was soft which I like best.White Cold Brew (S$7+)Recommended to have the drink  without ice cubes so that one can taste the chocolatey notes more easily. Although it was non sweeten, it was not bitter in taste.Overall the food was not bad. The crowd started to come in at around 9am, so best came early."

When I entered I was a bit wary as the place oozes a hipster atmosphere which to me often translates into average quality food against a premium price, you pay for the stylish environment, not for the food: WRONG, this is not what Atlas is about! The food is great and the price point is more than acceptable.Atmosphere: as mentioned this place has a relaxing hipster vibe, it's very instagram worthy, I am not a good photographer so I did not capture this in my pictures but google some pictures and you'll see what I mean. The service is friendly and punctual.Food: The menu had many interesting and healthy looking dishes but I decided to go for a brunch-style dish, I had the Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough  with scrambled eggs and Italian pork sausages. This could potentially go wrong in so many ways: chewy canned mushrooms, overcooked scrambled eggs and dry sausages but it was fantastic! The creamed shimeiji mushrooms are tasty, they provide a nice touch of unami to the dish and the sausages are juicy but the real stars are the sourdough and the scrambled eggs. The sourdough toast was perfect: good crust and one of the better tasting breads I had here in Singapore, the eggs were fluffy and light yet creamy, yum!Food part II: since I was hungry and greedy, we ordered next to our main dish a Maple Strawberry Pancake to share between two people. Once I had the Mushrooms & eggs on toast, I kinda regretted I'd ordered more as I was quite full and more than satisfied. More so, when the pancake arrived I feared it would be dry and bland as it looked thick. Wong again!! Whilst we both just really enjoyed our mains, we wolfed down the pancake like we hadn't eaten in ages! It is really delicious, the combo of fresh strawberries and the moist pancake is just great. The people next to us ordered the Caramelized banana pancakes with ice cream which looked absolutely delicious too (but I don't eat bananas so not for me).Price: I was pleasantly surprised to learn that our total check for two coffees and three mains (two savory dishes and one sweet to share) was similar to what I am used to pay for a typical weekend brunch for two in this neighborhood (around 50$). Prices are nett here, GST and service charge included. Additionally, they offer large jugs of ice water without charge!I'm coming again? 100% sure, their counter had cupcakes and cheese cake which looked very tempting and the I can see myself craving their dishes in the future! Since it is a new opening I hope they can keep this standard up."

The flakes of cheese scattered on top of the fries is delicious! I also like how there are window seats and plenty of sunlight comes into the cafe. Their black, matte, industrial-looking stools are also surprisingly, quite comfy. And if you're a fan of white marble tables, there are plenty of those in this cafe. Their service also isn't too shabby.Finally, their peppermint tea tastes superb, so do give it a try! Cons: The truffle fries are a little on the greasy side, and I found this to be the case on both my first and second visit to Atlas Coffeehouse. On my second visit, the fries definitely tasted hard and crusty. I'm however, still a loyalist to PS. Cafe's truffle fries, as they are more consistent and fresh, as compared to Atlas Coffeehouse's. The cafe is quite popular and can get quite crowded, even on weekday afternoons."

Had the signature mushroom on toast here and it did not disappoint. I got a huge slice of sourdough bread with an overflow of mushroom in white wine cream sauce topped with parmesan cheese. The dish was creamy, rich and delicious. The mushroom texture really goes well with the texture and creaminess of the sauce. While it could easily be too rich / heavy to be enjoyable beyond a few bites, this wasn't the case. I managed to finish the whole dish despite not being a fan of super creamy stuff. The only letdown is probably the bread which was a bit chewy to begin with and gets worse over time as it becomes too soggy from the creaminess of the mushroom. My friend had their other famous dish - the pancake - which was fluffy and as sinfully good. Would recommend checking it out."

We liked everything we ordered (waffles, avocado and greens and roasted chicken, croissant, flat white.) but the service could be significantly improved. One of the waiters came to tell us our roasted chicken would take 20 minutes and asked us if we would like it with the avocado or later. We said we could just get the avocado first. However, the chicken took so long that we had finished everything and were still just sitting there waiting for the chicken to come out. There were lots of customers waiting outside so the other waitresses came ""thrice"" to clean our plates and attempted to take our table holder away. Clearly bad communication among the staff."

They had a large range of coffee so it was a pity we all had the same thing. Also a point of note, free water. I had the salmon soba noodles which came with glazed salmon and a fried egg.

Make your order at the cashier when you've decided but otherwise, don't bother with self-service. The servers don't get too pleased when you try to help yourself. Several notable items I've tried:Nitro brew - not too acidic, smooth, good for patrons who enjoy coffee but have gastric problemsBerries waffle - love love love this. Great crisp and chew to waffle. Berries compote is a great balance of sour and sweet. Definitely a YES. Banana pancake - it's more like a sponge cake than pancake. The cornflakes are awesome but why are they soaked in syrup? The dish was too sweet for me. Hash - excuse me this is mashed potato not hash. Hash needs to cast iron pan to get its crust there's no crust in this hash. Flavors wise it was not bad. The sausage was delicious! Scrambled eggs - just get it! Great moist and delicious. Huge portion! Truffle fries - thin crispy fries with generous serving of Parmesan cheese. No truffle taste though.

Worth mentioning is that it shares the space with a pizza place so in the evenings it transforms into a pizza place. Never tried the pizzas there but it does make the setting feel a bit strange but nice with some variety from all the other similarly looking places."

Well I must say that Instagram has been most helpful in keeping me updated with the prettiest cafés on the block and that kinda led me to One Man Coffee, a hole in the wall that shares their shop front with Crust gourmet Pizza Bar along Upper Thomson Road. Sip on the Melbournian Axil Coffee Roaster beans pulled by Sarah Jane (formerly from Immigrants) or E-gene (who pulled his way around MEL). Coffee is little acidic with medium finish. My latte wasn't quite full bodied or milky though. While it's not quite my style, it was sufficient in packing a punch to last me through my afternoon meeting. Coffee is priced between $3 to $6.50. OMC also stocks B.A.O's pastries. I simply love Christophe's croissants, well the French makes the best croissants! The Chocolate pain is also amazing. Get them to heat it up for that crispy flakiness. Better still, have them with honey ham and melted cheese ($6). Cakes are also available and I was seduced by a Salted Caramel Banana Cake.For something a little more than sweets, OMC does all-day-breakfast with a lean but mean menu, all of which come out of a pizza oven! Talk about easy to make but delicious food here! Love the description of the Gashouse Egg aka Toad in hole aka Egg-in-the-bread-with-the-hole-in-the-middle ($10). It's more of a snack I feel. I really do have a monster appetite for breakfast food. The dish is really simple, they really do just make a hole in the fluffy brioche, crack an egg in, top with cheese and into the oven it goes. Almost a croque madame.Really there's no need to be fancy for brekkie when the ingredients are good (hello ooooozy yolk). What's special is that bacon jam which is smoky, meaty and sweet. I could do with a thick layer of that in the toast anytime. Satisfying flavors, a little dry on the edges, not so satisfying portion but that helps save space for other food. The Broiche French Toast ($10) is another popular item and it looked freaking amazing with the homemade berry compote, candied walnuts and fresh cream. Of course the dust of sugary white completes the instagram worthy picture. OMC is a great alternative to the super packed Habitat Coffee which I failed to visit TWICE! Well I guess I'll just have to explore the rest of the Thomson cafés until Habitat becomes less crowded. Anyhoo, great vibe at One Man Coffee but do go early or be prepared to wait as well due to the extremely small space."

Granted it was a Saturday afternoon and from what I've heard (they're always packed), I felt that it should have been made clear that there was a waiting list for seating. Numerous parties after me all sat down at the same seats and were told of their policy and had to get up soon after. Would slapping a reserve sign on the table be so hard? On to coffee, we had a cappuccino and long black, the milk wasn't frothed well, and the long black was just the darkest point of my life to say the least. Last but not least, everyone around was ordering the french toast, so maybe you might have better luck with that than the coffee?"

This one is over rated. Let's talk about what's good. Prawn paste chicken is pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. The dish came out piping hot, and a bite into the crispy wing reveals moist juciy meat, slight oil can be seen flowing out between those muscles. Cooked just right. The skin is lightly battered and crunchy crisp. The taste is obviously prawn paste, but it's just a tad light. Maybe some customer like it, I prefer more oomph.Balacan kang kong. The balacan is very good. Just enough pungent, bits of shrimps, brings out the softness of those leaves. The stalks, however, is too hard. Some might say crunchy, probably, but they could have cooked it slightly longer and still come out crunchy. The chef can cook the stalks first and let the steam cook it under cover for a minute or two longer, then dump the rest of the leaves into the wok to stir. That way the stalks will be less hard, and the leaves will s be perfect. Yes. I am picky.The seafood yee mee (brown noodles) is a disappointment. The noodles is chewy, the squid is chewy, the fish is decently fresh, but those soda-water soaked prawns looks so good that it actually taste bland. On the whole, it's the blandness of the brown sauce on the noodles. Probably forgotten to add salt, or msg, or both, or even a tad bit of artificial flavouring could have save it from such a disappointment. Alas.These three dishes is those standard Zhi Char dishes that almost everybody gets it right. Someone dropped the ball this time. Maybe its a different chef, maybe this chef has a lousy day, whatever.Average out a three stars from me @$30.50."

Super authentic, mouthwateringly delicious and incredibly reasonable, I don't know what more you could possibly ask for. I have been coming here for years and often crave it when I'm back in LA. Sure, Singapore is full of delicious Chinese food - we are, after all, a food hub. However, every dish here is cooked to perfection... and that's what sets Hong Kong Street apart from other Cantonese restaurants, in my opinion.There are so many yummy dishes here, I go through phases of ""favorites"". My current favorite? The Pa Ting Yu (Steamed Silver Catfish - I ask for mine with their black bean sauce)... Firstly, the fish is steamed to perfection (moist, melt-in-your-mouth goodness). Secondly, the sauce is on point. (I tend to steer away from Black Bean sauces because of how salty it usually is) However, this one is anything but! You can tell they make their own sauces (or at least that's what it tastes like), not something out of the bottle. Bursting with flavor, yet, not salty at all. Another dish I like is their Sum Lor Hor Fun (Sliced Fish Hor Fun) which, if you aren't familiar, is stir fried flat rice noodles with bean sprouts and sliced fish in gravy. Not soupy, but not dry noodles either. It isn't, however, the black singaporean Hor Fun you might be used to. (I like this one because I feel like it's healthier than normal Hor Fun - whether or not it actually is, might be another story haha) A few other favorites include the Milky Fish Noodle Soup, Salted Fish Fried Rice, Prawn Paste Chicken, Deep Fried Cereal Prawns, Pork Ribs... The place is clean with air-conditioning and the service is good. However, I tend to always take my food to go (maybe I just like eating in the comfort of my home haha) But we usually buy a bunch of dishes from here to-go for dinner when we're too lazy to cook (or have guests over)... Just call ahead and they'll have it ready for you to pick it."

Spam Waffle (S$12)Home-made bamboo charcoal waffle with spam & gruyere cheese, butter scrambled eggs, baked beans, sour creamThe cafe was well known for its waffles and recently it came out with its first savoury version of waffle. The cafe had added charcoal to the waffle, not only because it was different from the waffle, but also charcoal was good for health too. Cut through the black colored looking waffle, one was able to see chunks of spam and cheese inside. The waffle was light and crispy, with the yummy fragrant of the cheese, savoury additive taste of the spam and finished off with lingering taste of the cheese.If you like desserts, don't forget to check out its dessert display counter which changes its special items every wednesday. Mango Panna Cotta ($4.50)It was one the dessert special items. Served in a flute glass, and topped with a flower on top. Rich creamy mango flavour, topped with crumbles and crispy pops.I finished the meal with a cup of Latte ($4.50) which was rich and fragrant. Peaked one up to be ready for work.Please take at the moment only cash was accepted as the NETS and credit card machine was down. There was no GST or service charge.

Back at their Toa Payoh outlet, they served waffles, of the same flavours but the presentation wasn't as pretty as they are now. The location here at Upper Thomson faces the main road, but it is also hidden at the edge road near the soya bean store. It is difficult to find parking at this dead end, so I recommend you find parking at the multi-storey hdb parking behind Les Patisseries. This new chic and urban looking Les Patisseries seats a lot customers than their tiny Toa Payoh outlet and they open till 2am on weekends, but the kitchen closes around 930pm, but hey! waffles at 1am, go on down to Les Patisseries!Taking at look at the menu, it  sure looks like Les Patisseries is a waffle expert, with 10 different types of waffles!!1. Waffle Banoffee - caramelized banana2. Belgium Chocolate - chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce and berries3. Salted Caramel - salted caramel ice cream with salted caramel sauce and berries4. Madagascar Vanilla - vanilla ice cream and vanilla sauce5. Horffles - Horlicks ice cream with horlicks powder and sauce6. Waffles Isaphan - lychee and rose sorbet with rose waffle7. Thai Milk Tea & Earl Grey - thai milk tea ice cream on earl grey waffle with condensed milk8. Chocolate Indulgence - double chocolate chip waffle with chocoate ice cream9. Maple Waffle - maple syrup , salted butter and fresh berries10. Summer Berries Waffle - berries compote, fresh berries and maple syrupWaffles 1-8 come with a macaron and range from $13.90 - $15.90 nett1. Thai Milk Tea & Earl Grey Waffle $15.90This was slightly different from the Thai milk tea ice cream waffle I had at at Toa Payoh, before they moved. Back then, it didn't have an earl grey waffle and was slightly cheaper. The waffles were crisp with a fluffy and slightly airy and cakey texture. The earl grey flavour was subtle but you could taste it in the batter, when eaten alone without the thai milk tea ice cream. The thai milk tea ice cream tasted a bit icy to me. It carried off the aroma of thai milk tea and with the condensed milk topped over it, it was on point!I totally love the presentation of the waffles here. They're a work of art, and dedication to food! I look around and at 9pm on a friday night, almost every table had ordered at least one waffle! The pistachio macaron on the top was kind of tall and small in diameter. It had a crunch into the crust of the macaron and it was beyond expectation. The strawberries and blueberries around the waffle not only enhanced the presentation but it was also a refreshing touch to this sweet delight.This was definitely an improved version of the thai milk tea ice cream waffle I had a year back! Good job upgrading it!2. Waffle Isaphan $15.90The next waffle was the waffle Isaphan, I had also tried this at their previous location and remembered it behind crispy and almost like a toasted bread that became a biscuit. But this was no longer the case! The waffle has a rose (bandung) aroma to it, and the batter carried a mild rose flavour in every bite. The waffle here wasn't as crispy at the earl grey waffle, but it was more moist and slanted to a cake. The colours of the lychee and rose sorbet ice cream were pleasing to the eyes. As both were sorbets, lactose tolerant friend rejoice! These are their only two ice creams made without milk. Both sorbets were refreshing with a floral and fruity note. Texture wise, it wasn't as smooth as I had hoped it to be. The dish was topped off with edible rose petals, ingenious decorations.  This waffle was more towards the sweet side and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth craving.Overall : I am excited to come back and try the remaining 8 waffles here at Les Patisseries, there's something for everyone here! Cakes, Pasta, Truffle fries and 10 different waffles with different waffle batters!"

Workbench has came through throughout the months and they have good cafe food.Had a blueberry cheesecake gelato with waffles which came with little marshmallows. It appears to be nothing out of the ordinary but for the first time in the longest time, the waffle surpassed the gelato with its batter and it wasn't too sweet or 'uncooked' where you can see that it's still flour-y. That's great to hear that the food quality is decent despite the busy Crowd even on a weekday night. It's a small place with indoor and outdoor seating. 3 bus stops away from Amk mrt.There are many cafes out there with extravagant decors and I hope the good ones continue to tweak their menus to attract the crowd. After all, to keep one going back would be foodddd instead of instagramable foods which looks nice on print but not to satisfy our tummies."

I last visited this cafe almost a year ago, when they have a small selection of food and was portrayed to be more of a waffles and ice cream hang out.Their menu offering has doubled with more options to cater to various foodies. BBQ ribs, fish and chips, even salted egg wings. The dessert section with blue velvet waffle caught my eye and I asked the staff what is a blue velvet waffle and she said it was a waffle that was blue in colour! I knew I had to try it!1. Spam Fries $9I love spam fries and this was a pretty huge portion served with parmesan cheese and garlic mayo. The spam fries were sliced to the right thickness and was slightly crisp on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside. Eat them while they're hot. Once they've cooled, they become pretty hard and isn't as enjoyable.2. Matcha Latte $5I liked the latte art on my matcha latte and it wasn't overly sweet. It has subtle bitternotes with each sip. I really enjoyed it. The temperature was just right and I slowly enjoyed this drink throughout my meal.3. Oven baked prawn and cheese pasta $13Looked decent but it didn't taste up to standard. The pasta tasted bland and though they were generous with the prawns. I couldn't quite taste the cheese.5. Salted egg wings $12 *highly recommended*With the salted egg craze all over Singapore, I was still surprised to see salted egg wings here. Unlike a popular salted egg wing shop in timbre+, the wings here were very crispy and definitely exceeded my expectations. They were deep fried to perfection and then submerged in a golden sauce of goodness. The salted egg wasn't over powering or gerlat. Do share this with a couple of people too!6. BBQ Ribs $18BBQ  ribs  I was abit stunned when I saw the portion of the ribs. Huge for $18, but once I grabbed my fork and knife and started to dig in, I was even more stunned when I felt the toughness of the meat. The meat was literally ""glued"" to the bones and it took some effort to get the meat off the bones. The meat was also dry in most areas. In the areas that the meat wasn't so dry, it was at least edible. The fries did way better than the ribs. I polished the fries off the plate! 7. Beer Battered Fish and Chips $13As mentioned in the BBQ ribs, the paprika fries were my favourite but the fish and chips here were pretty decent too. Crispy and crunchy beer batter was definitely the highlight of this dish. The fish meat tasted like your typical dory fish meat. But at $13, in a heartland area, I think this cafe still provides decent value to the table.8. Blue velvet waffle with cookies and cream ice cream $9.30Blue  velvet  waffle  with  cookies  and  creamThe blue velvet waffle was indeed blue, but a very dark blue. It gave me the impression that it was a charcoal waffle! Served with caramel sauce, the cookies and cream was okay. It was creamy but could've been smoother in texture.The waffle itself was very dense and cakey. I'm a crispy waffle lover so this wasn't the waffle for me. My friends however finished it off in minutes! Overall : This cafe does try hard to meet the cafe hopper experience. It has reasonably priced and for people living around the area, grabbing a weekend brunch would be ideal at workbench bistro. Nice, chill out ambience also helps you take your mind off the misses of some of the food here."

Remember to collect the cutlery and condiments at the counter after making payment. Cash, NETS, and credit cards were accepted as payment here.Salted Egg Chicken Pasta ($15)Linguine with grilled chicken tossed in raw salted egg, curry leaves and chilli padi.The pasta was a bit too overcooked and was too mushy in texture. the salted egg was rich and thick but a bit too bland itself. The grilled chicken was well flavoured and seem to overpowered the salted egg flavour.Blue Velvet Waffle with Ice-Cream ($8.80 classic/ $9.50 premium)I had it served with Earl Grey with Fig ice-cream and topped with maple syrup. I remember the staff told me that ice-cream without ""*"" on the tag was considered classic and Earl Grey with Fig was one of those, yet I was charged $9.50 for it. Interestingly the waffle looked more green than blue when served. Maybe it should have been called green velvet waffle. The waffle was crispy on the outside but had a dense and chewy texture inside. Not the airy light type which I preferred. Compared to my last visit, the place looked much crowded than before, even on a weekday night. Maybe because the menu had gone through a change with much interesting items onboard."

Given its kinda obscure location, it's probably heavily reliant on the residents living within the area, students and the cafe-hoppers. They offer the usual coffee selections and a small list of bites such as waffles and pastries. Affordable pricing for a cafe of such size and location, but still a premium when compared against the next door kopitiam. We went for the waffles with ice cream which if I didn't recall wrongly was $7.5. Placed the order and paid at the counter before we got ourselves seated, the waffles was served to us.

I had waited quite long for the dessert to be served. Seem that the kitchen could not handle the load. When the dessert was finally served, I was disappointed to find that the scoops of ice cream were all melted. I almost wanted to ask for a replacement. As I did not tend to wait any longer, so I did not ask for a replacement. The brownie was soft and moist.The set lunch was served with a cup of coffee or tea. But I had top up $1 to upgrade the drink to a hot chocolate. It tasted not bad although I would prefer a richer one.I was surprised to be presented with the bill without asking. Kind of being pressured to leave the restaurant. Maybe they need the table as the restaurant was packed that day."

It is very spacious and strangely, it can get quite cold in here. This is the menu for the day, pick an entree, a main, for $1 top up you can pick any of the hot drinks on the right column.1. Citrus Cured Salmon SaladI loved the pomegranate seeds, they were sweet! The salmon tasted fresh and it melted in my mouth! Overall a great way to start my lunch!2. Parmesan-crusted Veal ScaloppiniI loved the crust and it went well with the tomato sauce. The ravioli was filled with cheesey goodness and it was hot. The asparagus was bit too stiff for my liking. The veal strangely tasted more like chicken. All mains came with tumeric-infused rice with raisins, I couldn't really taste the tumeric, but the raisins were big and sweet and it added flavour to the rice.3. Vanilla Creme BruleeCreme Brulees from L'rez never fail to amaze me. It is always cooked to perfection! The ice cream on top isn't too sweet, and the crust is just thin enough for you to break it with your tea spoon. It was sweet, smooth and superb all the way through the bottom of the dish! Perfect ending to a perfect fine dining lunch set!The cappucino and mocha were nicely presented but both lacked flavour. Tasted more like an instant coffee with too much water. All in all, every meal at L'rez has always ended on a high note and I would love to come back to see what else these NYP students have in store for our tummies!"

The restaurant is nothing glamourous. Plastic chairs and tables outside the typical shop front that houses a few restaurants. We were a party of 10 - and yes, I am related to all of them (apart from my cousins boyfriend but he'll be part of the family soon enough) and we fit nicely around the round table where we laughed and chatted. My aunty did the ordering and she did well. We were sold on the restaurant by ""crab beehoon"" - so that was the first thing we ordered. The crab was fresh and the sauce flavoursome. However, the gravy was mostly at the bottom so we had to mix it up ourselves. My top two dishes were the chicken and the ngohiang. The chicken ... SOOOOO TENDER, crispy skin and topped with the crunchy crunchy onions I just can't get enough of. The ngohiang was flavourful of pork, crab and waterchestnuts added for crunch. Fried to perfection and served with a sweet dipping sauce. We also had a steamed crab, because hey - a family of 10 can't just have one crab! Razor clams (err delicious), tofu (yum), baby spinach (yum) and venison (didn't try as I'm not a big fan in general). We walked away absolutely stuffed. Definitely go here for local flavours and casual dining!"
