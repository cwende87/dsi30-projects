I thought we were going to take the shuttle to the Heartland Mall (Kovan MRT station) to have lunch then go to this chocolate factory that the folks here keep mentioning but Sheng Teck took us to a new spot to eat, directly across from this chocolate factory. It was like all the other hawker centers I have been to but somewhat cleaner. As always, I find myself pondering what to eat every time because there are so many choices. Luckily, we found a table so I suggested for the 2 guys to grab their food first whilst I hold the table. Little did I know, I did not have to order any food for myself. As I was in line for some rice, roasted pork and char siu, Sheng Teck came up to me to tell me that he ordered enough food for him and I. Awwww, right? That guy literally stole my heart. + the rice was fluffy + portions are quite generous + the roasted pork was super tender + the BBQ pork was succulent + the roasted chicken melted in my mouth He also ordered something else for Jerry and I to try. I had no clue what it was but I tried it and feel like I deserve a medal for trying something I definitely was hesitant about, haha. The food was great. The best was my company. Both guys have a very special place in my heart. Thanks to this trip. I am so grateful. Thank you for treating, Sheng Teck :)"

The menu is filled with lots of hearty German fare, from sausages to schnitzel. We split a garlic sausage with sauerkraut and potato salad, and we were impressed! The sausage was juicy, and the sauerkraut complemented the creaminess of the potato salad.I was a little surprised that they didn't offer any soft pretzels as an option for appetizers; if they could do that I think it would make this place even better.

However the order was served with spaghetti by a apologetic staff saying they had no fettucini. Not too impressed with such poor service as they should ask customer first before preparing the meal. Too hungry to reject the order and wait for them to prepare something else so i took it  The mushrooms are not fresh mushroom but are instead canned button mushrooms. Beef is overcooked and tough. The sauce was salty but its expected cos its cheese.  I will stick to pies and pastries if i patronise them again the next time

I have to say my father has great taste (not only in finding a wife) - this is DA BEST fish-head steamboat in Singapore. Regardless of your choice of white pomfret or the red grouper, the pre-fried fish is always succulent and fresh, cooked to perfection in the full-flavoured soup. I remember as a kid I liked to select the half-soggy yam pieces from the soup, those were my favourite. The tofu prawn is a recommended side order. Its sauce is a different take with a little bit of spice, but it helps the rice to go down really well.Many people are willing to wait for these piping pots of steamy goodness, that's why we always make it a point to reach before dinner time.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews."

I have to say that that's pretty good for any country standards.Although the place says that it's a tapas bar, there is a fairly limited tapas menu, and not that exciting. But I have to say that the fried risotto is pretty fabulous. Their normal food menu, which are all full sized dishes, are all good. The pasta dishes are well cooked and are tasty. The pizza is a bit on the dry side, but good. This is really the place to come if you want to share a bottle of wine with your friends (or maybe just with yourself.)

So, look out for these offers if you're in an economical state of mind.

It has a really nice menu with decent food and wine at reasonable prices, which is a recipe for success in an area like Katong/Joo Chiat. It's flabbergasting how many other similar venues failed in this neighborhood because they didn't get the price/quality balance right, and Wine Connection has to be commended for not assuming that just because there's more expats living here, there's a market for European food at 30+ dollars a dish, and wine at 15+ dollars a glass.They do a lot of things right, from, again, reasonable prices for reasonable food and wine, to a pretty well done interior that gives the right ambiance, to - finally - reasonably late opening hours, something unheard of in this still pathetically early closing neighbourhood! Yes everyone else on east coast road and Joo Chiat, are you listening? If you want to ever become the Holland Village of the east, last order at 9:30 won't cut it.Now, to my biggest, and only issue with Wine Connection, which is a total deal breaker: the noise. This place is popular, and generally quite full, and the interior architect who was responsible for making this place look trendy-hip seems to have gone to great lengths to carefully choose materials that are sure to create the absolute maximum possible reverb, with everyone's voices bouncing off tiled floor, glass/concrete walls, making this place about as loud as the runway at Changi. Having dinner with spouse becomes an eternal 'say again' match, unless you're willing to join in with everyone else and scream your voice hoarse.Wine Connection would be an easy 4 star, but unless the noise is addressed - and it's not so hard, use fabric on the ceiling and it will be much better - it's a 3."

Giving it 4 stars for the following reasons:1. Food quality: They are well known for their tonkatsu sets and they don't disappoint. Their tonkatsu sets are delicious and one of the better ones that you can find in SG. Love their black and white sesame seeds which I always have fun grounding into powder form. Add some yuzu sauce to the grounded sesame and it becomes a perfect dip for the katsu, enhancing its taste tremendously. The tartar sauce that they serve is also really delicious and they will readily give you 2nd helpings if you ask for them.2. Free flow of shredded Cabbage: They are very generous with their shredded cabbage and the wait staff will come round to top up for you again and again. Gotta ask them to stop as one just cannot eat that much cabbage. The sesame and yuzu sauce go very well with the cabbage, making it a really refreshing side dish which helps to balance the taste of the meat dishes.3. Service: Service is friendly, adequate and pretty efficient. Probably a 3.5 stars for service overall.4. People Watching and Admiring Art in motion: The seats are comfortable, especially when you can get the booth seats. If you are seated at the booth seats, you can have a meal while enjoying the action - watching folks checking in at the airline counters at the departure hall below. I always try to get the booth seats and have been lucky to get them in all my past visits. It is also really fun to watch the very impressive art installation Kinetic Rain while dining here.Really into sake (especially hot sake) recently. So, would definitely be returning to Saboten to satisfy my cravings for hot sake and mouth-watering tonkatsu quite soon."

I ordered the pork loin on rice curry set. The panko on the pork and the pork itself were cooked really well. It was nice and crispy on the outside with a perfect color and the pork was nice and juicy and not at all oily. The curry was an average mild curry. I wish there was an option for a hot/spicy curry.

I headed down for dinner with the family and ordered more dishes to try.For starters, their ebi is still good at this branch. In fact, so good that my mum had seconds. I like that their prawns was melt in your mouth which adds a nice balance to the crispy batter. The tonkatsu was less than fantastic at this branch which is quite a shame since that was what I really raved about. The bits of oily skin inside which made it rather gross. I thought the one at Millenia Walk was done better with firmer meat to batter ratio and no skin in the cutlet. Tried the mentai cutlet, thought that was okay, nothing to write home about so stick to their original sets. The rice was fluffy and fragrant with fresh shredded cabbages that I love to pair with their sesame sauce. Icecream was the same though in a smaller scoop but that's no biggie. Service is just as polite but I just wished it was easier to get their attention since the service at Milennia Walk's branch was outstanding.

If you like it slightly wet, stocked in rich stock, this Hokkien Mee will work for you. I liked that they pair the yellow noodles with thin vermicelli (most places use thick vermicelli). You get more flavour and less starchy, plus the dish does not dry up as easily and you can enjoy the rich prawn broth with every bite! All the seafood added into the dish was cooked for the right bite so you don't have to worry about rubbery seafood.This is good even for takeaway, the Hokkien Mee stays wet from the rich broth."

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.A must dish is the local meal called ""Oluak"" aka oyster omelette from Green Sky food stall, which is one of the best you'll have in the whole of Singapore for my liking, which not only has generous servings of oysters but also their unique way of cooking it up and the textures are very different that the run of the mill ones, in that it's super crispy and crunchy.From the same stall, you can get a pretty good Char Kway Teow which is usually some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and although it wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.The usual satay store that we frequent was sold out by the time we arrived but the one we ate at Stall 11 Ayam Penyet (which translates to ""flat chicken"") didn't disappoint either and the mutton was full of flavour and and these segments of fat that were sweet and so more-ish. If you don't like fat, pass the satay stick on to someone that does. The sauce was nice too but like it's hard to find a bad pizza or bagel in New York, the same can be said for satay but be aware that there are many variations, depending upon the specific influences and regions grounding the chef.For dessert we had our traditional fare of Ais Kacang aka Ice Kacang and Cendol. Ice Kacang is basically shaved ice with flavourings of rose syrup and Gula Melaka (palm sugar) and the kacang part which is usually seaweed grass jelly and red beans and inevitably has attap chee or palm seeds and corn adorning the top. When you go to a beverage shop, they will usually serve hot and cold drinks as well as the refreshing ice kacang but it's almost like a Sizzler smorgasbord in that you can pick and choose what goes into your ice kacang. The cendol looks like little green worms but taste far from it and are sweet rice flour noodles coloured an iridescent green and often paired with coconut.Overall it has to be good if we keep going back there. There's definitely better Kway Teow for my tastes in town but the food stalls at Bedok Corner have yet to disappoint."

The Fried Prawn Mee is stewed in a rich stock, and holds a relatively strong taste of lard. Ye Lai Xiang, possibly the most famous stall there, occupies 2 stall spaces.

The brown sauce is not as spicy as I'd like it to be, but, good enough for that shiok factor. The crushed peanuts adds a good texture to this very satisfying dish. 2. Chicken rice at Tong Fong Fatt*I'm a Muslim so I have not eaten much authentic non-halal hainanese chicken rice*I've always preferred the hainanese chicken rice over the Malay chicken rice as the latter tends to be greasy with almost everything fried. This plate of chicken rice from TFF is amazing - rice is fragrant and fluffy, the steamed chicken is soft and succulent (you have a choice of roasted or steamed), the soup is alright and the garlic chilli adds a nice balance to the whole dish."

He was pouring huge pots of drinks while also taking peoples orders which was very mesmerizing and impressive. It wasn't all for show either because the teh was delicious! Actually, everything was good. We got the classics: curry noodles, nasi lemak and kaya toast. The two entrees also came with a slice of cake each so I got the Kaya and kopi flavors. The kaya one was my favorite!! Super thick buttercream and not too sweet. I came back again when flying out of the airport and tried their mee reebus which was also very tasty - it's like curry gravy.

Eating there is also much more peaceful compared to the hubbub of the food court just down the hall.3.5/5 Food: My first time stopping by, I ordered the chicken donburi. It didn't taste anything remotely Japanese. It was more like a bland version of a Hong Kong chicken clay pot dish.My second time, I ordered the sashimi bento box and I liked that so much better. It came with 6 slices of sashimi, rice, miso soup, fruit, okra, and salad. Tbh, not the best sashimi I've had, but it was a simple and filling meal, so I left happy.4/5 Service: Multi-lingual servers who are attentive but not intrusive.Overall, definitely not the best Asian food I've ever had, but for airport food, it's not bad at all."

It worked well with me but may not for others who prefer thicker soups. I also had the Truffle Capellini with organic egg. It was delicious, with the truffle not overwhelming and just right. The egg was a good mix with the capellini. As for my partner, she had the mussels with spicy cream.

Bar Stories deserves a post of it's own - it's one of the most unique and memorable bars that I've visited, in any of the cities that I've lived in. It's sister outlet, Table Manners, has a unique selling point - the creativity of Bar Stories combined with the coffee crafting expertise of Papa Palheta. This would be a potent combination in any part of Singapore, but particularly so in an area that until recently had been starved of quality coffee. As always, I ordered an espresso and a cappuccino, two drinks that tell me a lot about the quality of coffee in any given cafe, bar or restaurant. The espresso shot was thick, with definite hints of citrus. This gave rise to a full bodied aftertaste that lingered long after the last drops of espresso had been gulped down. It seemed thicker and more potent than a regular shot - more akin to a ristretto - this was a shot that was extracted for the correct eighteen to thirty second extraction time. This may seem like a minor point, but it's an important one - it's harder to make bad coffee with a good espresso foundation.The shot had a medium dark crema, which lined the side of the cup. It's interesting to note that a lot of the perceived bitterness in an espresso shot comes from the crema itself. If you carefully scoop the crema from a fresh espresso shot, it should taste extremely tart. Crema which clings to the side of a cup will not impart as much of this sharp flavour to a shot. This was a good shot by any standard, but it would also be a good shot for anyone who has not tried espresso shots before, or for anyone who has been turned off espresso by bad shots in franchise chain cafes.    The cappuccino has a thin layer of foam, closer to that seen on a latte. As a result, the smooth and silky mouthfeel was reduced, making this a lighter cappuccino (I prefer mine stronger), but the quality of the drink was not overly diminished. One issue is that teacups are being used rather than coffee cups - the difference being that tea cups have very thin walls, and as a result, heats dissipates much more quickly (I'm a science geek. I can't help but notice these things). Combined with the overhead fans above, coffees can lose heat quite quickly, and this has a significant effect on the quality of coffee served. It's worth pointing out that coffees in Table Manners are no more expensive than those in franchise chains. Why waste good money on bad coffee when Table Manners has Papa Palheta's beans? However, prices on the take away menu need to be updated. A latte is listed as costing $5, but actually costs $5.90 - this should be an easy thing to fix, but it's still there. Latte art is always a welcome sight, as it tells me that the baristas were trained to a high standard, and trained to care about quality coffee. This is consistent with my comments on the espresso shot being prepared correctly. The light dusting of cocoa powder ensured that little sweetness was imparted, and that the cocoa flavour accentuated rather than dominated the drink.The food menu is worth a mention also - there is a good selection of starters, main courses and deserts, and an interesting menu that allows items to be paired according to the customers preferences. The prices are fair - they are certainly not overpriced - another point in their favour.In a nutshell, the bright young staff at Table Manners are serving up quality coffee, made from quality beans in a quirky and interesting bar and restaurant. Bar Stories younger sibling is already off to a good start....but change the cups and update the prices on the take away menu!"

I ordered the set lunch with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, salad, and strawberry shortcake.When my order arrived, they had given me mushrooms instead of potatoes.  I brought it to the servers attention.  He took my plate away and quickly returned.  They had simply added maybe two spoons worth of mashed potatoes to my plate.  Come on, potatoes are one of the least expensive foods in the world and, after making a mistake on my order, they skimp on them.The fried chicken was pretty good.  It was certainly not the traditional fried chicken that I kind of expected.  It was prepared more like chicken fried steak. It was a large boneless piece of chicken pounded out, breaded and fried.   It was nothing to write home about but I liked it.tinyurl.com/93wn6a2The strawberry shortcake was a fresh, light, and refreshing dessert.tinyurl.com/96shz52Overall, this is a basic place.  It is much like the restaurants next to it (Moa and Lavaedge).  It is not an inexpensive lunch.  But, it doesn't empty your wallet either.  Out of convenience (close to work), I might go back.  However, it is definitely not a place to venture out of your way to visit."

I almost lost my way in the mall while trying to locate TM. Without any visible signage and especially difficult when the mall has quite a number of small exits around. I don't seem to be able to spot the restaurant until I reached the open space - a small garden-like area. There, I saw a black outdoor gazebo dining area with an open counter featuring a prominent ""pigeon-hole"" backdrop. I knew I have found it and walk right up. I was greeted by a zealous wait staff at the door, who explained the ordering instructions patiently and thereafter showed me to the indoor seats.Entering the dining hall, it is the democratic design that I saw. I could imagine how the people behind TM conceptualized the area, decking out in modernistic Scandinavia-inspired furniture characterized by simplicity and practicality. The ""piecemeal"" communal table stood out from the space, without looking cluttered. The area was highlighted by the wall shelving with potted plants, retail pieces stuffed in each pigeon holes. Fitted mostly in pressed wood, the room was made less formal with a sense of nature integration. The first thing that comes to mind is Ikea, this group of Swedish makes really sensible tools with a small price tag.Lunch is served in a mix-and-match manner, where it comes with 4 main categories; ""fibers"" - Staples & Vegetables, ""protein"" - Seafood & Meat. You can choose to have the lightest meal with 3 fibers for $9.50 or the hearty combination of 2 fiber and 2 protein for $19.00. of course, if these ain't going to fill you, get some add-ons and pay additional $3.50 - $7.50. I customized my plate with a mid-sized combo plus 1 add-on & a dessert to end the meal.The lightly salted Truffle fries are so addictive that I can't stop but emptied the bowl within a short 10 minutes. Each string was deep fried to crisp and I liked the fact that they are cut fatter than any shoe-strings yet sliced slimmer than the regular straight fries. Smell of comfort, less gasoline taste - a great snack packed in umami-rich aromas. Go for potato wedges if truffle fries seem less idolizing.The Chopped Pumpkin Salad came with a decent portion of fresh greens. Never mind if the diced pumpkin looks miserable, a generous toss of that tangy salad dressing add scores to the boring greens. I was looking for a sweet flavour in the pumpkin but the morsels were too tiny to taste.The Cajun seasoning lends a sweet and spicy scent to the sizable chicken thigh. One incision and you witnessed how moist and tender the meat was roasted, with the bursting juices oozing out onto the plate. It was quite close to what I have eaten at Amuse, a delicious piece of bird meat. Other ""protein"" like beef stroganoff, pork cutlet, pesto fish fillet and burger steak, are available as well. There's nothing you won't choose.That additional fiber I had - Spaghetti Pomodoro akin tomato sauce was equally tasty. The pasta had a good boil, yielding a springy bit but it will be perfect if it was cooked Al dente. Every strand was coated in the mildly acidic tomato sauce, fair amount of concentrate yet not overly seasoned. Sometimes when I am really unlucky, I get some bad tasting pasta that either comes with a chunk of soggy noodles or a pool of unpalatable watery sauce. Here, no slipshod piece of work seen.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/t…What is a complete meal without a sweet ending? You've guess it! A chocolate-caramel war. Undoubtedly, the sweet course didn't come cheap, ranging from $6.50 - $7.50. But I am willing to foot the price if it tastes divine. I am split between a Strawberry Shortcake and the chocolate tart. In the end, the latter succeeded in talking me over. Fabulous piece of tart. The shortcrust crumbles neatly on my plate each time I forked right through. The highlight was that chilled chocolate fillings - soft and chewy. The cocoa flavour was explosive, so intense. Each mouthful was gooey when the chocolate fused with that sticky caramel substance in the middle. Flavour becomes good when it has a lot of layering and this Sea Salt Chocolate Caramel Tart depicts that - speechless.Coffee addict will not leave TM without a good Papa Palheta dose. The potion was rich, aromatic, not acrid - truly a stimulant. Not a fan on coffee? How about a cup of tea from Tea Forte? And if you are in the mood for some cocktails, they have the so-called popular drinks from Bar Stories presented in 5 groupings, that is, sweet, spicy, sour, bitter, and intriguingly to chill you.Though lesser known by diners, you could pick up anything from this retail-cum-cafe that fits a housewarmin"

Almost every dish was below expectations considering the prices. The only exception was the mushroom soup that came with the set.

There's some suggested combinations if you want to know what goes together, otherwise you can take a punt and hope they all go together. I got the salmon with a side of broccoli and mixed vegetables. I need greenery and this sounded like a healthy option. Sadly the vegetables came slathered in butter/oil and the salmon had a creamy dressing on top. It tasted fine but my tastebuds certainly weren't delighted. Next time I'll choose my combo more carefully.What I really loved about Table Manners was the fitout. I love the interior of this place - kind of like a Scandinavian library feel (not that I have any idea what the libraries look like in Scandinavia). There's free wifi and a chilled vibe, so it's also the perfect place to sit for a while if you need to have a meeting or do some work."

It's not trying to do too much, and with what they do do, they do it well.Our gang of six had a couple of different options, and all of us polished out plates - the truffle capellini had great flavour, and that yolk seemd to bind the flavours together, while my Louisiana fried chicken was not so much Southern, yet a very well battered and fried chop, so I didn't really have a lot to complain about. With very reasonable prices and a daily three-hour happy hour deal, you'll find a reason to come back."

If you want a little more intimacy, then you can opt to sit at the row of tables at a corner of the room. Outdoor seating is in a bird cage like gazebo just outside the restaurant.Onto the food. Enjoyable and hearty western cuisine. I was eyeing the Angus beef steak with truffle fries but it was sold out. Had the pork cutlet with aioli which was quite good. Very juicy and tasty. The baked salmon also won the boy's vote with its flavorful sauce. Drinks are from Bar stories, a sister company of Table Manners! There's happy hour from 5-8pm every day. Awesome!!

Started 2 sides (crusted oysters and baby squid calamari) while waiting for our 3 mains (platter combo, seafood spaghetti, seafood & chicken jambalaya). The pork ribs are tender and slides off the bones. Hubby loved the Cajun sauce. The other mains are only so-so. The guys are still not full and ordered the spicy wings and other portion of the baby squid calamari. The spicy wings are using the Cajun sauce again so hubby is thrilled again. (Although one of my guests think it's too spicy). The baby squid calamari is a favorite that we had to order a second portion. Apparently this dish is a sneak preview and will be introduced next year. Overall, the taste is decent. Although, I can't agree with the other reviews that the price is value for money."

It was one of his favorite dishes so I thought it was worth giving it a try. Bak Ku Teh (Pork rib soup) is one of the signature dishes of Singapore. You'll find that breakfast is somewhat of a liberal concept here- - it goes beyond just pancakes and eggs. If it's served in the morning, there's no reason it can't be breakfast. No one will look twice as you're devouring a hearty bowl of pork ribs for your morning nourishment.PORK RIB SOUPThe soup was peppery, garlicky and served piping hot. The pork ribs were fall off the bone-tender. A side of Youtiao (Chinese Donut) is great for dipping into the broth after you've finished the ribs. While the soup had a good kick it was unfortunately, just ok. SPICY PORK BELLYBraised pork belly served in a clay pot was tender however, a bit dry and too sweet. I found the chili infused soy sauce helped balanced out the sweetness but didn't do much for the dish overall. If I'm being honest, this is a pass for me. While this particular meal wasn't anywhere near my favorite, the soup would be best eaten when it's cold out."

PRAWN PANCAKE- Deep fried prawns with a thin crispy exterior was tasty. PORK CHOP FRIED RICE- The pork chops were well seasoned over the fragrant rice was superb.

Came across this place and menu looked good so we went in. The item which I hadn't experienced before was a little holder for my bag. It made for sitting at a little table better as I didn't have to balance my bag and I didn't have to hang it on the back of my chair. Clever. We ordered one of the steamed truffle and pork dumpling - a wee little thing which cost $5. I didn't want to order five in case we didn't enjoy it. My son chose the chicken dumplings. The food took a while to come and we were starving by then. The truffle dumpling was definitely worth it. I wish we had ordered more as it was better than the chicken dumplings. It features black truffles with fresh pork wrapped in the dumpling skin. And included rice broth in it so the liquid burst into your mouth when you bit into the dumpling. Delicious. We also had wontons and fried rice. Those were yummy too. Would go back next time we get a chance to visit Singapore.

Love the juicy succulent patty that is contrasted by the sharp special sauce. My favorite has got to be their breakfasts though. I would compare the portion to Jones', slightly smaller but this is half the price of what you pay there. Value for money or what? Lots used to do meats so the sausages are good. Looks a bit on the thin side but it's juicy and fragrant. The blueberry pancakes are fluffy and moist on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. I love the pancakes because they are not overly thick. I don't usually take pancakes because the taste gets boring after a while. Tried different pancakes from WH, Prive etc but i never liked them. FfT's is not bad but this is better. Go for blueberry, it's not as dry as the others.  The iced mocha is also one of the better ones i've had. I would put this after Jones' (or at the same spot).

Very fresh.Deep fried prawns in beancurd skin is nice and fresh.Hotplate otah is nice.Tong po rou could be softer.Sambal kang kong is nice.

We decided to check it out as none of us have been there although it seemed to be a popular seafood restaurant in Simpang Bedok. They are super packed and even provide valet services as parking is limited here.I am very intrique by the wall of crab shells graffti that their customers have left behind. Tucked away in the east, we tried some of their popular dishes like the salted egg crabs and the KL hokkein mee, pretty yummy and we were not disappointed. Definitely worth coming back and checking out their other dishes. I love how the management at this chain restaurants name their chain stores pretty catchy. This particular one is call big eater seafood, they have the other outlets by the name of Grand Eater  and Master Crab."

The crabs are firm and fresh, though the experts will tell you not to order when the moon is full or something like that. The salted egg yolk crab is better than the chili, while he KL hokkien mee is a happy heart attack on a plate; a mess of black stringy noodles and liberally sprinkled with lard. Oh so good.

This explains the long lines that snake past the store every lunchtime on the weekdays and throughout the day on the weekends - I would say that they are un-rivalled in the east. Although always busy, the owners take the time to get every order perfect, with give you the part of the chicken that you prefer if it is available. As it is a small store with only 2 or 3 people working in it, and with a high demand, prepare to wait for your chicken rice - I had to wait in line for about 20 minutes the last time I went, but it was worth it :)"

They have so many different stalls that offer at least 4-25 or so options each. It took me a long time to decide and I didn't even get the chance to check out everything.Saw the noodle soup and my eyes got fixated. I had the combination noodle soup, with a side of fried jumbo fish ball. The food looks better than it tastes. The noodle soup could use more salt, and the fish ball could use a better dipping sauce too. Overall, I was a little disappointed, but still enjoyed the food. The biggest win was the freshly juiced mango and guava cup that I had. It was so good I would have gotten another one (and try more food) if I wasn't already running late for my connection flight.Overall, don't let the overall rating scare you off.

When you reach the entrance of the food court, there are a couple of sign boards that tells you to purchase a card as the stalls doesn't accept cash payment. Doesn't make sense for foreigners and in fact it's inconvenient. Why? You have to queue up twice - to purchase the card and seek a refund for it (or you can keep it), but for those who don't like collecting cards, refunding it for cash is probably the option. Why not allow cash payment at the counters instead? The prices of the food are overpriced, but what do you expect at airports, it's usually like that everywhere. I had the chicken rice ($6.50) and it's average, not really to my liking. For those on stop-overs, it's good to have a taste of Singaporean food, I guess that's the purpose of this food court.

If you load too much money, they'll give refunds, but only in SGD.  The one thing I wanted, which was Hainan chicken rice, was CLOSED.  Sad face.  I settled for the roast duck and roast pork plate and shared the combination dry noodle with with my friend.  The food looks so amazing in the photos, but were pathetic when they served the dish on the counter.  The portions were only 50% of what was pictured and the quality left more to be desired. If you're laying over in the airport and are super desperate to get a taste of Singapore food, I guessssss you could eat here.  Otherwise, stay away."

I had the pulled duck macaroni which was made with 3 different types of cheese. Satisfying but a bit filling for one given the generous amounts of cheese heaped on the macaroni. My partner had the salted egg yolk pasta, which was cutely served in a jar. Didn't try it but she enjoyed it. Both our meals were served with a small side salad that was drizzled with wasabi teriyaki sauce. Couldn't appreciate the peculiar flavour but to each his own! :)Topped up $2 for earl grey tea and $5 for a jar cake"

YOU WILL SEE ANOTHER COFFEE BEAN!! and right next to it, fart tartz cafe!! :) It is a cute cafe, with sofa seats, high bar counter top seats too.. and the bloom tarts :D They're soo cute, although they looked bigger on photos, they're actually palm sized. We ordered a matcha and a oreo nutella one, based on the shops' recommendation. at $5.50 nett, I can't complain too much. It was fun to cam whore with the ""potted plants"" and you get to keep the fake flower.. hurray for my mother! and we dug in!! :) the matcha was light and you could still taste the green tea flavour. The oreo nutella was a winner, I mean.. who doesn't like nutella? it's a winner on it's own.. at the bottom of the flower pot, there is a an actual chunk of the oreo, with the cream filling.. :) all in all a nice treat.. although I wouldn't bother taking 1hr 40 mins worth of train rides just for this.. but if you are in the area, do give it a try!"

I would definitely buy the whole cake if I could! *Durian Ice CreamThis is the real deal! A big sign was put up there stating that it's a ""die die must try"" item. Ugh I mean, how can I just leave without trying it? It comes in two sizes: medium sized pint or small pint. I went with the latter. Wow, my mind was blown away! It was so velvety and rich! You could really taste the durian dancing on your taste bud! A must try indeed! I kept thinking to myself that I should've gotten the bigger pint. Oh well, next time! They also have different durian-inspired offerings such as durian hot pot (yes, for real), durian pancake, durian spring rolls, and many more! If you're looking for gifts to bring home, they sell different durian products (chips, dried durian, kaya jam, candies, cookies, etc.)I would definitely recommend this place to durian lovers out there!

Her cravings for noodles...is as demonic as my cravings for Pampangan Sisig. So I was game. I caved in and followed her even though the last 20+ times I've had any bak chor mee out and about had been a sheer disappointment that made me ask...""where the bloody hell did all the good *shi-fu-level-peeps* go?""She insisted on ordering for me and made me sit like a little bish at the only table available in another overcrowded part of Singapore [surprise...surprise]. She is an older sister to me so I have to listen...I have to obey. But guess what? I skipped being part of a 30+ minute line. These motherfarters are slow at 1930 hrs. Really slow. She was probably 10th in line...but 30 minutes before she got to order and FOR NOODLES??? You've got to be bloody joking!

I did see right after all!Yet, let's put it this way.That farter is alive and still cooking in hungry Singapore because what he brought out...was indeed worth the $4'ish dollars we paid per bowl. He's alive because the liver and minced pork brought loving flavors and a soup so hearty [from hundreds of plunged-to-cook-pork] that it made my heart slow down. He's alive because the freaking noodles seduced my tongue with each nibble and returned my need for bak chor mee in Singapore. He's alive...well...because people forget his snail-act the moment they plow into his food.So they are obviously not close to perfect [and probably brought some shame into the original which I now have to try]...but I'm still a fan because I'd eat this 30-minute-line-bowl-of-bak-chor-mee any freaking given day of my life here in Singapore.

If you are not sure, look for the Apple store or the Muji store, and you will find Shake Shack about 50m away. There used to be horrendous 1-2 hr queues when it first opened. But now, you should be able to get to place your order within 5 to 30 minutes of joining the queue of hungry patrons.SERVICEWith the covid-19 social distancing measures, the only service you experience is when you're queuing to get in and also when you are making your order at the cashier. Other than that, there is no other interaction with the staff. Good and bad perhaps. There is a self service automated hand washing machine around the middle of the restaurant, so that's as close as you get to somone washing your hands for you.FOOD & DRINKSThe special item in Singapore is the Pandan Shake. Just reading the item on the menu gave me a toothache. I might give it a try one day when I need a sugar rush...one day. The Hamburger feels a bit over priced at $7.50 for a basic item. The meat free Shroom Burger ($10.80) is quite good too with a light crispy mushroom patty.Personal favourite items are the crinkle cut fries and Shack Burger ($9.20 single & $14.40 for the double).

While the beef patty itself is average, what really makes this burger standout is the overall quality ingredients including the burger bun, secret sauce, cheese, and bacon. Highly recommend the Smoke Shack which includes the cheese, bacon, and red peppers. Regarding the wait time. If you go during their peak times (weekends all day & weekdays lunch rush) you could wait up to an 1 hour. For  off peak times less than 15 mins."

So I got the smoke shack, milk shakes - peanut butter and the festive shakes, cheesy fries and concretes Shack Attack. The Smoke Shack was with bacon. I was disappointed with the bacon as it was tough not the crispy type. My fellow diners whom had the same felt the same disappointment. You imagine trying to eat some bark, that's what the applewood bacon was like - they must have removed the Apple and left the wood there. Minus 1  . The burger was not put together properly as in you do not get the cherry peppers evenly spread. So in one of my bite I took all the peppers, that was very spicy. Minus 1  for badly put together burger. The holiday cookie shake was like a sugar frozen yogurt. It was totally overly horribly sweet yogurt until the cookie crumbs that was only at the bottom 3 mm of the shake and you get the few cookie crumbs. It would be much better if there were more cookies crumbs. Minus 1 I easily found a table upstairs but as usual the normal locals here don't clean up their mess. There was like 4 staff standing waiting to wipe the tables but do not help clearing the table. They did not even help open the trash box flap when I took all the trash there. Standing like a block of wood.  Sure it is Boxing Day but you choose to come back to work, so get working. However they did wiped off the table. Minus 1 Ok something good must be said here, otherwise I run out of  and I have not even talk about the weird tables/chairs layout. The peanut butter shake was good, not the best or like those in US but for local establishment it is good. Overall the food seems over rated. Or may the hype just too much that I expected perfect food. It is just a so so establishment. I probably go there for the shake again and not the burger."

None of that for Shake Shack. For once, this burger place, on a morning 10.30am crowd, feels a bit like a club, a gathering place, a temple, like an Apple store in the past, of sorts.Yes, this might be a club for burgers and milkshake, much like the Apple store just a few feet away is to a haven for technology.If you wanna have brunch, come in before 10.30am and the queue won't be so bad. We waited for only about 20 mins (queueing and waiting for food altogether) and we were very lucky to have a seat very quickly. We finished our brunch at around 11am.The burger is really like totally opposite of what I used to love - Carl's Junior. None of that messy, cheesy, huge big fat patty. Its packaging may not seem big but it's filling for me (I ordered the single patty). I saw many people actually ordering the double patty. The bun was really high quality, the vegetables fit in just well, not too much and not too little. The patty supposedly tastes higher quality as well. Overall its a premium package burger. Some people might not be impressed as there is no 'kick' or 'wow' factor right off the bat. But when you bite into that clean non-messy-at-all burger and you remembered those days when your jeans had all that spilt sauce from your burger, you might appreciate this experience better. For me, I'd choose this any day. Yes some may say this is expensive. But I like that there is no silly convulated pricing and you do get the quality through in the burger and the milkeshakes, where I suppose shackburger and shakes is where its name derives from.Being impressed I'd give this a 4.5/5.+5 is from their quality, cleanliness, atmosphere, smiley service crew, good shackburger, milkshakes and drinks. You leave feeling good.-0.5 is from overtly-salty fries, not much option on condiments (only ketchup and mustard) and also price could be a bit prohibitive for some."

Had a line so must mean it's good right? Who knows as at an airport people sometimes choose convenience. Turned out pretty tasty. He had the chicken rendang set and I had the mee rebus set. The set came with a choice of drink and we selected barley instead of tea or coffee. He said his chicken rendang tasted good and it did look good. Not a huge portion but enough. My mee rebus wasn't to my taste and was different than the preparation I had growing up. Could be that it's a regional difference between Singapore and Malaysia.

The bun was pillowy and as someone who eats pulled pork from the American south, I would happily put this in front of any of my southern friends with the perfect assurance they will love it. For me I had the crawfish Kuay Tiao (wise rice noodle) with a side of achar.  The  dish was a perfect amalgamation of street style char kuay tiao with a luxurious flair with the crawfish addition. Finally dessert. Oh heaven wept. Pandas cake so soft hubs was afraid it may collapse. My Ondeh with durian was so soft and sublime. Warm pandan crepe filled with durian, top with cool ice cream. Heaven really wept!!!! Service was top notch too.So run don't walk to this gem!!!!"

Stepping inside, you'd doubtlessly feel transported into the 60s. Nay, 50s. Food:Overall, quite a number of stand outs. (1) bakwang kepiting soup. Now, I found the broth a little strange. Too much fried shallots. However, the crab meat and minced meat paste was fabulous, sitting on a crab shell. I enjoyed it greatly. My sis didn't. Ah well. Can't please everyone! $5 each person, minimum two people. (2) Ayam buah keluak. I genuinely loved the buah keluak!!!! I dug it out with my spoon and usually it's just the nutty earthy meat. But at this place, I believed they stuffed the nut with other spices and mixed the buah keluak meat with minced meat! In any cAse, it was sedap!!!! (3) sambal udang (prawns). Yummmmmmmm. (4) chili fries pomfret. Crispy and fresh. Reminds me of home. All in all, a good meal. My dad wanted chendol but they don't have it!!

The noodle bowls come in three sizes- small, medium, jumbo. You can choose to have your noodles in a soup, or dry (with soup on the side). And from your noodles, you can choose thin rice noodles or chewy egg noodles, or a combination of both! I tried both noodles, and both were cooked to a perfect texture. The broth here has a heavy prawn flavor, and you can tell it's been cooked with rich seafood. Other prawn mee places have broths that barely have prawn flavors to it, and taste mostly like pork. I don't usually drink broth for a noodle soup, but I downed this one like there was no tomorrow. Never in my life have I eaten a bowl of noodles and soup so quickly before.

So good!!! Drove pass and saw such a big crowd and decided to join in. 1. Prawn mee with pork ribs- the broth was great! although they didn't give a lot of noodles. - pork was good. prawns as expected. - pricing per bowl was $5.50-10 (for the jumbo). I think it's quite pricey considering it's a coffee shop open air type place (in Singapore). 2. Ngoh hiong- they shared the coffee shop space (2 units) with a Ngoh Hiong shop. I think it's probably owned by the same people. - Ngoh hiong was good! We ordered the i) you tiao with fishcake, ii) money bags (kinda like a fried wanton), iii) some fried beancurb skin with fishcake (this was so thin & crispy), iv)spring rolls. Everything was great! except the spring rolls (don't bother ordering that). - The red sauce that accompanied the Ngoh Hiong was awesome! sweet yet a little spicy at the same time.Definitely will head back for more prawn mee & ngoh hiong :)Only draw back was the parking - super hard to get a spot! and the parking attendent comes pretty frequently to fine people who were illegally parking on the double yellow lines (be warned)."

Every time I pass this place, it's either bursting at the seams or closed. I've been coming here since I was a kid and the price of the prawn mee, like my girth, has increased exponentially. Which is a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Why would anyone pay upwards of $5 for a bowl of prawn mee, and still have to put in the labour of peeling the shell? Er. That would be me, actually. The soup is thick and flavourful, the pork rib, tender, and the chili powder. Oh, the chili powder. The soup would be incomplete without a couple of heavy handed dashes of spice. Noodles are fairly standard, but it's the soup that delivers a warming kick in the pants. Parking, like most of the Katong/Joo Chiat stretch is treacherous. We've only ever illegal parked there before, and even so, that gives you two lots to play with. Good luck fighting with the hungry hoards over the limited space."

I had the soup version when I was younger but have grown to love the ""dry"" version. You can order your noodles in soup or with soup on the side - the latter makes for a better choice because you will be able to enjoy the rich broth in its original form, especially fantastic when spiced up with a bit of chilli from the noodles. If you are having the noodles dry, mix in some chilli powder and you'll get a kick out of eating this bowl of noodles. There are people who pick the pork ribs and prawn option. You can also request to have your prawns deshelled. But I think the original works super well for me."

Meals seem to consist of about 5 chicken wings per serving, and you have a quite a few styles of seasoning to choose from. We went with the Cajun, the Louisiana rub and one other that I can't remember (something to do with honey?) and aside from the Louisiana being incredibly sour, they were pretty tasty. That said, sour wasn't too bad either. Something different about their wings is that you can order a batch of the boneless variety. Eating boneless chicken wings might be akin to eating nuggets or blasphemy for some people, but we also had to feed a hyperactive baby so boneless works out quite well for us! The burger and fries were also all kinds of yum, and the coleslaw was much better than the Colonel's. The big drawback is that for its price range, it just wasn't very filling. The meal came up to about $10 per person, which puts it between a McDonald's and Carl's Jr... Or about on par with a Wendy's. But those places tend to leave you feeling satisfied and we felt like we could fit in another few chicken wings each. Still, it's worth trying at least once."

I'm a huge Wing Stop fan in the states and I was elated when I was on my way to Mustaffa Centre and came across this place! I quickly ordered some Cajun and Original flavored wings, fries with extra seasoning, and a coke. The wings were different from the states but the flavor was still there. The fries were not up to par and the seasoning was just okay. The service was pretty decent so I guess that deserves an added star...

The service was pretty good, what I thought was a disinterested half asleep employee was actually someone working on paperwork who quickly greeted me and patiently took my order. I say ""patiently"" because there menu and display is a bit confusing. They have a digital menu display that only show promoted combos, suave choices and some add ons, they have free standing promo signs, showing the same thing as the digital menu board. What I couldn't figure out how to order was just wings, it appeared that you could only order combos. Once approaching the counter I figured out from another, countertop menu that you can order ala-carte wings. We lazily ended up ordering the boneless wings, which is actually a good value, no extra charge, a lot more meat. We got three sauces, Honey Smoked BBQ, Original Hot, and Louisiana Rub. The BBQ, was too sticky sweet and not enough smoke flavor, and too much sauce. The original hot was a pretty good buffalo flavor, not too saucy, but well covered. The Louisiana Rub was the best of our three, dry rub, tasty seasoning, nice. The French fries were okay, nothing special not bad. The price seemed a bit high, probably not for a sit down wing restaurant but this is fast food style so there's a disconnect in feeling. The food was prepared to order though. I have another favorite wing place ""Wings World"" but I wouldn't avoid this place and will probably come back."

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although the Char Kway Teow was good here, I don't think the massive line represents how good it was in regards to others we went to and isn't always a measure of quality.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.Although the flavours balanced very well, the Wok Hei wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and this lacked that substance and pow that you get when the Wok Hei is infused to perfection. Given Hill Streets Kway Teow's reputation and a glimpse of how good it could be from my taste, I'll be back again to confirm whether it was an ""off"" day or not but with a 20 minute line, if it's not stellar next time, I won't be back.Cheers!Dave."

After years of mostly trying to avoid this dish for health issues, i very occasionally dig in to this once or twice year only.The queue here is always long and I bought the biggest baddest plate they got which was the $4 portion with an added $1 for seahum totalling to $5. Still tasty, has the wokhei taste people look for in this dish, but not so wet with eggy goodness as it was before. The seahum that day was lacklustre to say the least. Small and shrivelled.Although the queues here still snake till the moment they off their lights... I feel it has turned average.

My research led me to Ya Kun and conveniently this location was close to where we were staying. It was still early so it wasn't super busy when we arrived. We both ordered kaya toast with 2 boiled eggs and iced coffee. My husband ordered peanut butter kaya toast while I stuck toEverything is made it order and our food came out quickly. We tried each other's kaya toast and both preferred the original. It was sweet and tasty. Dipping the toast in the soft boiled eggs is highly recommended. Coffee was good too. I recommend trying kaya toast from this place.

The combo was very filling.  I saw people cracking open the soft boil egg and soak it with bread. But I opt to eat it separately.  Needed a bit of seasoning. They also sell kaya jam here which makes a great souvenir.

And the lady in charges of toasting the breads brought it to be when she's done and she does to all her customers! With a smile and eye contact. Similarly when the cashier thanked me, she made eye contact too. And I noticed that the tables were cleaned up very speedily. So the place is keep clean and neat throughout my stay. And i especially have to mention that the cashier is just as friendly to the supplier who came in to ask if she needs anything. She made eye contact, smiled and thanked him for dropping by.

So on our first morning, we walked over to this location which was close by.While there weren't a ton of people inside, there was a consistent stream of people coming in and out. Most of them seemed to already know what they wanted to order, so I assume they must be regulars.The menu has a variety of toast options, and most people order the set ($4.80), which comes with a toast of your choice, 2 soft boiled eggs (or hard boiled if you ask), and a drink (tea/coffee).We tried both the Steamed Kaya Toast and the Cheese Toast. I loved how warm and fluffy the steamed toast was, which sat comfortably in my stomach. In contrast, the cheese toast was bland, and I really couldn't tell that there was cheese in it. Also the bread was flat, hard and a little on the burnt side.What I also didn't really love, was the 2 eggs. I'm a little iffy about runny eggs, so we asked for them to be cooked fully, which was not a problem, only took a little more time. Even after waiting though, the eggs were still on the undercooked side.In general though, I really enjoyed my first kaya toast in Singapore. This place really provides a quick and cheap way to taste a Singaporean breakfast! Unfortunately I'm not the kind of person to enjoy the eggs, but I can see how other people love it."

I believe it was but it lacked depth and the different sorts of beef (i really missed the pork knuckle and the black pudding) which make me love this Vietnamese noodle soup so much. But hey, it was only 6 S$, so I'll be forgiving and forget the fact that it was a tad salty and greasy for my liking and highlight that it came with a sizable portion of beef, something which is not common in foodcourts.Would I eat this again? Not really, only if I happen to pass by this foodcourt again as it did not look like other options were much better but I would certainly not go out of my way for this.Arguably, I've never been to Vietnam so maybe I am not entitled for having an opinion on how Vietnamese food should taste but I have spend considerable parts of my life eating Pho both at my Vietnamese friends homes and in Vietnamese restaurants in Paris, SoCal and Philly, all of which have sizeable Vietnamese communities so sue me for having an opinion...

This was recommended by the proprietor and I'm glad we took it.- fried rice with salted fish. This tied the meal together. Rice had good wok-fired flavor and the pieces of salted fish gave a nice texture and salty bite. They're like little pieces of fish bacon.Add a large bottle of Tiger, and you've got a fantastic meal.

The restaurant it self is located on Albert St. not Prinsep St. as in Yelp's map. First impression this is quite a big restaurant but very busy even off time.  It is not clean nor dirty, just average of Chinese restaurant. The decoration is also similar to other Chinese's style street restaurant. The owner speak little English but still able to understand and give good food recommendation. Very lovely old lady. The food..looks plane but the taste...magnificent!! I don't know how to describe, its the best Chinese food I had in years. The portion is also quite generous. We ordered every dish medium size but they looks like large size to us. We ate until we are stuff, can't believe we were able to finish all the food. Even more surprising, it taste so good since the first bite till the last. And then came the bill....lest than S$80 for 4big dishes and 2 big bottle or beer thats S$20 for person! Awesome!!"

The main entrance is directly opposite Fortune Center (the yellow and white building along Middle Road) and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al-fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community. If you're coming from the side door, it is just next to Torte café (the brownie is to die for) at the end of Waterloo Street. I've dined at Artichoke a couple of times (both on weekend brunch and dinner) and always had the best time here. For brunch, you need to come for their Mezza platter (perfect for 2) which consist of 4 mezze (usually babaganoush, hummus, beetroot and smoked salmon) and a few slices of toasted bread. I suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive. One portion is never enough all the time! For dinner last night, we had the usual mezze plates of hummus, babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken, burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share. All the mains were delicious and I wished we ordered second or third of the burrata (I can eat burrata everyday). The deep fried cauliflower was amazing too, the best I've tried in Singapore after Pony Dining in Eagle Strret Pier, Brisbane. Flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture. HEAVEN. The grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender. What makes it so special is the garlic puree (no kissing after eating this, so you have been forewarned) that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it. Do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you're into trying something new. I've heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here. Well, I think it all depends on what you order and how you order. They have their best seller - The ""Lambgasm"" - a 2.8kg bone-in-lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at $220. So of course, if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails, the bill will definitely come up to $300 - $400.  The four of us ordered 4 mezze plates, 3 mains with no drinks and we paid a total of $124 ($28 each) last night. Considering the food we ate, the price was relatively cheap and reasonable. And we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice (not extremely full or bloated) and very satisfied with dinner. It can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner, so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment."

Food was great, a nice change from the typical cafe fare; my only gripe was the cold service. We tried:- Cauliflower Sabbich ($22): I personally enjoyed this, though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted/grilled, and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture. This had a slightly soggy feel to it. The Israeli salad provided some tang, which I liked, and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk - would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though. Overall a tasty dish.- Haloumi & Mushrooms ($22): The best dish of the 3, in my opinion. The toast was thick and fluffy, with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms. The best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast - it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado, haloumi and mushroom all in one bite. - Artichoke Fried Chicken ($24): 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns, which went nicely with the garlic whip. Slightly too greasy for me, and the chicken had a hint of honey. Didn't enjoy the coleslaw, but the chicken was flavorful. We didn't finish this.Good quality and novel food, would return to try their intriguing dinner menu!"

In layman's terms, a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting.The food itself is just tremendous. My wife and I started off with the Pita and hummus. It was spot on. Next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder. Wow, simply wow. The meat just fell off the bone after the first cut, which is a testament to how tender it was. Mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs, this dish easily was the star of the meal.  The other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish. It was very good, but surprisingly sweet. I probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash. Nevertheless, these dishes on their own are just fantastic.We topped the dinner off with Artichoke's Neh Neh Pops. I went for the Mango Sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango. After the first bite, it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller.  Common, how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango. Great food, Great Vibe, Great Company.

We were able to make a reservation right before leaving the house. We walked and found this restaurant tucked away with cobblestone-like area leading up to it's entrance. You're immediately greeted by the dessert case and then are seated in either patio or inside space. The ambiance is overall chic/hip. The lighting in the evening is soft and romantic. The food is phenomenal and the service is very good as well. This is one of my favorite tapas joints in Singapore. We started with the red sangria pitcher and then ordered the roasted cauliflower, which had pomegranate. It was so tasty and different! We also got the whole market fish ($34), roasted pumpkin, and humus. They brought out pita, but we were good Paleo kids and didn't touch it. We saved our cheat for the dark chocolate and almond baklava. Delicious. We'll definitely be back."

Great vibe and great music. Most importantly great food. Everything we had was delicious so I will simply list everything we had and all dishes are best to be shared.For mezze we had babaganoush paired with the pita bread, rich but yummy. Had some cured swordfish and fresh figs with goat cheese which were both really refreshing. Would suggest ordering mezze to start! They are small dishes for 2-4 people.For sides we had the feta burrata, broccoli salad, and the green beans and beet. Could pass on these but it is nice to have veggies since all the other dishes are so rich.For mains we had the duck tacos which was messy to eat but yummy and filling. The hot skillet prawns are a must! The lamb shoulder dish was rich and yummy but filling and definitely for sharing.We got hot tea which actually worked so well with our meal because it helped cut the rich flavors between dishes.I definitely recommend this place and would go again and maybe try their weekend brunch.

But not only do I give this jewel a 5 star, but also would go as far as saying, if I were to recommend just one restaurant to have a unique tantalizing food experience in Singapore -- other than the local options like chicken rice & chili crab that everyone must check off their list --  it would've be Artichoke. (But with that being said, I have heard the same thing being said about Burnt Ends -- which I will definitely try soon enough.) Artichoke offers creative dishes, while staying true to the root of its cuisine. (Yes, regardless of how delicious their food is, some restaurants just puzzle me with what cuisine they are serving to me.)  How delicately they pull this off-- amazing. Here goes the breakdown: Hummus (4.5/5) -- No frill. GOOD hummus-- not the watered-down version that makes you question how much of chickpeas is in it. A bit of a bummer that it doesn't come with any pita bread. I know I can just eat spoonful(s) of hummus by itself, but come one, not even one? Pita Bread (4.5/5) -- Served hot. Pita bread served here is on the thicker side. Not too chewy, but I can tell it's good quality & actually understand why this is a separate item to be ordered rather than served on the side, although I complained above on not coming with my hummus order. This is a must order as many of the dishes at Artichoke has sauces that deserves to be wiped to the bottom with this pita bread.  Fresh Fig & Goat cheese (5/5) -- I admit that even from just reading this menu, I knew that I was to fall in love. Fig & goat cheese simply cannot go wrong. But then again, how Artichoke artfully put together fresh fig on a spread of creamy goat cheese was just orgasmic. Feta Burrata (5/5) -- Really fresh & unique twist to the regular burrata dishes. I'd say this is the prime example of what I meant by 'creative while staying true to the root'. Some may argue that burrata is Italian, but adding the feta kick to it absolutely justified its presence on the Mediterranean menu. Innovative & just plain delicious. Hot Skillet Prawn (5/5) -- Jesus. My friend and I almost licked the skillet. 4 HUGE prawns that was better than lobster. Sauce was not to be wasted. I remember this dish being rather salty last time but this time, they were perfect. Have this. Just have it. Slow-roasted Lamb Shoulder (5/5) -- SO SUCCULENT & FULL OF FLAVOR! Another dish that requires pita bread to wash the plate. Lamb was so well-roasted -- the texture of the meat was soft while not mushy. The smell of the lamb was very well controlled (I know for some people the strong smell particular to lamb meat is of problem). Babaganoush (3.5/5) -- Don't get me wrong. Just because I raved about other dishes so much doesn't mean that babaganoush was bad. It was just different from my expectation of creamy dark colored paste. Artichoke's babaganoush made it very obvious that it was made of eggplant (the texture and taste is maintained, unlike other babaganoush I've tried). It was good, but I prefer my creamy dark colored version. Neh Neh pops -- It shows that you don't have to go crazy complicated to come up with a strongly branded item. Neh Neh pop's simple yet alluring presentation along with its hand-packed-looking packaging crafts a sense of craft (no pun intended) -- which draws people, making them ignore the little voice in their head saying 'it's just magnum with bunch of stuffs put all over'. They seem to be actively experimenting with the flavors -- such as Neh-espresso, Cheesecake, etc. Looking forward to all the fun flavors. - Baklava flavor (3/5): I am a huge fan of balkava -- how its crispness is preserved while keeping all the mouth-watering sweetness in between its layers. But really not impressed by this flavor on NehNeh pops. Ice cream wasn't rich either (actually tasted a bit of icy-ness, which is what I taste when ice cream melts & then re-freezes.) I wouldn't go for it. A bit too sweet as baklava's sugary sweetness and ice cream & chocolate's deeper sweetness strikes your tastebuds separately creating a not-so-pleasant overdose of sweetness. - Strawberry pokey (4/5): Contrary to my initial standing that it'd be rather boring, its back-to-basic approach was done very well. I don't think the cover was white chocolate -- which really works for me. I look for a lot of things when visiting a restaurant, but here food speaks for the brand. The ambiance & entirety of experience isn't bad, but not impression-leaving. Food is just so well-done. It is not only delicious, un-pretentious, but also fun. This is combination of using good ingredients, adding succulent flavors, playing with mix of tastes, while not losing touch in presentation."

The entrance to this restaurant is a short alley amongst empty houses. It almost became a quaint place hidden in the middle of busy streets. We were seated outdoor in a lovely garden. Menu was quite interesting - it's probably because I'm not experienced with Middle Eastern food. We had 2 dishes to share and my apology for not having the exact name but they are: 1. a BIG pile of burrata on top of buttery bread - I'm biased from having Osteria Mozza the night before so this can not match up, but I would say it's not too bad 2. salmon pancake - which I thought was quite delicious, a good combination of sweetness from the pancakes and saltiness from the smoked salmon. Artichoke seemed to be very generous with its portion and the two of us were so stuffed after those 2 dishes :)We had a look at the Overdough bakery and everything looked so delicious. I will definitely come back to try some baked goods!"

The décor of this place is quite rustic, and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in New York City where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else.   As for our first experience, we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated (around 2pm). Although I was dying for some fried chicken, the second best thing available on the menu - mushroom scrabbled egg - was just equally delicious. They do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table.Personally I enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch. The menu is bigger - about 10 mezzes and 10 entrees, plus some side dishes. The must haves - pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze, burrata and prawns from the entrée.

We often feel we need our Artichoke fix so we go about once a month. Bjorn does amazing things with food and he doesn't apologize for anything. He constantly tries new flavor combinations and clearly works them out until they are delicious. His cauliflower is something I dream about at night. The fried chicken is out of this world and the prawns are unexplainable you just have to try them for yourself. The ambience is also our favorite because we always feel welcome, comfortable, and relaxed. It's like you are dining in your favorite Uncles house and you don't need to impress anyone.

This is one of those places that makes me think its reviews are all fake. All of the raves of this place must be fake or by people who have no idea what food should taste like. The food here is not ""all that"". Its really not. The reality is that this place has bland food that ""looks and sounds good"". First we ordered the hummus. They say they make it on site. I call BS on that. If they are making it they are doing it wrong. It tastes and looks store bought. Well, not even that good. All they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil. Thats it, its bland, tasteless, and just boring. Next, we had the fried cauliflower, again boring and nothing special. It looks great but has no flavor. After that the fried chicken and beef ribs. They both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through. With the chicken, all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it, the breading, and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce. The ribs were just sweet and tender. None of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat. Finally we had the famous ""sticky date pudding"", this was just taking the piss. Its just watered down peanut butter, with grass jelly, topped with ground up Chinese peanut cakes and sugar. No dates, nothing sticky, and NO flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes. A great example of ""up selling"". They use really cheap ingredients, make it look fancy, and sell it for a ton of money. This last dish made me feel like I was a rube getting fleeced. I bet their food costs are 5%. I wish the food in Singapore was as good as the food in Seoul or Tokyo but its just not. Restaurants like these confirm my opinion. The only good food in Singapore is at Hawker centers. If you go to places like this, its just for atmosphere and not for good food. Its a total waste of money."

The cauliflower was deliciously salted and breaded, and the dressing was tasty.Cuttlefish shawarma, chicken fat dressing, lime ($25) - 3.75 starsThe texture of the cuttlefish was excellent - not too rubbery and grilled just right.

The main entrance is directly opposite Fortune Center (the yellow and white building along Middle Road) and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al-fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community. If you're coming from the side door, it is just next to Torte café (the brownie is to die for) at the end of Waterloo Street. I've dined at Artichoke a couple of times (both on weekend brunch and dinner) and always had the best time here. For brunch, you need to come for their Mezza platter (perfect for 2) which consist of 4 mezze (usually babaganoush, hummus, beetroot and smoked salmon) and a few slices of toasted bread. I suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive. One portion is never enough all the time! For dinner last night, we had the usual mezze plates of hummus, babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken, burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share. All the mains were delicious and I wished we ordered second or third of the burrata (I can eat burrata everyday). The deep fried cauliflower was amazing too, the best I've tried in Singapore after Pony Dining in Eagle Strret Pier, Brisbane. Flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture. HEAVEN. The grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender. What makes it so special is the garlic puree (no kissing after eating this, so you have been forewarned) that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it. Do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you're into trying something new. I've heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here. Well, I think it all depends on what you order and how you order. They have their best seller - The ""Lambgasm"" - a 2.8kg bone-in-lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at $220. So of course, if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails, the bill will definitely come up to $300 - $400.  The four of us ordered 4 mezze plates, 3 mains with no drinks and we paid a total of $124 ($28 each) last night. Considering the food we ate, the price was relatively cheap and reasonable. And we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice (not extremely full or bloated) and very satisfied with dinner. It can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner, so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment."

Food was great, a nice change from the typical cafe fare; my only gripe was the cold service. We tried:- Cauliflower Sabbich ($22): I personally enjoyed this, though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted/grilled, and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture. This had a slightly soggy feel to it. The Israeli salad provided some tang, which I liked, and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk - would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though. Overall a tasty dish.- Haloumi & Mushrooms ($22): The best dish of the 3, in my opinion. The toast was thick and fluffy, with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms. The best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast - it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado, haloumi and mushroom all in one bite. - Artichoke Fried Chicken ($24): 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns, which went nicely with the garlic whip. Slightly too greasy for me, and the chicken had a hint of honey. Didn't enjoy the coleslaw, but the chicken was flavorful. We didn't finish this.Good quality and novel food, would return to try their intriguing dinner menu!"

In layman's terms, a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting.The food itself is just tremendous. My wife and I started off with the Pita and hummus. It was spot on. Next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder. Wow, simply wow. The meat just fell off the bone after the first cut, which is a testament to how tender it was. Mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs, this dish easily was the star of the meal.  The other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish. It was very good, but surprisingly sweet. I probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash. Nevertheless, these dishes on their own are just fantastic.We topped the dinner off with Artichoke's Neh Neh Pops. I went for the Mango Sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango. After the first bite, it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller.  Common, how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango. Great food, Great Vibe, Great Company. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes, but of course order that lamb shoulder again."

But not only do I give this jewel a 5 star, but also would go as far as saying, if I were to recommend just one restaurant to have a unique tantalizing food experience in Singapore -- other than the local options like chicken rice & chili crab that everyone must check off their list --  it would've be Artichoke. (But with that being said, I have heard the same thing being said about Burnt Ends -- which I will definitely try soon enough.) Artichoke offers creative dishes, while staying true to the root of its cuisine. (Yes, regardless of how delicious their food is, some restaurants just puzzle me with what cuisine they are serving to me.)  How delicately they pull this off-- amazing. Here goes the breakdown: Hummus (4.5/5) -- No frill. GOOD hummus-- not the watered-down version that makes you question how much of chickpeas is in it. A bit of a bummer that it doesn't come with any pita bread. I know I can just eat spoonful(s) of hummus by itself, but come one, not even one? Pita Bread (4.5/5) -- Served hot. Pita bread served here is on the thicker side. Not too chewy, but I can tell it's good quality & actually understand why this is a separate item to be ordered rather than served on the side, although I complained above on not coming with my hummus order. This is a must order as many of the dishes at Artichoke has sauces that deserves to be wiped to the bottom with this pita bread.  Fresh Fig & Goat cheese (5/5) -- I admit that even from just reading this menu, I knew that I was to fall in love. Fig & goat cheese simply cannot go wrong. But then again, how Artichoke artfully put together fresh fig on a spread of creamy goat cheese was just orgasmic. Feta Burrata (5/5) -- Really fresh & unique twist to the regular burrata dishes. I'd say this is the prime example of what I meant by 'creative while staying true to the root'. Some may argue that burrata is Italian, but adding the feta kick to it absolutely justified its presence on the Mediterranean menu. Innovative & just plain delicious. Hot Skillet Prawn (5/5) -- Jesus. My friend and I almost licked the skillet. 4 HUGE prawns that was better than lobster. Sauce was not to be wasted. I remember this dish being rather salty last time but this time, they were perfect. Have this. Just have it. Slow-roasted Lamb Shoulder (5/5) -- SO SUCCULENT & FULL OF FLAVOR! Another dish that requires pita bread to wash the plate. Lamb was so well-roasted -- the texture of the meat was soft while not mushy. The smell of the lamb was very well controlled (I know for some people the strong smell particular to lamb meat is of problem). Babaganoush (3.5/5) -- Don't get me wrong. Just because I raved about other dishes so much doesn't mean that babaganoush was bad. It was just different from my expectation of creamy dark colored paste. Artichoke's babaganoush made it very obvious that it was made of eggplant (the texture and taste is maintained, unlike other babaganoush I've tried). It was good, but I prefer my creamy dark colored version. Neh Neh pops -- It shows that you don't have to go crazy complicated to come up with a strongly branded item. Neh Neh pop's simple yet alluring presentation along with its hand-packed-looking packaging crafts a sense of craft (no pun intended) -- which draws people, making them ignore the little voice in their head saying 'it's just magnum with bunch of stuffs put all over'. They seem to be actively experimenting with the flavors -- such as Neh-espresso, Cheesecake, etc. Looking forward to all the fun flavors. - Baklava flavor (3/5): I am a huge fan of balkava -- how its crispness is preserved while keeping all the mouth-watering sweetness in between its layers. But really not impressed by this flavor on NehNeh pops. Ice cream wasn't rich either (actually tasted a bit of icy-ness, which is what I taste when ice cream melts & then re-freezes.) I wouldn't go for it. A bit too sweet as baklava's sugary sweetness and ice cream & chocolate's deeper sweetness strikes your tastebuds separately creating a not-so-pleasant overdose of sweetness. - Strawberry pokey (4/5): Contrary to my initial standing that it'd be rather boring, its back-to-basic approach was done very well. I don't think the cover was white chocolate -- which really works for me. I look for a lot of things when visiting a restaurant, but here food speaks for the brand. The ambiance & entirety of experience isn't bad, but not impression-leaving. Food is just so well-done. It is not only delicious, un-pretentious, but also fun. This is combination of using good ingredients, adding succulent flavors, playing with mix of tastes, while not losing touch in presentation."

The entrance to this restaurant is a short alley amongst empty houses. It almost became a quaint place hidden in the middle of busy streets. We were seated outdoor in a lovely garden. Menu was quite interesting - it's probably because I'm not experienced with Middle Eastern food. We had 2 dishes to share and my apology for not having the exact name but they are: 1. a BIG pile of burrata on top of buttery bread - I'm biased from having Osteria Mozza the night before so this can not match up, but I would say it's not too bad 2. salmon pancake - which I thought was quite delicious, a good combination of sweetness from the pancakes and saltiness from the smoked salmon. Artichoke seemed to be very generous with its portion and the two of us were so stuffed after those 2 dishes :)We had a look at the Overdough bakery and everything looked so delicious. I will definitely come back to try some baked goods!"

The seasonal beef special reminds me of the specialty back in my hometown, Taiwan - the famous beef noodles.

The décor of this place is quite rustic, and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in New York City where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else.   As for our first experience, we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated (around 2pm). Although I was dying for some fried chicken, the second best thing available on the menu - mushroom scrabbled egg - was just equally delicious. They do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table.Personally I enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch. The menu is bigger - about 10 mezzes and 10 entrees, plus some side dishes. The must haves - pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze, burrata and prawns from the entrée. It's not a late night place as their last kitchen call comes before 9:30."

We often feel we need our Artichoke fix so we go about once a month. Bjorn does amazing things with food and he doesn't apologize for anything. He constantly tries new flavor combinations and clearly works them out until they are delicious. His cauliflower is something I dream about at night. The fried chicken is out of this world and the prawns are unexplainable you just have to try them for yourself. The ambience is also our favorite because we always feel welcome, comfortable, and relaxed. It's like you are dining in your favorite Uncles house and you don't need to impress anyone.

The food here is not ""all that"". Its really not. The reality is that this place has bland food that ""looks and sounds good"". First we ordered the hummus. They say they make it on site. I call BS on that. If they are making it they are doing it wrong. It tastes and looks store bought. Well, not even that good. All they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil. Thats it, its bland, tasteless, and just boring. Next, we had the fried cauliflower, again boring and nothing special. It looks great but has no flavor. After that the fried chicken and beef ribs. They both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through. With the chicken, all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it, the breading, and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce. The ribs were just sweet and tender. None of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat. Finally we had the famous ""sticky date pudding"", this was just taking the piss. Its just watered down peanut butter, with grass jelly, topped with ground up Chinese peanut cakes and sugar. No dates, nothing sticky, and NO flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes. A great example of ""up selling"". They use really cheap ingredients, make it look fancy, and sell it for a ton of money. This last dish made me feel like I was a rube getting fleeced. I bet their food costs are 5%. I wish the food in Singapore was as good as the food in Seoul or Tokyo but its just not. Restaurants like these confirm my opinion. The only good food in Singapore is at Hawker centers. If you go to places like this, its just for atmosphere and not for good food. Its a total waste of money."

Dinner should be fine though.  I was quite surprised by how big the space is inside.  I have passed by several times when I visited Objectifs next door and the restaurant space always looks a bit crammed so I assume it was mostly outdoors.  We were seated in an indoor patio area which has been converted into part of the indoor dining space with natural lighting seeping through the glass ceiling, perfect setting for sunday brunch!  I was delighted to find out that it's a middle eastern themed menu - definitely a welcoming change from the typical steak/eggs benedict) aplenty across the island.  It also reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants Ottolenghi in London.  The first thing that caught my eye on the brunch menu was the Cauliflower Sabbich, essentially a pita bread open sandwich topped with grilled/deep fried cauliflower, hummus, labneh and served with a smoked egg that resembles funnily enough a Chinese ""tea leaves smoked egg"". It's flavorful without being over seasoned, healthy but filling.  We also had the lamb shashouka, which is basically your normal shashouka with shreds of lamb in it.  Again, won't be complete without scooping chunks of it up with pieces of pita bread.   The lemonade was a bit too sweet but otherwise a refreshing cooler in the heat of the Singapore afternoon.  Can't wait to check out their dinner options.  And if you are visiting the afternoon, do drop by at the Objectifs next door, they always have interesting exhibitions and will be a good place to stroll around and burn off some of that food."

Brunch:-Lamb Shakshouka was amazing. Not at all a healthy choice, but very very good (and it wouldn't be a stretch to say all my friends had serious food envy as soon as the dish arrived).-Mezza platter looked good - your standard mezza platter.-Scrambled eggs looked pretty good as well...but with all the bacon / pork belly on the side the plate was very very greasy / oily and it was rather off-putting for me.. Though I'm sure for some the generous portion of bacon would be a plus!-Our ""appetizers"" of haloumi and hummus didn't come until after all of our entrees, but aside from the poor timing they were enjoyable.-Friend had the banana muffin from the dessert window and thoroughly enjoyed it.-When we arrived without a reservation at 11am on Sunday I was told it would be a 1+ hour wait, and that reservations are usually full for brunch by the Wednesday before the weekend. Luckily we were seated after waiting only about 15 minutes, but I would recommend making a rez if you can plan that far in advance!Dinner:After a delicious brunch at Artichoke my friends and I were excited to come back for dinner and to try the desserts. Unfortunately we were rather underwhelmed by the dinner options. -The dinner menu consisted of a number of dished which I would refer to as ""dips"" or ""sides"" - but not actual dinners. Granted there are a couple full dinner options - maybe 4? Mostly hearty-sounding meat dishes. But there was a serious lack of selection in my opinion. What about my vegetarian friends? Hummus for dinner? There wasn't even a salad on the menu!-My friend and I ordered hummus, the red pepper dip and the grilled cauliflower (the latter it appears was forgotten about as it never came). The two dips, a few drinks, and dessert were enough to fill us up. -Hummus was good - we ordered it again after enjoying it at brunch.-Red pepper dip was weird. It was topped with pomegranate seeds (which were not listed on the menu as part of the dish) and they were really overpowering. Made the dip too sweet, in my opinion.-I had sticky date pudding for dessert. Not what I was expecting - the pudding was topped with what I can only describe as date-flavored jello. I scraped these off and focused on the cake-y part of the dish, and the vanilla sauce.  This was good, but the jello-like topping was weird and I did not enjoy it. -We arrived around 8:45 on Friday evening and were told (despite the more-than-half-empty status of the restaurant) that they were fully booked. Luckily the nice folks at Artichoke were willing to serve my friend and I drinks at one of the side tables (meant to be just for waiting, but not technically part of the restaurant), and then they were able to give us a table for dinner after about 15-20 minutes.Note:-Not sure about the reservation system as when I walked in the wait times I was quoted ended up being rather exaggerated. If you can make a reservation I would suggest it, but if you forgot I would say try your luck walking in.-Dips do not come with bread, you have to pay extra to have something to ""dip"" in your hummus/etc-Service is slow, but always very nice and friendly.-You get a tiny packet of gummy candies as a ""goodbye"" when you leave. So sweet! And yum!"

So far, we've had all three desserts - cookie pie, sticky date pudding, and that milk pudding with rose and strawberry thing that tastes just like bandung. My favorite so far has got to be the sticky date. Coffee wise, the iced mocha is waaaaay too sweet. And why are they charging 50cents more just for it to be iced?Like I said, don't get me wrong. I really enjoy my Artichoke visits. And I love the snarky website. And how the chairs are so thoughtfully placed - three white, one black. Three white, one black. Then three black, one white.

I loved it's convenient location in the city, and near the Bras Basah MRT, yet it is somehow quietly tucked away in a corner complete with a lovely cobblestoned courtyard, bamboo plants and dim lighting.The service there is excellent - the staff are attentive and a chatty manager checked in on my table to see if you are enjoying the food. He was also helpful in recommending dishes and wines or drinks that go with the food. This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore for Moorish food. The dinners here are more social as we all ordered dishes to share, rather than a main each. Expect very different flavours from what you are used to. The lamb here is incredibly tender, and does not have a strong gamey smell or taste. Even people who do not usually eat lamb found it very good here!My favourite exotic dish was the Forgotten Grain Salad - finally something healthy that isn't all green and tastes great! The slow roasted pork belly had incredibly crispy crackling and the meat melted in my mouth. We also ordered the organic mushrooms that had been grown on a local farm. Artichoke currently has a project to grow their own herbs and vegetables - which I think is just incredible!The desserts there are made by them as well, and I have to say, they really take the cake. The salted caramel sticky date pudding was my absolute favourite. It came in a generous portion as well. We also had the basil cheescake with fresh watermelon balls... and the flavours were divine. I could not believe how great the combination was!We really enjoyed all the amazing dishes, and I'm looking forward to trying their brunch menu soon!

And what better way to recover from a hangover than sangria at 11am?It was with this thought in mind that I made my way to Artichoke Cafe & Bar on a Tuesday for some breakfast and good company.With no reservation, we were forced to sit outside, although we were lucky that it was a relatively cool day in Singapore. Tucked away in the courtyard behind two buildings, we were suddenly transported away from present-day Singapore to colonial Singapore. The wicker chairs, the red-painted outer wall of the cafe, the white-paneled windows and doors... the place had its charms, no doubt. But would it live up to its potential?Artichoke's brunch menu is relatively simple, although I could see the ingredients were high quality and a lot of thought had been put into piecing together the items on the menu. The quality menu was lost on its servers though, who were clueless as to what the menu contained, what the ingredients were, and what they themselves were doing there. Needless to say, service was slow and confusing, but it was hard to be mad at the servers who were so utterly clueless. It would be like scolding newborns!I started off with a sangria to put me in the mood for a slow day. Instead, I was jolted awake by how absolutely awful the sangria tasted. It seemed like their idea of sangria was citrus soda with white wine. A place like this couldn't afford to cut up some real fruits for a sangria? Sangria is such a straight-forward drink, how could they screw that up? I wasn't feeling the love. What they gave me was barely drinkable, so I let it sit and watched the condensation slide down the glass as we waited for our food.I opted for the scrambled eggs and bacon chop, which turned out to be a good decision. The maple-glazed bacon chop was thick and meaty, with just enough fat to be tender and fragrant. The scrambled eggs were on the runny side, purposefully so.I also tried my friend's hash browns, which were crisp and delicious (and oily, as hash browns go). Originally, I asked for ketchup to go with the eggs and hash browns, but they said the kitchen didn't have any. A brunch place that does not have any ketchup? Just as I was working myself into a huff, I asked if they had maple syrup and, lo and behold, they did! The tension was quickly diffused as I embraced my Canadianism and poured a generous portion of maple syrup over everything on my plate.While the food turned out to be good, the service was in a constant state of hopeless confusion, and the sangria was an unmistakable failure. I would probably not return unless a friend of mine decided to host a meal here, and even then it would only be for the ambiance."

And artichoke has always satisfied and put me into a medi- mood for weeks after I dine there. They did it again with their awesome mezzes on the menu for just $7/dish $20/ 3dishes . I have my Turkish haunts when I have that itch for endless eggplants, but talking about true comfort meeting epicurean, try this 'middle eatery/ modern eastern' establishment. Great food prep, principles, and ethical food business and practices I very proudly would pay to dine. Simply, they deserve it. So back to mezzes, I personally am head over heels over the babaganoush and the tarama. Bjorn, owner/chef, nailed the eggplant's savouriness with the smoky tender silky mouthfeel all in the babaganoush. The tarama-ish dip is not some caviar, but its pale creaminess that gives that slight fishy, (or as I would like to perceive as the goodness of the sea) is from smoked oyster! Honestly, balancing all those big flavours, with the right mouthfeel nailed it. I shamelessly used my finger and wiped the plate as I was speaking to some people I've just met for the first time of my life. Soooooooooo, I guess, Artichoke won?"

The food here is fresh and full of garlicky, olive-oil goodness. When we asked the waiter about the type of cuisine here, he stated that it consists of ""Syrian, Lebanese, Greek"" influences.  Basically, it is a Mediterranean medley and it is common for your table to share a few dishes.  Appetizers - The mezzo - fresh hummus, red pepper dip, pickled octopus, anchovies - are all fresh and very tasty here.Entrees - I've only eaten here for dinner and have also taken part in ""lambgasm"" (a 2.2 kg feast of lamb with sides).  While the lamb and beef are cooked well, I really like the vegetarian options here as well. The cauliflower and broccoli dishes are both caramelized to perfection and topped with some type of garlic/anchovy sauce.  It is salty, tangy, and completely delicious.Dessert - Mmm, sticky date pudding.  I haven't had any of the ""underdoughs"" desserts but the baklava and tarts at least look great!The inability to split bills is a little odd as was a call to alter a reservation once (it took 2 minutes for the waitress to understand I had an existing reservation and just wanted to move the time).  But the small packet of gummy worms at the end of every meal put me in a better mood."

However the food was good (I wouldn't go so far as 'great') with plenty of choices and attentive service. A cafe cum restaurant with a tapas-mediterranean-meze-fusion style menu... I think Artichoke is having a bit of an identity crisis as I'm not sure what sort of brand it's going for (if it's going for one at all) I would suggest coming here with a group of friends. We ordered everything from salads, to breads, to meats to poultry, to dessert. I especially the flat breads and the quinoa rice salad. The mushies were also delish. Apparently the menu changes regularly and the owner/chef travels abroad once a year to get inspiration as well as contribute to the local community of wherever they are visiting. Along with 2-3 drinks each, we spent approx $75 pp. I don't remember any music playing while we were there... so I'd recommend some background sounds to add some ambience. The small paper bag of candy given to us on the way out was a nice treat. I'd be interested to see how brunch is... there's alfresco dining in the courtyard which is appealing. But in the meantime, a good spot for evening imbibing with friends."

Park along Waterloo Street or Fortune Centre.We had:1) Slow-Roasted Lamb Shoulder ($38): sumptuous and hearty and rich but balanced, with meat so soft it practically fell off the bone. One of the very best lamb I've ever had in my life.2) Smoked Chicken ($30): succulent and perfumed with a heady char3) Greenland Halibut Fish Fingers ($28): loved the pairing with velvety squid ink tartare sauce4) Duck Adana Kebab Tacos ($18 per pair): may not have received the same amount of love as the preceding dishes, but I liked it well enough. It was texturally meaty, and its intense potency was countered by crisp apple strips, shaved radish, a drizzling of lively garlic chive oil and creamy avocado hummus. 5) Charred Broccoli ($16) strewn with a piquant hodgepodge of miso vinaigrette, crumbed feta, pickled garlic, pickled shimeiji and mint.

An outdoor patio (covered, thank goodness) as well as seating indoors. I was there just before opening but the staff were very pleasant, giving me a menu to look at while they busied themselves getting ready. Once inside and seated at the bar (I was by myself, so that seemed the best option - also I didn't have a reservation and they were clearly going to be busy that night) I met the manager, Ronnie, and was immediately charmed. The beer was frosty and cold (-1 C, according to the fridge), and the music was excellent; very edgy but not off-putting or too loud. I ordered the ""chef's menu"" and was blown away. Everything was excellent, from the starters to the main courses to the dessert. Presentation was artful but not fussy. Loved the range of flavours, the wood-smoked beef was a particular hit (they have a wood fire oven in the kitchen). It is definitely on my list of places to return to."

Though it's slightly on the pricey side, the portion was huge and we actually shared 2 main dishes among 4 girlies. We ordered the Duck and the Chicken. Though the duck was more moist in texture, the flavour was not as great as the Chicken. The chicken would have also been more enjoyable if it wasnt as dry. Overall, good taste but a slight mis-match in terms of the texture.The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and generally a nice place to hang out.

In fact it might be my top recommended place for it because of how unique it is. Instead of your usual indie cafe that sells poached eggs drenched in hollandaise sauce and some salads for $18 bucks, Artichoke has more of an Egyptian or middle eastern influences to their cuisine. It shows in their brunch sets too, with the use of feta cheese and hummus etc.My favorite is actually a very simple dish - the scrambled eggs with rocket, feta cheese, and organic mushrooms. Those mushrooms! If this is what organic tastes like I won't mind having all my food be organic. It's really delicious.For the more carnivorous humans, they also have the same combi expect with mushrooms replaced with a bacon chop. When they say bacon chop, don't think of thin strips but a slab of three-layered pork. Very intimidating looking but also delicious and satisfying!Do remember to check the opening times for the place.

The house-made lemonade had a nice kick and freshness to it.I wish I could have the Lamb Shakshouka again - super tender lamb that fell apart easily, surrounded by a rich tomato sauce.If you want some savory brunch dishes (no pancakes or french toast here), this is the place to go!"

The cauliflower was deliciously salted and breaded, and the dressing was tasty.Cuttlefish shawarma, chicken fat dressing, lime ($25) - 3.75 starsThe texture of the cuttlefish was excellent - not too rubbery and grilled just right. But... how is a chicken fat dressing anything less than flavourful?Green harissa prawns, split cream, charred onions ($38) - 4.5 starsThis came with four large prawns cooked right, and a delicious spicy harissa that was wonderful for dipping bread into.Malabi - ruby peach pudding, bergamot ice, white chocolate ($16) - 2.5 starsThe flavours just didn't go well together. The white chocolate on top seemed gimmicky and the bergamot was too sour. I enjoyed the pudding, but it was par for the course.Date pudding, smoked milk, cashew caramel, coffee jelly ($16) - 3 starsThe date pudding was delicious, and so was the crunchy cashew caramel on top. I enjoyed the coffee jelly yes, but it seemed a little out of place.We tried to make a reservation for a Saturday night but they were fully booked so we walked in at 7.30pm and managed to get a table.

The main entrance is directly opposite Fortune Center (the yellow and white building along Middle Road) and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al-fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community. If you're coming from the side door, it is just next to Torte café (the brownie is to die for) at the end of Waterloo Street. I've dined at Artichoke a couple of times (both on weekend brunch and dinner) and always had the best time here. For brunch, you need to come for their Mezza platter (perfect for 2) which consist of 4 mezze (usually babaganoush, hummus, beetroot and smoked salmon) and a few slices of toasted bread. I suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive. One portion is never enough all the time! For dinner last night, we had the usual mezze plates of hummus, babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken, burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share. All the mains were delicious and I wished we ordered second or third of the burrata (I can eat burrata everyday). The deep fried cauliflower was amazing too, the best I've tried in Singapore after Pony Dining in Eagle Strret Pier, Brisbane. Flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture. HEAVEN. The grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender. What makes it so special is the garlic puree (no kissing after eating this, so you have been forewarned) that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it. Do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you're into trying something new. I've heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here. Well, I think it all depends on what you order and how you order. They have their best seller - The ""Lambgasm"" - a 2.8kg bone-in-lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at $220. So of course, if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails, the bill will definitely come up to $300 - $400.  The four of us ordered 4 mezze plates, 3 mains with no drinks and we paid a total of $124 ($28 each) last night. Considering the food we ate, the price was relatively cheap and reasonable. And we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice (not extremely full or bloated) and very satisfied with dinner. It can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner, so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment."

Food was great, a nice change from the typical cafe fare; my only gripe was the cold service. We tried:- Cauliflower Sabbich ($22): I personally enjoyed this, though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted/grilled, and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture. This had a slightly soggy feel to it. The Israeli salad provided some tang, which I liked, and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk - would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though. Overall a tasty dish.- Haloumi & Mushrooms ($22): The best dish of the 3, in my opinion. The toast was thick and fluffy, with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms. The best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast - it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado, haloumi and mushroom all in one bite. - Artichoke Fried Chicken ($24): 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns, which went nicely with the garlic whip. Slightly too greasy for me, and the chicken had a hint of honey. Didn't enjoy the coleslaw, but the chicken was flavorful. We didn't finish this.Good quality and novel food, would return to try their intriguing dinner menu!"

I would describe the decor as Rustic chic, if that makes any sense.., complemented by a full array of old school pop songs to set the vibe. In layman's terms, a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting.The food itself is just tremendous. My wife and I started off with the Pita and hummus. It was spot on. Next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder. Wow, simply wow. The meat just fell off the bone after the first cut, which is a testament to how tender it was. Mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs, this dish easily was the star of the meal.  The other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish. It was very good, but surprisingly sweet. I probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash. Nevertheless, these dishes on their own are just fantastic.We topped the dinner off with Artichoke's Neh Neh Pops. I went for the Mango Sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango. After the first bite, it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller.  Common, how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango. Great food, Great Vibe, Great Company. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes, but of course order that lamb shoulder again."

They are small dishes for 2-4 people.For sides we had the feta burrata, broccoli salad, and the green beans and beet.

We finally ordered the lamb and chicken entrees, as well as the broccoli, brussel sprouts, hummus, egg plant, and beets appetizers to share, with three orders of pita bread. They completed botched our order- three of the dishes were wrong, and when we asked for the correct dishes, it took an additional 45 minutes to get the proper dishes delivered. By that point, everything was cold, and the serving sizes were tiny- definitely not enough to share. So we ended up having to order more.

The décor of this place is quite rustic, and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in New York City where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else.   As for our first experience, we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated (around 2pm). Although I was dying for some fried chicken, the second best thing available on the menu - mushroom scrabbled egg - was just equally delicious. They do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table.Personally I enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch. The menu is bigger - about 10 mezzes and 10 entrees, plus some side dishes. The must haves - pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze, burrata and prawns from the entrée.

We often feel we need our Artichoke fix so we go about once a month. Bjorn does amazing things with food and he doesn't apologize for anything. He constantly tries new flavor combinations and clearly works them out until they are delicious. His cauliflower is something I dream about at night. The fried chicken is out of this world and the prawns are unexplainable you just have to try them for yourself. The ambience is also our favorite because we always feel welcome, comfortable, and relaxed. It's like you are dining in your favorite Uncles house and you don't need to impress anyone.

This is one of those places that makes me think its reviews are all fake. All of the raves of this place must be fake or by people who have no idea what food should taste like. The food here is not ""all that"". Its really not. The reality is that this place has bland food that ""looks and sounds good"". First we ordered the hummus. They say they make it on site. I call BS on that. If they are making it they are doing it wrong. It tastes and looks store bought. Well, not even that good. All they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil. Thats it, its bland, tasteless, and just boring. Next, we had the fried cauliflower, again boring and nothing special. It looks great but has no flavor. After that the fried chicken and beef ribs. They both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through. With the chicken, all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it, the breading, and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce. The ribs were just sweet and tender. None of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat. Finally we had the famous ""sticky date pudding"", this was just taking the piss. Its just watered down peanut butter, with grass jelly, topped with ground up Chinese peanut cakes and sugar. No dates, nothing sticky, and NO flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes. A great example of ""up selling"". They use really cheap ingredients, make it look fancy, and sell it for a ton of money. This last dish made me feel like I was a rube getting fleeced. I bet their food costs are 5%. I wish the food in Singapore was as good as the food in Seoul or Tokyo but its just not. Restaurants like these confirm my opinion. The only good food in Singapore is at Hawker centers. If you go to places like this, its just for atmosphere and not for good food. Its a total waste of money."

Dinner should be fine though.  I was quite surprised by how big the space is inside.  I have passed by several times when I visited Objectifs next door and the restaurant space always looks a bit crammed so I assume it was mostly outdoors.  We were seated in an indoor patio area which has been converted into part of the indoor dining space with natural lighting seeping through the glass ceiling, perfect setting for sunday brunch!  I was delighted to find out that it's a middle eastern themed menu - definitely a welcoming change from the typical steak/eggs benedict) aplenty across the island.  It also reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants Ottolenghi in London.  The first thing that caught my eye on the brunch menu was the Cauliflower Sabbich, essentially a pita bread open sandwich topped with grilled/deep fried cauliflower, hummus, labneh and served with a smoked egg that resembles funnily enough a Chinese ""tea leaves smoked egg"". It's flavorful without being over seasoned, healthy but filling.  We also had the lamb shashouka, which is basically your normal shashouka with shreds of lamb in it.  Again, won't be complete without scooping chunks of it up with pieces of pita bread.   The lemonade was a bit too sweet but otherwise a refreshing cooler in the heat of the Singapore afternoon.  Can't wait to check out their dinner options.  And if you are visiting the afternoon, do drop by at the Objectifs next door, they always have interesting exhibitions and will be a good place to stroll around and burn off some of that food."

Brunch:-Lamb Shakshouka was amazing. Not at all a healthy choice, but very very good (and it wouldn't be a stretch to say all my friends had serious food envy as soon as the dish arrived).-Mezza platter looked good - your standard mezza platter.-Scrambled eggs looked pretty good as well...but with all the bacon / pork belly on the side the plate was very very greasy / oily and it was rather off-putting for me.. Though I'm sure for some the generous portion of bacon would be a plus!-Our ""appetizers"" of haloumi and hummus didn't come until after all of our entrees, but aside from the poor timing they were enjoyable.-Friend had the banana muffin from the dessert window and thoroughly enjoyed it.-When we arrived without a reservation at 11am on Sunday I was told it would be a 1+ hour wait, and that reservations are usually full for brunch by the Wednesday before the weekend. Luckily we were seated after waiting only about 15 minutes, but I would recommend making a rez if you can plan that far in advance!Dinner:After a delicious brunch at Artichoke my friends and I were excited to come back for dinner and to try the desserts. Unfortunately we were rather underwhelmed by the dinner options. -The dinner menu consisted of a number of dished which I would refer to as ""dips"" or ""sides"" - but not actual dinners. Granted there are a couple full dinner options - maybe 4? Mostly hearty-sounding meat dishes. But there was a serious lack of selection in my opinion. What about my vegetarian friends? Hummus for dinner? There wasn't even a salad on the menu!-My friend and I ordered hummus, the red pepper dip and the grilled cauliflower (the latter it appears was forgotten about as it never came). The two dips, a few drinks, and dessert were enough to fill us up. -Hummus was good - we ordered it again after enjoying it at brunch.-Red pepper dip was weird. It was topped with pomegranate seeds (which were not listed on the menu as part of the dish) and they were really overpowering. Made the dip too sweet, in my opinion.-I had sticky date pudding for dessert. Not what I was expecting - the pudding was topped with what I can only describe as date-flavored jello. I scraped these off and focused on the cake-y part of the dish, and the vanilla sauce.  This was good, but the jello-like topping was weird and I did not enjoy it. -We arrived around 8:45 on Friday evening and were told (despite the more-than-half-empty status of the restaurant) that they were fully booked. Luckily the nice folks at Artichoke were willing to serve my friend and I drinks at one of the side tables (meant to be just for waiting, but not technically part of the restaurant), and then they were able to give us a table for dinner after about 15-20 minutes.Note:-Not sure about the reservation system as when I walked in the wait times I was quoted ended up being rather exaggerated. If you can make a reservation I would suggest it, but if you forgot I would say try your luck walking in.-Dips do not come with bread, you have to pay extra to have something to ""dip"" in your hummus/etc-Service is slow, but always very nice and friendly.-You get a tiny packet of gummy candies as a ""goodbye"" when you leave. So sweet! And yum!"

We usually pop in at very strange hours. Like 10pm and zoom in to the dessert menu. So far, we've had all three desserts - cookie pie, sticky date pudding, and that milk pudding with rose and strawberry thing that tastes just like bandung. My favorite so far has got to be the sticky date. Coffee wise, the iced mocha is waaaaay too sweet. And why are they charging 50cents more just for it to be iced?Like I said, don't get me wrong. I really enjoy my Artichoke visits. And I love the snarky website. And how the chairs are so thoughtfully placed - three white, one black. Three white, one black. Then three black, one white.

I loved it's convenient location in the city, and near the Bras Basah MRT, yet it is somehow quietly tucked away in a corner complete with a lovely cobblestoned courtyard, bamboo plants and dim lighting.The service there is excellent - the staff are attentive and a chatty manager checked in on my table to see if you are enjoying the food. He was also helpful in recommending dishes and wines or drinks that go with the food. This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore for Moorish food. The dinners here are more social as we all ordered dishes to share, rather than a main each. Expect very different flavours from what you are used to. The lamb here is incredibly tender, and does not have a strong gamey smell or taste. Even people who do not usually eat lamb found it very good here!My favourite exotic dish was the Forgotten Grain Salad - finally something healthy that isn't all green and tastes great! The slow roasted pork belly had incredibly crispy crackling and the meat melted in my mouth. We also ordered the organic mushrooms that had been grown on a local farm. Artichoke currently has a project to grow their own herbs and vegetables - which I think is just incredible!The desserts there are made by them as well, and I have to say, they really take the cake. The salted caramel sticky date pudding was my absolute favourite. It came in a generous portion as well. We also had the basil cheescake with fresh watermelon balls... and the flavours were divine. I could not believe how great the combination was!We really enjoyed all the amazing dishes, and I'm looking forward to trying their brunch menu soon! Their menu does change fairly often, so drop in and try those delectable dishes before they're off the menu!"

And what better way to recover from a hangover than sangria at 11am?It was with this thought in mind that I made my way to Artichoke Cafe & Bar on a Tuesday for some breakfast and good company.With no reservation, we were forced to sit outside, although we were lucky that it was a relatively cool day in Singapore. Tucked away in the courtyard behind two buildings, we were suddenly transported away from present-day Singapore to colonial Singapore. The wicker chairs, the red-painted outer wall of the cafe, the white-paneled windows and doors... the place had its charms, no doubt. But would it live up to its potential?Artichoke's brunch menu is relatively simple, although I could see the ingredients were high quality and a lot of thought had been put into piecing together the items on the menu. The quality menu was lost on its servers though, who were clueless as to what the menu contained, what the ingredients were, and what they themselves were doing there. Needless to say, service was slow and confusing, but it was hard to be mad at the servers who were so utterly clueless. It would be like scolding newborns!I started off with a sangria to put me in the mood for a slow day. Instead, I was jolted awake by how absolutely awful the sangria tasted. It seemed like their idea of sangria was citrus soda with white wine. A place like this couldn't afford to cut up some real fruits for a sangria? Sangria is such a straight-forward drink, how could they screw that up? I wasn't feeling the love. What they gave me was barely drinkable, so I let it sit and watched the condensation slide down the glass as we waited for our food.I opted for the scrambled eggs and bacon chop, which turned out to be a good decision. The maple-glazed bacon chop was thick and meaty, with just enough fat to be tender and fragrant. The scrambled eggs were on the runny side, purposefully so.I also tried my friend's hash browns, which were crisp and delicious (and oily, as hash browns go). Originally, I asked for ketchup to go with the eggs and hash browns, but they said the kitchen didn't have any. A brunch place that does not have any ketchup? Just as I was working myself into a huff, I asked if they had maple syrup and, lo and behold, they did! The tension was quickly diffused as I embraced my Canadianism and poured a generous portion of maple syrup over everything on my plate.While the food turned out to be good, the service was in a constant state of hopeless confusion, and the sangria was an unmistakable failure. I would probably not return unless a friend of mine decided to host a meal here, and even then it would only be for the ambiance."

I held back because I know the menu I had relished isn't quite the same and reviewing it before I went back for its main stays right now would be a waste of time to read. Well, since I have been teased aptly on this day for being the first ROTD (due to technical glitches previously that rigged this honour for me) here's my review of Artichoke that comes highly recommended.I am a middle eastern somewhere in my gut/belly. And artichoke has always satisfied and put me into a medi- mood for weeks after I dine there. They did it again with their awesome mezzes on the menu for just $7/dish $20/ 3dishes . I have my Turkish haunts when I have that itch for endless eggplants, but talking about true comfort meeting epicurean, try this 'middle eatery/ modern eastern' establishment. Great food prep, principles, and ethical food business and practices I very proudly would pay to dine. Simply, they deserve it. So back to mezzes, I personally am head over heels over the babaganoush and the tarama. Bjorn, owner/chef, nailed the eggplant's savouriness with the smoky tender silky mouthfeel all in the babaganoush. The tarama-ish dip is not some caviar, but its pale creaminess that gives that slight fishy, (or as I would like to perceive as the goodness of the sea) is from smoked oyster! Honestly, balancing all those big flavours, with the right mouthfeel nailed it. I shamelessly used my finger and wiped the plate as I was speaking to some people I've just met for the first time of my life. Soooooooooo, I guess, Artichoke won?"

The food here is fresh and full of garlicky, olive-oil goodness. When we asked the waiter about the type of cuisine here, he stated that it consists of ""Syrian, Lebanese, Greek"" influences.  Basically, it is a Mediterranean medley and it is common for your table to share a few dishes.  Appetizers - The mezzo - fresh hummus, red pepper dip, pickled octopus, anchovies - are all fresh and very tasty here.Entrees - I've only eaten here for dinner and have also taken part in ""lambgasm"" (a 2.2 kg feast of lamb with sides).  While the lamb and beef are cooked well, I really like the vegetarian options here as well. The cauliflower and broccoli dishes are both caramelized to perfection and topped with some type of garlic/anchovy sauce.  It is salty, tangy, and completely delicious.Dessert - Mmm, sticky date pudding.  I haven't had any of the ""underdoughs"" desserts but the baklava and tarts at least look great!The inability to split bills is a little odd as was a call to alter a reservation once (it took 2 minutes for the waitress to understand I had an existing reservation and just wanted to move the time).  But the small packet of gummy worms at the end of every meal put me in a better mood."

I think Artichoke is having a bit of an identity crisis as I'm not sure what sort of brand it's going for (if it's going for one at all) I would suggest coming here with a group of friends. We ordered everything from salads, to breads, to meats to poultry, to dessert. I especially the flat breads and the quinoa rice salad. The mushies were also delish. Apparently the menu changes regularly and the owner/chef travels abroad once a year to get inspiration as well as contribute to the local community of wherever they are visiting. Along with 2-3 drinks each, we spent approx $75 pp. I don't remember any music playing while we were there... so I'd recommend some background sounds to add some ambience. The small paper bag of candy given to us on the way out was a nice treat. I'd be interested to see how brunch is... there's alfresco dining in the courtyard which is appealing.

For sure Artichoke's going down as one of 2016's bests eats.PSA: For first-timers to Artichoke, it's at the junction of Waterloo Street and Middle Road; the little restaurant is tucked away in a nook behind this bright yellow heritage chalet-looking building, opposite Fortune Centre and next to the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (""SCWO"") along Waterloo Street. Park along Waterloo Street or Fortune Centre.We had:1) Slow-Roasted Lamb Shoulder ($38): sumptuous and hearty and rich but balanced, with meat so soft it practically fell off the bone. One of the very best lamb I've ever had in my life.2) Smoked Chicken ($30): succulent and perfumed with a heady char3) Greenland Halibut Fish Fingers ($28): loved the pairing with velvety squid ink tartare sauce4) Duck Adana Kebab Tacos ($18 per pair): may not have received the same amount of love as the preceding dishes, but I liked it well enough. It was texturally meaty, and its intense potency was countered by crisp apple strips, shaved radish, a drizzling of lively garlic chive oil and creamy avocado hummus. 5) Charred Broccoli ($16) strewn with a piquant hodgepodge of miso vinaigrette, crumbed feta, pickled garlic, pickled shimeiji and mint. So good we ordered seconds"

It is in a very nice location on Waterloo Road, not far from the MRT. You walk in off the street and right away you get the sense that this place is a little bit different. An outdoor patio (covered, thank goodness) as well as seating indoors. I was there just before opening but the staff were very pleasant, giving me a menu to look at while they busied themselves getting ready. Once inside and seated at the bar (I was by myself, so that seemed the best option - also I didn't have a reservation and they were clearly going to be busy that night) I met the manager, Ronnie, and was immediately charmed. The beer was frosty and cold (-1 C, according to the fridge), and the music was excellent; very edgy but not off-putting or too loud. I ordered the ""chef's menu"" and was blown away. Everything was excellent, from the starters to the main courses to the dessert. Presentation was artful but not fussy. Loved the range of flavours, the wood-smoked beef was a particular hit (they have a wood fire oven in the kitchen). It is definitely on my list of places to return to."

Though it's slightly on the pricey side, the portion was huge and we actually shared 2 main dishes among 4 girlies. We ordered the Duck and the Chicken. Though the duck was more moist in texture, the flavour was not as great as the Chicken. The chicken would have also been more enjoyable if it wasnt as dry. Overall, good taste but a slight mis-match in terms of the texture.The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and generally a nice place to hang out.

The scrambled eggs at Artichoke are one of the best I have had anywhere, with a creamy smooth yet fluffy texture and seasoned to perfection. They go immensely well with the Roasted Corn and Cherry Tomatoes and complemented the sweet yet savoury Maple-glazed Bacon Chop which is a popular order given that unlike normal, paper-thin bacon, the one served at Artichoke is about 2 cm thick and incredibly sinful-good. Za'atar bread however was overly hard and difficult to enjoy. As good as the scrambled eggs were, the Lamb Shakshouka ($25++) stole the show. Consisting of Eggs in a Skillet w Tomato Sauce, Roast Lamb Shoulder, Kashkaval Cheese, Pistachio Dukka & Za'atar Bread, the Mediterranean brunch item is a refreshing change from the usual eggs and bacon and I am utterly sold by the savoury, mildly spicy dish.

In fact it might be my top recommended place for it because of how unique it is. Instead of your usual indie cafe that sells poached eggs drenched in hollandaise sauce and some salads for $18 bucks, Artichoke has more of an Egyptian or middle eastern influences to their cuisine. It shows in their brunch sets too, with the use of feta cheese and hummus etc.My favorite is actually a very simple dish - the scrambled eggs with rocket, feta cheese, and organic mushrooms. Those mushrooms! If this is what organic tastes like I won't mind having all my food be organic. It's really delicious.For the more carnivorous humans, they also have the same combi expect with mushrooms replaced with a bacon chop. When they say bacon chop, don't think of thin strips but a slab of three-layered pork. Very intimidating looking but also delicious and satisfying!Do remember to check the opening times for the place. It fills up really fast so be sure to make an reservation at least 3 days in advance."

Mock Unagi tasted as though they were the actual with sweet black sauce lying on top of the little rice rice with cucumbers and avocados.Unagi Maki - $15Even at a closer look, they look as good as those in the real Japanese Restaurant.Dishes were getting more interesting in this case with 3 kinds of Sashimi, mock tuna, salmon and sword fish. The presentation and food art was stunning, how did they make the ""veins"" on the fish look so real? Arrangement of food with wasabi on the bed of ice made no different as what we have someone where!Three Kind Sashimi - $19Texture was smooth and these mocked sashimi did give fellow vegetarians a very good indication of how actual sashimi taste like, lessing the natural ""fishy"" taste.The crispy and uniform cuts of the piece of deep fried meat looks none other than a slab of delicious Pork Tonkatsu pairing up with garden salad and its dressing. The texture and bite may resemble an actual pork fillet but the taste still could not hide the fact that its a piece of vegetarian product with hints of mushrooms and yam.Pork Fillet - $11Buckwheat Noodle with toufu skin and mushroom broth is delighting. Beside the smooth buckwheat noodle, fried tempura bits had given the dishes another level of texture in the dish.Buckwheat NoodleLast but not least, the grains! Fried Rice was unexpectedly scrumptious and every mouth came with a whiff of wok fire taste! Incredible! Grains were topped with brown sea vegetables (hijiki) and these vegetables are part of Japanese diet for centuries as they are rich in dietary fibre and minerals such as calcium, iron and magnesium. Who says only red meats give iron?Hjiki Fried Rice - $9Special thanks to my pal who insisted that I should give Teng Bespoke a try and it gave me another view point of having Japanese dining in a vegetarian way. One of the servers did mentioned that they have more than 1 overflow room and in fact Teng Bespoke is also serving Thai Vegetarian Food and perhaps this is why we see Lemon Grass Drink available in its menu."

I really wanted to try the green tea or the udon noodle bowl, but since the bowls were massive, I decided to stick with sushi. I ordered the unagi rolls which were awesome. By the time the salmon rolls came along, I was pretty full. But I managed to polish that off as well. I had the mango juice - which was not that great. The service is somewhat slow so be prepared to wait between orders. I also noticed that they tack on a 10% service charge in addition to the Vat.

For first timers, remember that this place is on the ground floor inside the Sunshine Plaza. The main dining area is a bit tight with seating fairly close to one another. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table as it was a busy weekend. Best to call ahead for reservations.And if you're vegetarian, there is also a Thai vegetarian restaurant called Pepper Jade right around the corner in the same plaza.

At the restaurant itself, you will find no such fanfare of a long name - just a single symbol denoting Teng.We landed here on a rainy afternoon to find a packed restaurant. After waiting for a bit, we were served our menus. I like the fact that they have picture menus with item numbers. Yay for ordering simplicity! But boo for charging 50c for hot water! I instead ordered the $2.50 green tea.Among our appetizers, we much enjoyed the mushroom salad - though I was expecting the dressing to be a bit tangier. The lotus root tempura was underwhelming. Too much batter, too little flavour. For our main course, we tried the Unagi roll and the Kaki Ramen. Both were hearty and flavourful, and dare I say that we licked out plates clean! The Kaki ramen noodles were a bit thick but the sesame flavour worked well. I'm not one to comment on how authentic the Unagi was, but it was delicious for sure, sirree.In terms of service, it was pretty friendly though they did make us wait for a while. When I asked if they were open to customizing their dishes with less oil (for a friend with a dietary restriction) they were quite happy to oblige.Overall I think it is a great addition to the vegetarian dining scene in Singapore."

This is not hyperbole or an exaggeration, because of how passionately Singaporeans feel about chicken rice and specifically about the chicken rice at their favorite stall. I like what this place does for Chicken Rice enough to risk life and limb by saying that it's easily in the top three chicken rice choices in Singapore. The only caveat is that portions have gotten smaller over the years, but I respect the fact that they continue to keep the quality high. If you're in the neighborhood especially having a beer at the American tap room, then you could do worse than dropping by here to have Chicken Rice, especially if visiting Singapore for the first time. You won't be disappointed, the chicken is flavorful and juicy especially if you're having thigh or the drumstick.  I personally gravitate towards breast but it's just because I'm a lazy eater. But at Leong Yeow you don't ever need to compromise because you can ask for deboning.  The chili sauce definitely flies the standard for Chicken Rice high here and it's a little on the spicier side so beware. All in all there are many good reasons why Leong Yeow is one of my favorite go to places for Chicken Rice in Singapore."

My own personal finiky point is - that if you don't eat meat, you don't need to still call it chicken/salmon/beef whatever, us vegetarians are eating it for a vegetable. Anyhow, it certainly fooled my omniverous partner into eating a fully vegetarian dinner, and for that I salute you. It was an awesome way to finish our trip in Singapore and one of the most memorable meals we have ever eaten, if not for my panicked reaction of - wait, did I order duck? No, it's vegetarian duck.

From the owners of stranger Union is curious palette! Opened in 2015, this interesting and rustic looking cafe can accommodate huge groups of diners in its two storey shop house cafe!Looking at the menu, they offer soft shell crab burger, chicken, western fares as well as interesting sounding buttermilk waffles and hot cakes that have taken over Instagram!! They also have a wide selection of cakes. All very vibrantly colored to emphasize the flavours!! The range from $8 and up!1. Matcha Azuki Cake $8.50++I'm a green tea lover and this cake was calling my name. Although, I did feel that this cake was too articially coloured. The green was too vibrant for my eyes. Nonetheless, I dug in and disappointingly, I couldn't really taste the green tea but the azuki (red beans) sweet and pretty much ended up causing the cake to taste like a red bean cake. I didn't even bother to finish up this cake. Skip this cake and get the earl grey lavender manjari cake instead, save your $10.2. Nachos Con Carne $12.90++ *Highly Recommended*With slow-cooked hand-pulled pork, sour cream, jalapeno and melted cheddar. I really liked the pulled pork here, it was well seasoned, tender and also extremely flavourful. The salsa here was abit too sour for my liking. This dish could've used a bit more cheddar, there really wasn't enough cheddar, more than 3/4 of the nachos didn't have cheese on it. Probably one of the most underated dish at Curious Palette, as I hardly saw anyone ordering it! Do try it! You will like it! Truffle fries are overated anyways! Have some meat with your carb!3. Cafe Mocha $5.50++ A nice cup of mocha to perk me up during my later afternoon at Curious Palette. A good balance of chocolate and coffee. This fared alot better than the iced mocha, which literally was too diluted before the ice even began to melt.4. Iced Mocha $6.90++A very typical iced mocha, nothing fancy. It had chocolate powder on top of it. It tasted kinda of diluted, not a very strong chocolate, milk or coffee taste. I was kind of disappointed in this drink, considering the price that you pay and the fact they they had easily 4 staff behind the coffee counter. 5. Earl Grey Lavender Manjari Cake $8++ *Highly Recommended*This was the first cake that caught my eye in the cake display. It had a slight blue-ish purple colouring on the top. There were several layers to the cake, which the staff described as ""chocolate layers"" And indeed they were. They were chocolate ganache layers that had a lavender aroma and taste! The fragrance of the lavender was subtle but yet enough for me to pick it up! The cake was on the slightly dryer side, wasn't as moist as I had hoped it to be. But everyone on the table agreed, it was one of the most interesting cake we had ever come across!6. Pina Colada Tea $7.50This was a very interesting tea, as it tasted very fruity and even without sugar, there was a hint of sweetness. The sweet aroma itself, made me wonder about what ingredients were used to make this tea! Served in a tea pot, it's a pretty tea set that comes with this order.7. Berry Ricotta Hotcake $12.90++ *Highly Recommended*With vanilla bean ice cream, fresh seasonal berries, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seed. These are breakfast pancakes summer-style, ridiculously light, and lemony somehow! They are crispy like a biscuit on the edges and super soft and fluffy on the inside. Almost like eating a freshly baked moist cupcake!If you imagine the flavour of cheesecake combined with a texture that's best, if wordily, described as a kind of souffled griddle cake, you're somewhere near getting the measure of these.In my view, this is their fabulous delicacy and, besides, there is some accompanying fruit allows you to delude yourself that these are healthy.8. Spam Fries $11.90++These spam fries served with Kaffir lime mayo, which tasted like plain mayo. No lime fragrant or taste was evident. The spam fries though were slightly softer and tender in texture in comparison to other spam fries I've tried. The edgers weren't crispy though, they were just hard.Overall : It's quite expensive considering you have to pay 7% GST and 10% service charge. It can get quiet full, so do call and make a reservation. The food isn't all that great. Although I didn't try any mains, I did see alot of people order the soft shell crab at $22++. I would only come here for the Earl Grey Lavender Manjari cake or the Hotcakes."

The only deviation from the hipster template comes in the form of the thumping club techno that's loud enough to make you speak just a bit louder than you'd normally do in a café. The place is definitely well decorated, and the lighting and layout seems almost deliberately set up for patrons to take instagram-worthy photos of their very photogenic food. Popped by for a coffee, so can't say much about the food. Friends had several variations of milky coffee, and I had a Kalita'd Finca Santa Teresa. The drip coffee was well executed, and highlighted all the rich, chocolatey, berry notes of the coffee. Craft beer menu looks decent as well - Brewdog Dead Pony Club and Green Goblin on draught, and a slew of very drinkable craft bottles. Would pop by again if I'm in the area. Despite the hipster trappings, seems like a place I'd enjoy returning to. Now if only they'd turn the damn music down a notch or two..."

Located at a row of shop houses, this restaurant is easily recognised without a signboard. We were there with our goggle map showing us that we were at the right spot, but looking around, we saw signboards of others except for this one and when we went closer for a look, we saw the signboard in small blackboard on a chair. I am not too sure whether I am impressed with this idea. Stepping inside, I saw many paintings of Asian arts on the walls and it was pretty crowded. We had to wait for a while before our table was ready. As hungry as a bear I ordered the $22 plus Chicken leg, why so expensive? I was curious to find out. My friend's meal came quite fast while mine seemed to take forever to come (15 minutes later in fact) and my jaws almost dropped when I saw the portion of it. It was ok on the whole especially with the rice - I thought it was not bad. However, I wasn't full at that point as the portion to be honest has a lot to be desired. The service on the other hand was average, neither bad or good, guess there weren't enough staff around, but at least we didn't wait long for the bill. Well, I would come back to give it another go to try other dishes."

Service, while not particularly prompt, is polite and attentive.Salmon was well-executed, moist, flavorful and complete with a crispy skin. The guacamole and haloumi were definitely a nice touch, though the bacon scone was a slightly bizarre addition to the dish. Didn't seem to really jive with the other elements on the plate. For the portion, it is on the pricey side though. Pulled pork sandwich was decent, with an adequately thick slice of bread to hold the mound of pulled pork. Egg was also perfectly poached.Truffle fries were awesome and special mention to the truffle aioli. They do, however, charge for topping up the aioli.The lavender manjari was great as a chocolate cake, and while photogenic, the lavender taste was imperceptible.

From the discreet sign outside the restaurant that scribbles ""Curious Palette"" in such a unreadable cursive font, to the ondeh ondeh inspired cake and of course chai tea latte, it's hipster stamped all over it. (Context as to why I used chai tea latte as a hipster barometer. Having recently been to Melbourne that has a super fantastic flare of hipster cafes, for a non-coffee drinker like me, chai tea latte is like the next best substitute for the inability to enjoy the great coffee brew. If you have chai tea latte in your indie lookig cafe, you are hipster certified. At least, in my opinion. Heh)Don't let the exterior of the cafe fool you as its quite a large cafe that stretches deep into the back. Plenty of seats and a pretty nice ambience. My friend had truffle mushroom soup and it was pretty awesome. Fragrant and thick, it's a pretty dense soup. As it was really late, thats about all we had, including a nice huge slide of ondeh ondeh cake. I still prefer the real ondeh ondeh as the beauty of the kuey is really being able to enjoy the sweet and warm hula Melaka burst in your mouth as you bite into it. That's something a cake cannot replicate. Good effort, but just not the same experience.Will be very happy to try it out again and this time, for the mains and the beautiful pancakes!"

We booked some seats at Curious Palette purely because it had pulled pork sandwiches on the menu and that is enough to get me excited. Eating proper meals at hipster cafes is always a risk because they are probably more adept at making coffees or reselling central kitchen cakes, than cooking proper food. That turned out to be the case but I'm not surprised. First, the good thing about Curious Palette is that the cafe is in a fairly long shop house that stretches to the back. There's quite a few tables and waiters/waitresses running around so you can get decent service. The decor is bright and I could see why people would want to hang out here. I arrived for dinner last and was seated at our table for three at a seat with the back facing the ""walkway"" where servers constantly were passing through. It wasn't a great idea because I felt like I was in everyone's way all the time. I ordered a ""wagyu"" burger, while my friends ordered the chicken confit and fried chicken (yes apparently they like fowl), as well as a bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc (the wine list is extremely limited and obviously curated to meet the $50-70 price point so you either get overpriced pedestrian village (in an attempt to satisfy the old world lovers) and a not so overpriced new world selection, since the latter tends to be cheaper anyway...so we went with the latter). My ""wagyu"" burger was tasty with a heavy dose of truffle derivatives/seasoning on it, but the meat/fat wasn't mind blowing so it made me wonder why bother using a low grade of wagyu just for marketing purposes. At the $20-30 range, this is likely to be Australian ""wagyu"" chuck though I would guess the cow is actually a mix breed, given the lack of fat and real flavor. To use a really poor analogy, its like being promised plate of char kuay teow without the fried lard - tastes fine and you can probably hide the lack of lard with some wok hei, but it's not the same. What annoyed me a little more was the doneness - I asked for my patty to be cooked medium because unlike steaks, ground meat can be quite mushy and grotesque when it is below 140F in the middle, which was the case with my burger. I sent back my burger a second time and was told by the kitchen that anything with a medium doneness will usually err on the bloody side and all I've to say is...get a good broiler or a sous vide machine? I am paying at least an arm for this burger. Anyway the accompanying sweet potato fries were fine, the fried chicken my friend ordered was crispy and juicy and the wine did its job (although our glasses were unbelievably frozen and the waiter clearly wasn't trained to pour wine). So yes, a meh passable experience. Maybe it's just me but does hipster = expensive and nothing except the coffee is supposed to taste great?"

The pourovers were clearly poured properly, for example warming both the cone and the cup with hot water before adding filter and grounds. The space is much smaller than I thought from the photos, and very different from your usual hipster coffee hangout. There is no well labelled merchandise impeccably ordered on minimalist japano-swedish shelves, no pastel colour scheme undermining the brutality of the raw concrete and painted building bowels. Think more Ikea furniture packed with coffee making equipment and a small roaster running at the back. If there was food I did not see it. Four sandwiches are written on a board, and seem to be the only option. Coffee beans on sale (Yirgacheffe, 150g for $18; Blue Mountain for $65) were roasted on the 5th of March, a full week ago, which is the only minor issue I could find, but I know some roasters think coffee peaks 5 days after roasting."

He's roasted batches for some friends who've become regulars (and fast friends, especially since their command of Chinese is leagues better than mine), and the range of beans, coupled with the quality of his roast, makes him quite a rare find.Elsie is usually the face of the business, and does great front-end service, and also makes a mean Taiwan-style iced shaken tea, quite like a bubble tea.

Interestingly, they serve waffles, soups and other desserts too.I had a wrap+chicken+5 toppings and my partner had a single salad consisting of 5 toppings. It cost under $16 and was very fulfiling. This is easily one of the most value for money salad places in Singapore, besides cold storage. Others are incredibly overpriced!The staff recommended me to take an extra meat but I declined so it can make me 'full' as I chose mainly light ingredients.  A constant stream of customers arrived, most likely Kaplan students. Happy Tummy is new to market, and I saw on their Fb that they are opening a new outlet at Yishun! Lucky Yishunittes..Definitely coming back to try!"

This is my all-time favourite salad bar. I probably go there twice a week. Fresh ingredients, friendly peeps and so much cheaper than Salad Stop!A Single, gets you a base of romaine and 5 toppings for $6.80. A Double (which supposedly feeds 2 peeps, but I eat it all by myself. Moo!) gets you a generous base of romaine and 8 toppings, all for $10. They also give unlimited herbs and condiments, like basil, oregeno, parsley, fried shallots, garlic and sesame seeds. I usually get the Roasted Sesame or Miso Sesame dressing. Premium items, like spinach, roast chicken or freshly grilled salmon (made in house), cost anything from $1 to $2.50 more each. Even then, my Doubles never cost more than $13. If I went to Salad Stop, I'd get half the amount for the same price. And for half the smiles too. (Alright, I'll stop knocking Salad Stop!) They also serve wraps, soups, ice-cream waffles, cold pressed juices, coffee/tea and baked goods like macaroons, muffins, tarts. But I'm usually there to eat ""clean"", so I just take in the smells. There is a seating area for about 15-20, but it looks a little crammed, so I usually take out. Probably not good for big groups. If you're a student/staff from SMU, Kaplan, NAFA or Lasalle, you get one free additional topping, and if you are from RSM International, the Ascott Limited or Citadines, you get a special discount. They also have a loyalty card. 4 orders gets you a free topping, 8 gets you a free premium, and 13 gets you a free Single salad. I LOVE HAPPY TUMMY!"

I got stuck in Wilkie by the rain. It was lunchtime so I thought why not. The position of the restaurant is quite nice, having the seating in a corner means a spacious view including on the street (seeing the sky in a mall! who'd have thought), although the tables are very close together and you will bump into people. The burger patty definitely came from the freezer as did the sliced Kraft cheese on top. Salad was alright, although a few of the grapes were very soft. The sesame dressing was great, the chef has taste. The lemonade was enjoyable and did not have the cleaning fluid feel of the artificial stuff you find in food courts.  I just want to point out this is not a hipster salad bar with specially imported ingredients, just Cold Storage/Fairprice stuff thrown together at an attractive price, not a destination, but a good place to hang out if you already live here. Definitely a good option for a traditional breakfast, and I guess I should try the salads people are raving about. All in all, but a welcome addition to Wilkie for those of us who just want a simple healthy lunch without paying $20 at any of the mediocre ""food concepts"" nearby. Together with the arrival of Hao Wei Lai opposite, things are looking up in the not-hipster, not-hawker segment for the neighbourhood."

The steamed chicken rice and spare ribs on rice are good for a meal for modest eaters. I like that they add wolfberries to the chicken for a touch of sweet and colour. The ribs are always tender and cooked just right. The prawn dumpling soup has generously stuffed dumplings livened with shredded black fungus and shrimp, crunchy goodness! And the soup is tasty without giving you an msg attack. The glutinous rice with chicken and sausage in lotus leaf is nicely made, and goes superbly with the chilli sauce. And the chilli sauce is the bomb. Made inhouse, it is larded through generously with superbly crispy garlic chips. Love love love that sauce! If they bottle it I would so buy it. The siew mai and char siew buns are also hearty and rustic which is part of their charm. If you know what to expect, this is a good place to pop by for quick cheap eats."

So in addition to having a truly impressive selection, the American Taproom makes it a point to receive only fresh product, store and handle it properly, all in order to serve you the beer the brewer intended you to have.The kitchen at the American Taproom also puts out some really creditable bar food which is hearty, tasty and provides a solid complement to the tap list."

Although it says on the website that it is a Singaporean lifestyle place, I got the impression that was more of a hodgepodge of Asian food. Dishes varied from chicken curry to braised pork rice bowls. It was a little awkward when I ordered as the guy at the counter barely spoke any English. Apparently, the iced tea that I ordered carried an additional surcharge of $0.50 SGD. The food was pretty good for fast casual food. Basically, everything is pre-made and was slopped onto my plate. Despite the fact that it was pre-made, it was still pretty decent regardless and nicely presented. Note, there was air conditioning in this place but some a**hole left the door open letting that precious cold air out escape out the door."

They do have franchises in other countries. But, they just don't taste as good compared to the ones in Singapore. I have to get their Kopi-C here, which is basically their blend of aromatic coffee with creamy and sweet condensed milk. Better than any Starbucks chain. As for their breakfast options, I really don't go for their sweet options. I have tried most of their savory items. My favorite items to order for a hearty breakfast were their Nasi Lemak, Curry Chicken Rice, and my sister's favorite, their braised pork over rice with a roasted chicken leg on the side. All of these dishes were brimming with flavor and packed a wonderful punch. I appreciated that the rice that came with these dishes was aromatic and not mushy. Other noteworthy dishes that were pretty good were their laksa and mee goreng. The noodles in the laksa were broken up into pieces for easy eating. But, this didn't allow much of that laksa broth flavor to be absorbed. We just prefer their spaghetti type noodles more, as far as flavor and texture goes. The laksa broth was also a little bit too creamy from all the coconut milk, in our opinion. The mee goreng noodles were a bit over cooked when I tried it, and the flavor was a little overpowering for me from that shrimp paste. Definitely, cut that strong flavor with the calamansi provided. The pan fried spam was the star of the show in the mee goreng dish.Overall, Toast Box is just a wonderful and consistent food option in Singapore to eat breakfast or lunch. It would be dangerous to have a Toast Box close to home, since I practically ate Toast Box almost every morning. Not necessarily good for that waistline. Lol. At least I can splurge on my diet while in Singapore. They're practically everywhere in Singapore (like an Asian McDonald's). It's worth mentioning that their savory items are $8 USD or less.

Their specialty is the Mongolian pork rib which is heavenly. The ribs are not cut into small cubes and there are still huge chunks of meat stuck to it. Perhaps it's not favourable for dainty ladies that will be paiseh to hold up the bones and rip the meat off; I have no qualms for that =D  The ribs has a very unique taste; creamy, peppery and there's a hint of mint. The sauce is very appetising and I can finish my whole of rice just with the sauce alone. The rib if always cooked till tender but not too soft till it just falls off the bone. Another house special will be the signature tofu. If I guess it correctly, it's normal tofu smashed with other condiments like onions+ carrot + minced meat, then being re-shaped into a cube and deep fried. Sounds like a perfectly simple dish yet tastes awesome. They are served with some fresh cabbage and mayo on the side. The rib and tofu is my ""must-order"" dishes. Other common zhi char dishes are very good too; sambal kangkong, fu rong egg, pai gu wang. The next time you are around Bugis but looking for a non-shopping-mall-food-chain-place, you should definitely try 3838. Highly recommended!"

Their website lists its menu and includes prices, which is extremely rare - well done.Around 11:40am I went there to get an early start on lunch. Ordered the spicy chicken spaghetti meal ($8.90) which included soup and pasta.The soup of the day was cream of mushroom and it was excellent. Thanks for not making some disgusting SoTD flavours like Subway does e.g. cream of broccoli. It also came with a sliver of garlic bread which was also excellent, but small.Finally after 20 minutes (I'm guessing they lost my order) the main came out (see pic). Overall it was good, the pasta was nice, the chicken and diced tomatoes were excellent, but the rest of the sauce was a bit bland, and not spicy.Additionally, no Parmesan cheese, pepper grinder or Tabasco on the table was a bit weird. But overall for less than $9, a hearty meal."

More value for the same price! But the staffs are sometimes not very attentive. Although there are not many customers around, they took quite a while to come to us to take our orders (sadly, this happened more than once).

The food was delicious. I'm normally a guy who needs meat in his meals, but the wife was craving vegetarian. I ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides. The garlic naan  has visible bits of garlic covering it, but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor. I wouldn't have minded a stronger punch of garlic, but I do love garlic. The mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go. I probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with.The uttapam was a pancake-like food which we ordered the onion version of. It's like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice. The sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one. I personally liked the spicy one. The white one reminded me of a cole slaw. We finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing. Not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which I appreciated.You can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign. Thankfully they also had a sink with soap  to wash your hands since the meals are eaten by hand.Overall really good experience and we would come back again"

We tried everything from the spicy ""Podi Dosa"" to the soft idlies and to the foot tall ""Cone dosa"", which was unsurprisingly, shaped like a cone. They all tasted pretty darn good and consistent. The chutneys could've had a little bit of variation. They all tasted pretty much the same which kind of got old pretty fast. The best part about the meal was the glorious filter coffee.

There's a sink to wash your hands cause that's all you're gonna be using to eat with. Just the atmosphere and everything. Oh man. You've got to try the MANGO LASSI! Most I've had in America have been overly sweet but this. this was on point. Yogurt + Mango and the perfect amount of sweetness. So onto the food. We ordered Butter Naan and regular Naan and split several of the dipping dishes between 5 of us. We ordered 5 dishes and boy they creep up on you. I was so full by the end of the meal. To be honest after a while all of them started to taste similar to me - but I have low spicy tolerance and it was probably more of that speaking. I'm terrible at remembering names but there was this one dish that stood out that was green (I believe spinach / pea mixture). Anyway if you figure out which one that is you should try it :) Big hit with our table."

So definitely  avoid trying to go to the loo here.Food wise, this is a South Indian place so you can't go wrong with Dosa - however if you can't tolerate too much spice like me, just let the servers know because I didn't and my dosa came laden with green chillies! The sambar was truly lovely as was the coconut chutney. Not that big fan of the tomato chutney. Loved that you could get second helpings of the sambar and chutneys as well as the subzi for free. The local folks we were with got an Andhra Plate. I can't recall if this particular item was available only on weekends or just Sunday's but gosh, that plate was turbo loaded with food - no dosa include in this however, unfortunately!Would def return as good food at great price and free second helpings"

I sat downstairs and ordered idlis, a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast. For those who do not know what an idling is, the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake, generally 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and made with fermented batter (like masa for tamales) using a mix of soaked rice and daal (lentils).  Medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour. Upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat, cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves, onions, mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves.By lunch time, I was craving the food at Komala Vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section, climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table. In a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls. Another server came by and filled the utensils with different South Indian vegetarian preparations. I was served rice, papadums, sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork, started attacking what was in front of me.  Never having expected to finish all my rice, I was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping.  It is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough. The stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more.I have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it, often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants, Indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called Singapore.My big frustration is that if Komala Vilas in Singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared South Indian food, why can't other similar restaurants outside India, particularly those in the US do so? Even if some copy Komala Vilas' name they fail to replicate its food. If only the original Komala Vilas decides to expand to the San Francisco Bay Area, life could be so wonderful."

Komala Vila is located in the heart of little India. When you enter the restaurant the staff will seat you downstairs or escort you upstairs depending on capacity. Then you'll wash your hands because you won't find utensils here! The dish that kept both of us coming back was the Masala Dosa. The masala dosa is a crispy crepe rolled up and stuffed with potatoes, peas, and delicious spices. It's paired with three different dipping sauces. I have no idea what they were or what they were called but the yellow one is delicious!! If you're in the mood for something sweet order a mango lassi drink.

The food was delicious. I'm normally a guy who needs meat in his meals, but the wife was craving vegetarian. I ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides. The garlic naan  has visible bits of garlic covering it, but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor. I wouldn't have minded a stronger punch of garlic, but I do love garlic. The mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go. I probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with.The uttapam was a pancake-like food which we ordered the onion version of. It's like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice. The sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one. I personally liked the spicy one. The white one reminded me of a cole slaw. We finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing. Not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which I appreciated.You can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign.

So yes, I was not surprised by anything at Komala Vilas. And apparently it is a pretty old restaurant which used to be good. I'm glad to tell you they are holding up pretty well.The food was overall pretty good. We tried everything from the spicy ""Podi Dosa"" to the soft idlies and to the foot tall ""Cone dosa"", which was unsurprisingly, shaped like a cone. They all tasted pretty darn good and consistent. The chutneys could've had a little bit of variation. They all tasted pretty much the same which kind of got old pretty fast. The best part about the meal was the glorious filter coffee. It was bitter... just so darn bitter and sweet - exactly how South Indian coffee should be. It was a perfect way to wrap this breakfast up. Will drop by again when I'm craving some nostalgia."

I sat downstairs and ordered idlis, a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast. For those who do not know what an idling is, the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake, generally 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and made with fermented batter (like masa for tamales) using a mix of soaked rice and daal (lentils).  Medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour. Upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat, cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves, onions, mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves.By lunch time, I was craving the food at Komala Vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section, climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table. In a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls. Another server came by and filled the utensils with different South Indian vegetarian preparations. I was served rice, papadums, sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork, started attacking what was in front of me.  Never having expected to finish all my rice, I was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping.  It is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough. The stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more.I have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it, often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants, Indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called Singapore.My big frustration is that if Komala Vilas in Singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared South Indian food, why can't other similar restaurants outside India, particularly those in the US do so? Even if some copy Komala Vilas' name they fail to replicate its food. If only the original Komala Vilas decides to expand to the San Francisco Bay Area, life could be so wonderful."

Then you'll wash your hands because you won't find utensils here! The dish that kept both of us coming back was the Masala Dosa. The masala dosa is a crispy crepe rolled up and stuffed with potatoes, peas, and delicious spices. It's paired with three different dipping sauces.

One appeared to be yogurt based, another with chili peppers in it, and then another that was similar to curry. The food itself was barebones delicious, and even at around 4pm the restaurant was packed. There were side boxes for to-go samosas that also looked delicious. The menu is hard to understand if you aren't familiar with authentic Indian cuisine, but everything is so good and the pictures provide a lot. We were in and out quickly even though we ended up sitting down, and is a good place to take a quick meal/snack break while wandering around Little India.

A couple of things - South Indian food is meant to eaten with hands mostly.  They have a wash basin to wash your hands. But it would be great to keep it a bit more cleaner.   Also they take only cash. If you don't have cash, there is an ATM at a store ( a few feet nearby).

I had lunch with my sis and mum today. I ordered an Indian rice meal while the other 2 had dosas. Mine arrived first and both of them took a bite to try the food which was all they did. When I asked for an extra helping of the vegetable curry (which is the norm), I was told due to our sharing my food I was not eligible to get more food. The person attending to me was a manager so I explained that they had ordered their food and were just waiting. He served me the curry without issues. However, when I asked a waiter he absolutely refused to serve me until I raised my voice. I am DISGUSTED and SHOCKED. I have been a loyal customer since I was a child and go to the restaurant at least once a month. I even know some of the servers by face and name.

You get unlimited rice and curry for $7.20.  Yes, they have raised the price a couple bucks since we first came but it's totally worth it.  Everyone in the restaurant is using their hands and speaking in Tamil or other Indian dialects.  We get plenty of strange looks when we show up.

With the flavours & combinations, you can't really go wrong. Had the beef bowl & foie. Like I said with the flavours & quality of ingredients, you can't really go wrong. I was happy with the Foie, big portion, cooked well and packed with flavour. The beef was tasty but when you order it with the foie, they GIVE SO LITTLE!!! Which didn't make sense! Because if I paid more it should be a add-on not a way to balance the portions? The rice was a little dry. The batch I had was not cooked well in my opinion but luckily it had all the other stuff to make it decent. I didn't like the Ginger Lemonade. For the size of the glass (and price!), it should really be done better. It lacked balance and the ginger was so overpowering that I felt like I ordered a spicy ginger drink! I could hardly taste the lemonade. I had to add water & squeeze the lemon wedge to balance the flavour. Menu options sounded good. I'd come back to try the other dishes."

Surprisingly it wasn't all that bad. the carbonara toppoki was not overly creamy nor greasy but i don't recommend it for one person.

Logically it was weird but taste wise, it was perfect! And if you want to know how the pizza is made, do watch the in store video that's playing; every step of the process is explained in detailed.

I'd recommend trying one of the other options nearby.Came here on a Sunday evening, and was seated quite quickly with no wait. However, their ordering system was quite overly complicated. Rather than just simply ordering with one of the wait staff, the ordering experience involved having to sign up on my device for an account and inputting my credit card details online to pay for my food in advance. Not a huge inconvenience, but since I had slow data speeds in the shop, it didn't help my experience.I went for the 12'' Bulgogi Pizza ($28 after fees), which looked quite promising on the menu. It was definitely a bit pricey for a meal for one. After about a 15 minute wait, it finally came out, and much to my dismay, seemed to be so sparse in Bulgogi that I was wondering if I had accidentally ordered the vegetarian option by mistake. Eating it, I was very quickly overpowered with the taste of onion, which was really all it tasted like--the bulgogi had very little flavor. I'd recommend going with some of the other pizzas on their menu, personally.I don't think I'll be coming back here, given that there are plenty of other options that are more affordable in the area, with a more standard and less frustrating service experience."

It's always crowded to the brim (at least on all of my visits) so reservation is recommended.  And no, this is not your upscale, pretty, zen kaiseiki fine dining kind of place, it's more like a hole-in-the-wall establishment. At times, their tables spilled over to the ""roadside"" - the corridor inside the very run-down looking mall.  Understandably, you might be a bit skeptical but the sheer volume of native Japanese seems to be testimonial of its authenticity.  And the moment you sat down, take a sip of the sake and dig into that bowlful of octopus tentacles full of umami goodness you get teleported to the streets of Japan.  Menu seems constantly updated and items come in small plates for sharing.  Just pick whatever looks good or just pick everything, the good thing about small plates is that you can have a good selection.  On my first visit when my friend took me there, he told me about the ""rule"" that to get a seat you need to order alcohol.  Understandably that causes some distress in people who don't drink but to be fair it is an izakaya which is literally a place for drinks so make some alcoholic friends!"

Sometimes the rice feels powdery & a bit dry but that was probably because of the weather. The key to a great Biryani is that the meat & rice needs to be slow cooked in traditional spices for it to be at it's juiciest best. That is exactly how the owner approaches this complicated & subtle dish.This is as authentic as it gets & it's NOT that brown goop they serve with yellow rice at most places which even the owner at Bismillah agrees is an abomination! Biryani was the dish of Mughal emperors & soldiers & signified feasting in a royal manner. It was considered a complete meal in itself & it is with that respect for tradition & flavour that the owner/chef Arif bhai cooks it. It is his love for crafting this complex dish that adds to the old school charm of this place in addition to the brilliant food.

Yes, din tai fung doesn't disappoint. But as I develop taste for Asian food, living in Singapore I get greedy and crave for something beyond. So while on the look out for good dim sum that hasn't been all fancied-up by us expats, came across quite a few posts on this place. Then our office move happened and found myself working only ~10 minutes walk away from here. So it finally happened. Food was great. My Chinese friend approved its authenticity and way above-par taste (and even over-ate -- this is someone who DOES NOT over-eat.) * Egg tarts (4/5) were really good. Very fluffy & light with crisp crust on the outside. *Siew Mai's (3/5) were okay. I definitely had better ones before. Didn't particularly find them flavorful. * Har gao (4/5) -- yes! The shrimp meats were thick & tangy. Enough said. * Spinach & Prawn dumplings(3.5/5) also had good shrimp meat inside & had stickiness and juice that went well together. But would've liked it better if there was a bit less skin of the dumpling. * Chee-chong fun with Charsiew (3.5/5) was decent as well. Now that I think about it, perhaps I don't like the dumpling skin-like things too much in general. * Carrot cake, I can't say much about because I am not a fan to begin with. So will refrain from commenting. * Spicy sauce chicken claws (a.k.a. chicken feet) (4.5/5) was a wow! I've heard many things about how it has lots of collagen and all & tried several times, but one bite was enough for each of those. But this time, it was different. The sauce was just the right spiciness with really delicious flavor. Best chicken feet I've had so far. I will definitely order this again. * Steamed spare ribs with black bean sauce (4.5/5) was another win. Well-steamed to the right level of tanginess, just the right amount of flavor that brings out the taste of the rib, while not being bland. Loved it. * Golden ""Bo Lo"" Char Siew Butter Buns (4/5) were very tasty. Crips on the outside, filled with rich char siew fillings on the inside. But to me, it was a bit too saucy. Still good, but a bit more meat and less sauce would've hit the golden balance. * Double-boiled egg white with fresh milk and almond juice (2.5/5) was okay. Too much almond taste for a double-boiled egg. * Golden Egg Yolk Lava Buns (3.5/5) -- supposedly the most popular dish here -- didn't impress me too much. Expected the inside to be a bit more rich gooey liquid fullness but didn't really happen. The mixture didn't seem to be very well mixed. Still decent.  I will be trying Charsiew Baos and some porridge the next time I go. Service is not bad, but the food doesn't come out too fast either. (Having heard of the long queue, I went pretty early-- a bit before noon -- but the food still came out rather slow and came in a staggered manner, not in any particular oder. Perhaps my personal preference but I like my dimsums to just come all at once for me to gawk at the variety and steaminess all together.) But let's just think that that's how fresh the dimsums are? as they are made to order? The ambiance is not somewhere you'd just walk by and be invited to go in. But I think it's part of the authentic experience. So I loved it and would definitely be bringing my friends here."

I expect you're really expecting some sort of verdict on the famed liushabaos (those salted egg yolk custard lava buns) and those were pretty disappointing. it was very oily, with much of the fat having separated from the paste, and it didn't really ooze (not even with a less-than-gently squeeze). flavor-wise, I think it could have done with a bit more salt.the menu is small, but it's cheap, and it's rather like those eateries you get in old-town malaysia or hong kong.

When i arrived it was just as people commented 'small, tiny place'. Did wait awhile to find a seat and had to call the waitress a few times to get the order chit. Aside from these, the food was not bad. I decided to try the summer milk tea which sounded yummy, indeed it was. However i thought that it was quite expensive $3 for a cup of tea, it was akin to buying a cup of Koi bubble tea with pearls. Next we tried the highly acclaimed items such as the siew mai, custard bun, king prawn dumpling and hong kong style pan fried chee chiong fun (rice roll). The siew mai was really good with actual crab roe on top of it and it was flavourful, juicy and succulent. The custard bun was really smooth and creamy and went well with the texture of the fluffy bun.The dumpling was a giveaway as for that price, the amount of filling given was really worth it. The succulent skin was so thin yet maintained a bouncy and chewy feel and alot of filling was wrapped into that skin, it was as if it was going to burst anytime. Next came the hong kong style chee chiong fun and it was interesting i must say. Have never tried anything like it, crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, yummy. The service there however was not really good, they seemed to favour westerners more than us. Overall a good experience with some misses."

Nothing to shout about, I've had far better dim sum. They forgot our order of the you tiao chang fen or there was some mix-up. It was so busy and chaotic that we didn't bother to ask them.The real highlights of the meal were the drinks. Iced milk tea - hot tea served in a plastic cup in a bowl of ice cubes so the tea isn't diluted when the ice melts. Pretty novel idea and the tea is close to what you get at cha chan ting's in HK.

The steamed carrot cake was pleasantly surprising - bits of scallops and waxed sausage (lup cheong) mixed in an almost coarse pudding - and the XO sauce adds a little extra zing.The rest of the food passes by in a haze, and we harry the auntie for more, but you'll remember to order the Zhar Leong (cheong fun with you tiao), and have some ice summer milk tea - they cool the drink by placing the cup in a bowl of ice, so it gets cooled without being diluted. Old School much.And of course, you'll finish your meal with some Golden Egg Yolk Lava Buns. Everyone does, as long as they still have some in stock. You might call it Liu Sha Bao, but here at Victor's, everything's got a cooler name.A couple of months ago, we heard about a change in the family situation, and the food quality may have changed, but subsequent visits don't show noticeable differences. Give it a go, it don't cost much any way."

It is a really narrow shop though, so be prepared to sit a little too close for comfort next to a stranger from the next table. To order, you tick your selected dishes on an order slip and hand in to a waitress. The waitresses, however, are extremely slow at attending to customers. It usually takes ages just to get their attention. Alas, they do serve a few recommendable dishes, the best being Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun aka custard pau. The custard paus are unbeatable; I have not tasted any better. The piping hot custard filling oozes out the moment you break open the skin. The sweetness of the custard and the saltiness of the preserved egg yolk make a perfect marriage. Another good dish is the Siew Mai - a dim sum classic. Their version was tasty, had a strong porky taste and had a great texture to it."

The Chinese have been getting up at noon and peeling wax paper off char siew buns for ages, and if you're sick of heavy and extravagant Western fare, but need a heart-warming Chinese entreé to start your day that won't hurt your wallet, you're at the right place.Start off by getting a basket of Victor's signature Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun ($3.50 for 3), and be careful when you split it the middle to let steam out, because the glorious golden filling might just ooze out (and make a mess!). When it's cool enough to eat, savour the sweet-salty and gooey salted egg yolk-based custard. While we're still talking buns, a basket of Milky Custard Buns ($3.50 for 3) is sure to delight both pau & dessert fans with its decadently smooth custard interior and melt-in-your-mouth silky skin.And what's Yum Cha without har gow ($3.50 for 4)? Bite into one of these steamed prawn dumplings and be surprised by the crunch - wrapped in a crystalline, semi-see-through skin are three whole shrimps and delicious pork filling. Another dumpling that is a must-have is their Tasty Queen Size Siew Mai ($3.50 for 4). Larger than your average siew mai, these bundles of joy are sure to put a smile on your face with delight, though they might be too overpowering with umami and a little bit too salty.Order a cup of Hong Kong Summer Ice Tea ($2.00) to accompany the baskets of buns and dumplings, and be impressed by their genius - the tea is served in a cup that is placed in a bowl of ice, so you don't have to worry about your tea getting too mellow with dilution"

I would say it's ok but I honestly did not find it too special and the price is not that cheap if you consider how crammed the place is and the general comfort level.  So people told me their egg yolk bun (liu sha bao) is the signature dish but I think you find similar quality ones in any of the imperial treasures or crystal jade dim sum restaurants.  I also don't think some of the items are that fresh, pretty sure it's not freshly made at the site because it's a bit too hard (esp. the char siu puff pastry).  One thing I like is their HK style milk tea which is quite authentic.  As a person with over 30 years of dim sum eating experience, I would say this is definitely not the most authentic dim sum in Singapore, there are better places at reasonable prices.  It's also not a place where you can hang out and chit chat with your friend over tea, which is what the whole yum cha experience should be about."

Headed down to Victor's Kitchen for their liu sha bao since I was nursing a serious craving for them. Well, everyone else had the same brunch idea so even though we came down at 2+pm, it was packed and the queue was long. We queued for about 15 minutes before it was our turn. Note of caution: No one is going to serve you at the front of the restaurant, so head on straight to an empty table when you sight one. The place was completely packed, and at Victor's, that means Hong Kong-style claustrophobia. Be prepared to wriggle your way in and out of the restaurant (if you can call it that) because of the ultra dense seating arrangement. After a rather unpleasantly long wait for the food, cheong fun was served. It was one of the highlights of the meal. Another winner was the steamed carrot cake that was served pudding style. I enjoyed it, but I wish it came with more sauce. Some other dishes that came were disappointing. The siew mai tasted stale, and the ha gao was over steamed. The steam pork ribs and fried toufu skin with prawns were unmemorable. Fortunately, the liu sha bao was decent and satisfied my craving. Best eaten the moment it reaches your table, this bun is filled with a sugary and salty custard that flows out the moment you sink your teeth into it. The Hong Kong iced milk tea is good too.Not the best place for dim sum, but if you want a true Hong Kong-style dim sum dining experience, head here."

Evidently, pretty much everyone else had the same bright idea. Victor's Kitchen opens at 1030am, and by the time we got there, it was packed to the brim with couples and families.Food: The glutinous rice with chicken and sausage was excellent. And this is coming from someone who's not a big fan of carbs. Really liked the zhar leung (i.e. fried doughstick in rice roll), was pretty much the closest we've had to Hong Kong fare. The har gau and siew mai were so-so, not exceptional. The carrot cake with XO sauce was unusual but not exceptional, and the custard buns were just so-so. The mango pomelo sago's pretty good. The iced milk tea though, was absolutely kickass. Victor's Kitchen is the ONLY place which serves iced milk tea identical to the famous stocking iced milk tea in Hong Kong's Fa Yuen Street.Ambience: For a relatively ghetto hole in the wall dim sum joint, it's acceptable. Service: Pretty decent, they try to do their best given the crowds. And I love being surrounded by authentic Cantonese speaking wait staff.

We used to talk about having Aroy Dee for meal everytime when we pass by Middle Road especially when this Kitchen is just located next to LE Cafe. We all heard good claims about the kitchen and perhaps why it was there for such a long time.Interior is rather modern with semi open concept kitchen. Furnishing are made up of metal chairs and wooden table with tiles flooring. They also include a mounted television for diners to watch and enjoy their meal.Thai Coconut - $4.90Clear Tom Yam Seafood Soup was appetizing and even though we forgot to instruct the server to make it less spicy, I would say that spiciness was mild and the soup really whet my appetite for more. Ingredients include fish slices, tomato, lemon grass, coriander and Sotong, which were nothing out of the normal soup we had.Tom Yum SoupPineapple fried rice portion was generous and good for sharing. Tasted mediocre with chicken floss, raisins, eggs and mixed vegetables. A bit disappointing!Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken Floss - $6.50The pandan chicken leaves were fried to crisp and required some efforts to unwrapped before we can get hold of the meat. The turmeric used was a tad too much and meat was rather soft. Overall, tasted like chicken satay to me. Dip them into the sweet and sour chilli sauce and enjoy it.Pandan Chicken - $10Phad Thai, which is always one of my favourite under the Thai Cuisine Menu was really to my liking as we prefer to have a dryer version than this. However, in terms of taste, it was still alright with the fragrant of peanuts and sweet savoury sauce coated on the noodle.Phad Thai - $6.50Thai Fried Fish was something I always wish to order but always get turned off by its expensive pricing. Due to promotion, it cost $19.90 instead of $28. Fried Garoupa was well presented with vegetables as sides sprinkled with few stalks of coriander and soaked mildly in their three taste sauce. The sauce was not too bad with sweetness, saltiness and a little sourish.Garoupa with Special Three Taste Sauce - $19.90Last but not least the papaya Salad with salty crab. There was a promotion to this item at $9 instead of $15. I'm kind of fool by the menu as I thought that it was salted egg crab. This appetiser wasnt too pleasing to us, firstly it was served when we almost finished our meal and secondly, the papaya salad was too spicy for us. In the end, we left almost 90% of the food on table.Thai Papaya Salad with Salty Crab - $9The good thing about the eating place is good for supper goers as it opens till as early as 6am in the morning. If you want to have pocket friendly food that comes with generous portion, this can be one of your choices. However, if you are particular about taste of Thai food then you have to be selective of what you are ordering in the menu. Personally, I have expected their standard items like Pineapple Fried Rice and Phad Thai to be better. Therefore, it is less likely I will be back for other items on the menu.Do note  that payment terms are only Cash or NETS."

I have to give kudos to the ladies who served our table because she was definitely accommodating to our requests - like having our army stew 'super, duper, extra spicy'. They were extremely attentive and I never had to ask for a refill of my iced barley tea, which is definitely a plus point for me because their cups are rather tiny, and I would hate being a bother who keeps asking for a refill. We got a Signature Combo where for 2 pax, you get one appetizer, one signature dish and one dessert from a selection on their menu. We were quite torn between having the Spicy Rice Cakes or the Pancake/Kimchi Pancake, but went for the first in the end - which we kinda regretted because the fish wasn't as awesome as we imagined it to be. This was I guess the let downer in the entire experience. I definitely loved the Army Stew - we got the one with assorted meat, which was really super yummy! I love that it's served to the table still 'raw' so it's cooked table top on a gas stove which is really good for me and the partner because I like my noodles chewy while he likes it soft - it was the best of both worlds. The meet assortment was rather interesting because they had luncheon meat and sausages as well. It was the first time we were trying this dish, and we can't wait to go to Korea to try the real thing on a cold winter day some time soon! We had Patbingsoo for the dessert - nothing fancy though I would have preferred that it be yoghurt rather than ice cream (substituted because I think they ran out of yoghurt for the day already) - which I guess contributed to the lack the the extra star as well because the ice cream doesn't really go with the dessert as a whole. I would definitely come here to eat again, but I'll be ordering different appetizers next time around. Oh, speaking about appetizers - the tofu with spicy-ish sesame sauce in the 6 little bowls that they give you before your meal is quite awesome!"

This place used to have snaking long lines for its stews, but now is much less popular, and I can unfortunately see why. I came here after seeing the long lines at Yoogane, thinking that Korean food can't exactly be bad right? I even ordered spicy kimchi stew ($12.90) because that's the basic Korean food that's literally impossible to get wrong right? Sadly no. It was a little too salty and tasted of MSG, not the usual pork stew or even tofu taste. The tofu was tough. It didn't even come with white rice. My friend ordered the set with jjajiangrice & dumplings. The dumplings tasted alright but overall average. The appetizers served with the meal were also very tiny plates & subpar. If you're looking for authentic Korean food, don't bother! You can get a good meal for less at so many other places, even the food court is better."

Ordered their second combo set for $48.90 suitable for 2 pax but several of the items were pretty bad (EXCEPT their kimchi chigae and grilled salmon!). The beef bibimbap was really dry and tasteless, the beef in it was very dry as well, it was burnt even before we started stirring. Took 2 spoons of the bimbap and that was it. In addition, their 4 side dishes was also dry and somewhat stale, they have pre-prepared them, left it in the open before serving us (oh god). The kimchi chigae was a real redemption though! It was so nice. Tangy and sour, I'm sure they cooked it with real homemade kimchi. Appreciate that. It's quite additive btw. Grilled salmon was a good too. Hygiene wise the place was ok but I've got this impression it isn't clean either. The plates/spoons were slightly dirty, u can see some remnants still attached to them even after washing.I had to use the wet tissue to clean them before dining. Service wise, it was relatively good, staffs were friendly and smiley :) Maybe this restaurant is good for their army stew (as I see many people having that), I've yet tried it so can't comment.

I've tried the Pad Thai here and the Pineapple Rice, and both are so worthy of coming back for more, especially for this price. In Thai Gold, you could easily get a hearty genuine thai meal for less than $8. My serving of Pineapple Rice cost no more than $5, and was filling enough for one. The rice was very well oiled and cooked, strategically filled with pineapple and topped with pork floss and cashew nuts. Very tasty, very fragrant. My counterpart today had the rice with fried garlic chicken, which was surprisingly amazing, and literally blew my mind with how crisp it was, and how rich the garlic taste was. The tenderness was also something I hadn't expected from a shop that serves out food as cheap and quick as this. One dampener for me is the thai iced tea, which looked good with its layers, but wasn't very 'together', even if it was very sweet and thick. In summary: great great value, good genuine thai food.

Perhaps I'll sit further inside, away from the kitchen the next time."

The quesadillas were good, even though the fillings were distributed a little unevenly. Chicken wings were good too, with a very good crunch to them, but just slightly over-salty. For mains, we had the laksa, braised beef shin, chicken parmigiana and honey berry ribs. The laksa was surprisingly the best dish of the lot, although 12.90 for laksa is rather expensive. The parmigiana was tasty, but don't order it if you don't like your food deep fried. Some of the ends were almost charred. Almost. The beef shin was tagged to be the best dish of the lot, but unfortunately it was pretty ordinary,like stir fried beef at a zhichar stall. The honey Berry ribs were alright, although I couldn't taste the honey or Berry in the sauce. The ribs themselves were fall-odf-the-bone tender, but slightly underseasoned. Now all the food was served with impeccable timing. The appetisers were served first, and once they were done, all the mains came together..  Except the ribs. Unfortunately the waiter forgot to key in my order, and the ribs only arrived 15 minutes after everyone else had finished their mains. The waiter was of course apologetic,and I found it hard to lose my cool when scripture was hanging on the wall right in front of me. Overall, the food was good but somehow just missed the mark by a little bit. If it weren't for the forgotten order, I'd have given it 5 stars."

Came here after attending a visual art exhibition at Singapore Arts Museum (walkable distance) and since there were quite a number of space, we managed to get seated on a comfy sofa like chair. The waiter approached us checking whether we would want some iced water while we decide on our orders. It was a nice professional gesture from their end. After browsing through a one double sided menu, I decided to order the following.1) Wanted to order root beer but it was out of stock. Same with my friends' orders of Ginger beer.2) Decided to order Snapple's pink lemonade instead.3) Chilli crab pasta sounded good at that moment so decided to order that. They ran out of Fettuccine so I had to change the pasta to spaghetti instead. Verdict: pasta was warm when it was served, chewy and tender in terms of texture. The  deep fried soft shell crab were both delicious and crunchy (managed to get the ones with eggs) and the Crossings' own chilli crab claw meat sauce were flavorful and hint of spicy made the dish special. (definitely recommended)4) My friend ordered fish and chips. The fish batter was pretty good and the portion of the fish fillet was bigger than expected too. 5) Hazelnut molten cake with ice cream. The dish was warm when it arrived to our table. The chocolate was a little bitter but the cake was moist and soft. Combined with the vanilla ice cream, it is one of best lava cake in Singapore. Overall, price wise it was quite affordable and considering that profits will be directed to charities made this place a gem. The service was excellent too as they checked on the customers' needs quickly when customers raised their hands. As my friends and I left for this place, we were also greeted with a thanks. Will be back soon for more yummy goodies :)"

As a social enterprise, I am very impressed with the level of service delivered by servers who are challenged in different special ways. They are professional and extremely polite. The greatest I derive from dining at this place is the fact that not only do I get good food and good service, all profits are donated to charity! So as I enjoy a good meal, I am also able to contribute to the society. What more can I ask?There are many places that use the term social enterprise very loosely and patrons suffer either from high price (in the name of social cause and benefit) or bad food/service and we are expected to be understanding because the special needs or at-risk individuals are involved. That should not be the case. Quality and experience should not be compromised for the sake of social good. I fully support Crossings because they have created an environment that bring out the best in all the staff, regardless of their special needs and patrons are always well taken care of. Respect!"

As a Lasalle student, this is an ideal place for a quick bite. Prices are moderate though can be lower for certain stalls.As the place recently finished renovations, the premises looks cleaner and more updated. Welcome to 2015, Broadway. The current problem with the place is the insufficient quantity of halal makan stalls. The only one that is qualified as halal is Indian * Pakistan Cuisine. The stall is run by an Indian man with, whom I believe is his mother, in the kitchen. I ordered the Butter Chicken with Naan, costing $7.50. There was an option to take Naan, but I wasn't sure if it was chargeable or complimentary. The food comes as 1 plate of naan and 1 boat of butter curry with the chicken inside it. The naan tasted fresh and excellent as it is cooked and prepared from dough on the spot. The butter curry tastes strong and feels rather sweet as well, though this is expected of butter. The chicken cutlets which are soaked in the curry are also savory and taste delicious. I decided to go for a mini taco kinda thing and wrapped pieces of naan with curry and chicken. Simply excellent. With that said, the price is a little steep but is justified by the taste and cost of ingredients. Broadway has finally upped its game but holds potential in the future by possibly adding more halal food.Definitely a place to go for now as a regular makan place, assuming you're not Muslim."

It was located near Bras Basah MRT Station (CC2). As it was a week day night, the restaurant was not crowded and we were showed to a private room for our dinner. The room was big with at least 4 tables. It was full glass window where one can have a good view of outside. As Melvin was a regular customer, he had done some  consulting with the chef about the menu. He decided on what was fresh and what was the chef's best dishes.We started the meal with Roasted Suckling Pig. Surprisingly it was served with the sweet sauce underneath. The skin was crispy and fatty part was simply melted in the mouth.Next we had double boiled soup. Inside the soup, there was shark's fin, dried scallop, whelk, ginseng, chicken,and chinese ham. The soup was very flavourful.For the fish dish, we had Baked fish with Cream Sauce. It was served with asparagus. The fish was simply melted in the mouth. Everyone agreed that it was the best dish of this meal.Next we had Stir Fried Scallop and Shimeji Mushroom with XO sauce. Tasted slightly spicy, the scallop was quite juicy.This was followed by the Crispy Roasted Chicken. It was served topped with crispy curry leaves, almond slices, sliced chilli, and savoury crispy bites. I like the savoury crispy bites which added another layer of taste to the roasted chicken.For the vegetable dish, we had Braised Abalone with seasonal vegetables. It was served with shiitake mushroom and spinach. The abalone was well flavoured here.For the carbohydrates, we had Lotus Leaf Rice. The glutinous rice flavoured with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, and chinese ham. The rice was not too mushy.Lastly for dessert, we had Hashima. It was served hot, with longan, red date, ginseng, and lotus seed. It did not taste too sweet. The lotus seed was well cooked and soft to bite. Hashima is made from the dried fatty tissue found near the fallopian tubes of true frogs. The version here was simply melted in the mouth.Overall the food was very good. Although I did not get to see the actual bill, but it was about $100 per person for this meal. Sounded expensive but it was expected considering the expensive items ordered. The staffs were friendly. Plates were replaced for every dish. The manager and even the chef also came over to check on our table. Guess Melvin was such a VIP here."

When I was there, bottles started at $30 (!!!) and that made me a very happy customer. Also, despite the price tag, they were very decent bottles.The food here was quite good, the only thing I have to say is that French food is on the heavy side. The bone marrow was super generous - it came with 3 giant bones which you can scrape out deliciously onto toasted bread. The pork rilette was also yummy and went well with the pickled cornichons provided on the side. The mains are well priced as well, and while I liked my Kurobuta t-bone, it all became quite heavy. I was not a fan of their desserts though.I think this place would do great as a place for a drink and a bite! I will probably come back for the very reasonably priced drinks."

Upon being seated, we were informed of a long list of items that were no longer available due to missing ingredients. Our server was clueless about the menu and how items were prepared when we inquired. After ordering, someone came over to tell us that they were out of heirloom tomatoes so they needed to modify the dish we ordered for regular tomatoes. I ordered an iced latte. They forgot to bring sugar or sweetners so after requesting it and waiting far too long with no action, I went to the bar and picked some up. After tasting it, the latte was way too strong and I requested a hot latte instead. The server asked several questions asking if it could be modified, I responded no, she finally took it away. Awhile later she arrived with the replacement, right before I drank from it, she came and took it away saying it was hot chocolate (a mistake). She later returned with what looked like the same drink (now barely hot) and I could finally consume my mediocre coffee. Then the food came out, I ordered the croque monsieur with fried eggs. It barely resembled any croque monsieur I've ever had. It was also extremely bland. I had to add salt and pepper to give it some flavor. We were then ignored forever, ran out of water and only got a refill when we asked for it. To make matters worse, a few hours later, as I prepared to head out for the evening, I got a horrible stomachache. My boyfriend had to run out to get me medicine and we spent the rest of our first day in Singapore in bed. This restaurant not only ruined our meal, but also our first of only three days in the city. With so many great places to eat in Singapore, DON'T GO HERE AND REGRET IT LIKE US!"

The original reason we came to Rex was supposed to be for its chicken rice. This however was disappointing to half the people eating it's supposed to be the top 10 chicken rice. The chicken was good tasting but fairly dry. The rice can be a little more fragrant and the chili more viscous as it is a little dilute and thin.

Chicken soft bone was not soft at all, overly fried and hard. Gyozas were ok only, as were the skewers. On hindsight I should have just eaten 4 croquettes instead.

Anyway, the menu has a pretty good offering of dishes, including escargot in garlic butter. The pork tonkatsu was moist but a little fatty for my liking. The panko crust was delicate and didn't leave you that oily mouth feel. The Tonteki pork steak was good too and pan-fried perfectly. The fatty parts had a nice char and the meat was tender and juicy. Usually, the Tonteki comes smothered in their ""Original Tonkatsu Sauce"" which I'm glad I asked for on the side because although it was tasty in a Worcestershire sauce kinda way, it would have overwhelmed the pork steak. Plenty of beer and wine selection to choose from. Didn't have room for dessert, but there is a large offering of it if you are so inclined to indulge in.

Tasty and fills me up - it comes with fries and a bed of bean sprouts. Kinda reminds me of a glorified pepper lunch. It was served in an interesting manner too - The waiter will pour some sort of liquid on your egg and burger, and it would light up for awhile before she pours another liquid on top of it to put the fire out.After serving your meal, your waiter will give you a key which you will then take to the cashier to pay your bill and ""check out"" of this lovely B&B. cute eh?"

Last year, while looking for places to eat on a Friday night at Liang Court, I stumbled across this strange French cottage-looking restaurant with tons of ladies waiting outside. Couldn't put two together and moved on. Earlier this year, after moving to my new workplace at Suntec, a friend suggested we have lunch at Ma Maison at Bugis Junction. When I walked in (once again, there was a line for lunch), everything clicked!I've only had the Ma Maison set meals with grilled steak, hamburg steak and tonkatsu because someone told they're really good at the hamburg. Why order anything else if a restaurant is great with it's grill right? All of those dishes have been fantastic, with the hamburg steak taking the cake no matter what sauce I've had it with. Plus if you're feeling thirsty, they have a good range of beers by the bottle and some very appetizing tarts that I've *yet* to try.What really rocks my boat however is the service. For Singapore standards, the Bugis outlet has some of the best service I've experienced in this country. From the usual embarrassing welcome you get at Japanese restaurants to accommodating substitutions, explaining sauces and keeping my water glass filled, the staff here get top marks. It's one of the few times I find myself saying, ""boy do the Japanese know how to train their service staff right"" because they all look happy and serve professionally. I do notice that the Japanese managers pay more attention to Japanese customers, but hey I would too if I was working in a foreign country and the ""less attentive"" level already exceeds most competitors. However, I would point out that service at the Parco Millenia restaurant is not great and borders on rude on occasion because, well you guessed it, there are no Japanese managers on site and the outlet seems severely understaffed. One can't have everything so I suggest sticking to Bugis Junction. Lastly, come early or past 1pm during lunchtime to avoid lining up for long. Forget dinner on Mondays (ladies happy hour) or Fridays if you're starving and don't want to wait."

The lighting's a little dim, but it adds to the cosy atmosphere of the restaurant. I had the Gratin with Prawns and Scallops ($13.80), which was pretty good, but they were rather miserly with the actual prawns and scallops - there were only two pieces of each in the large bowl. My friend had the Fresh Greens salad ($6.90) with Japanese dressing - I wasn't too impressed with that. We ended the meal with a Strawberry Tart ($8.80) - the most popular out of at least five different flavours of tarts - and it was not bad. However, the tart base was almost like a very dry cake which I feel did not complement the texture of the strawberries.Ma Maison is known for their sincere approach to food, and it shows through their simple yet delicious dishes.

Followed these up with Camembert Cheese Fritters that were also really yummy, although I would have preferred a different sauce, the one we had oddly resembled Thai sweet chilli.The Beef Stroganoff served with Buttered rice and omelette was a bit disappointing despite my love of Japanese rice. The omelette threw me off a bit and overall the meal could do without.The desserts were the real treat here.

And, based on the recommendations, it came down to Chikuyotei vs. Mikuni.I decided to give Chikuyotei a try and it didn't disappoint me. Even though Chikuyotei is specialized in Edo style unagi but also has Mikawa style of Unagi (Histumabashi). My wife had Edo style and I had Mikawa style. The former one is steam first then grill with light sauce, while the later one is grill with smokey texture and taste. I can't comment on Mikuni unagi yet, however, Chikuyotei's unagi is as authentic as you can get. And  comparing with Yanagawa unagi (which it was my all time favorite), Chikuyotei's Hitsumabashi is on par with Yanagawa unagi. Highly recommend if you are crazy about unagi. Mikawa style unagi costs $80 for a lunch set and Edo style unagi starting price is $40 for a lunch set, both are 200g of unagi."

Got the least expensive fixed price lunch. Was there the first day it opened after the renovation. Minimalistic decor so not sure what they renovated. Not very crowded. They sat me at the counter since I was dining alone. Strangely they have wait service at the counter. First course was flounder (3 thin slices) with salt and truffle oil. Two bites of peeled asparagus and a small piece of tomato. The flounder was heaven on earth! I could have eaten 10 more servings of that!! The second course was a salad. Very refreshing with flower petals, different lettuces, and a few other veggies. Next was the tempura. This was the best mushroom I ever had in my life, plus two pieces of fresh shrimp/prawns, and a pepper (which was good and crispy but I didn't eat).Next was a crab meatball in clear soup. The snow crab ball had a consistency that did not appeal to me so I didn't eat it after tasting it. But the smell and taste of the clear broth was incredible and I devoured every last drop and all the green floating in it.  This was another course I could have made a meal out of by ordering 10 of them!! The Tuna on rice ruined me forever. The tuna melted in my mouth. The rice was delicious that I ate the whole bowl. I asked the sushi chef the secret. He said the secret is red vinegar not white. He also said everything is imported, salt , sugar, rice, etc. I chatted with my sushi chef. He shared with me that the knives are sharpened every day and he showed me his name in Chinese on his knife. I watch him ""garnish"" a dish with the most delicate small flowers; he explained that they can also be put in soy sauce to add flavor.Service was ok. Some dishes came out too fast, I got my first dish before my drink, I was asked if I needed anything else and informed they were closing for lunch before my dessert came, and I had to ask for the check."

Both the chicken dishes were quite good with the chicken being quite tender and tasty. The fish dish which used sea bass was a little on the fishy side for me. The fries were perfectly prepared and pretty tasty too. I also snacked on one of Brotzeit' famous pretzels which was served warm and darn tasty as well.

The fans keep it a pretty nice temperature. Only problem, your food cools quicker. I got the jagerschnitzel which was good. Different then I expected but still good. I was expecting it to still have all the breading with the mushroom sauce. It wasn't really breaded. The mash potatoes reminded me of my Oma's so that was great. I enjoyed eating here.

How wrong can you go with bratwurst and sausages? Besides the beer options, there are wine and mocktail and other non-alcoholic drinks. If you are a light drinker or not that into beer, the mixed beer option is good. I like the Russ'n which is Weissbier mixed with lemonade.

Fried Rice: Didn't try it, however everyone else gobbled it up!Shrimp paste wrapped in fried bean curd skin: Crispy outside, steamy inside! Black Crab Chili Buns: My goodness, I crave these little guys! They're absolutely stunning and in a way they look exciting. They look like pure black buns in a muffin/cupcake cup. When you bite into it, you get this sweet flavor from the bun with a hint of spiciness from the stringy crab. It was silky smooth, and delicious. This is their signature dish, and would recommend everyone trying it. I even tried to find online recipes, however I cannot! Mango pudding: Delicious, it was almost like a mango cream/milk jello, with mango bits inside of it. It was sweet, cool, and refreshing.Service: Very quick, most of the folks at my table were not familiar with the dishes and they came by to explain to them. I also asked for serving spoons, and they promptly gave them to us as well. These guys are excellent and super attentive.Come to this restaurant, you won't regret it!"

My research pointed me towards Jumbos, No Signboard and Long Beach. A few others popped up here and there, including Red House. I didn't think much of this one, but when the day I decided to venture out to get my chilli crab fix turned out to be a stormy day filled with rainstorms, I had to choose the easiest to get to. Red House was a mere two blocks from my hotel so that was an easy choice.At 1:30PM, the restaurant was still filled with families, tourists and businessmen having lunch. Dim sum was apparently still available as most of the tables were eating that. I noticed one table next to me with the crab - and only two people. That made me feel a little bit better, as I wouldn't be the only one making a mess of myself during lunch. Chilli crab, to say the least, can get a bit messy.I ordered the smallest crab available, which was still over 2 lbs. An order of mandou was standard as well. The staff brought out everything I would need to conquer my crab - claws, crackers, water with lemon, wet naps and a bib. When it came, I knew there was NO WAY I was going to finish it. It was HUGE. And then I had a taste of that slightly spicy, very sweet tomato sauce and had to sigh. It was easily the best taste of my entire trip. I did not intend on finishing it - I swear. But before I knew it, the entire crab was gone. The staff was surprised, I could tell. They were watching me eat through the entire meal, which was fine as my water bowl and teapot was constantly replenished. This meal was not cheap - my crab alone was $60 USD. But so, so worth it. It was the perfect meal to end a 11 day foodie adventure."

The service is a bit gruff and reminds me of Chinatown restaurants in ny. Which is fine if the food makes up for it. And it totally does! Razor clams that are huge with some amazing garlic noodle topping. And the crab! I didn't care that I got it all over my rings and my elbow and hair and clothes and face. If I wasn't so full I'd drink that sauce straight up. Had one fried bun which was so soft and hot and yummy. But mostly just ate crab like a savage with my teeth. Using the crackers when necessary. Sweet and slightly spicy and messy and sticky and delicious. My favorite Singapore dining experience of the trip. My friends had some steamed fish and it looked nice but I had no room left to try. They chose the Sri Lankan crab and not sure why but so much sweet meat. Love chili crab!

The chili crab bao were just okay.  A bit under-salted, not as flavorful as I expected.  I wish they would pay more attention to how they make these.  I used them as a taste test to determine whether I would return to try their chili crab, after tasting these I think I'll pass. The bbq pork in pastry was really good. The best I've had so far. Huge chunks of meat and the bbq sauce was not overwhelming. It was perfect. Service was great, prompt and attentive.

Servers walk around with four cans, each with a different kind of sauce: two curries, two yoghurt-based ones. The latter are thick, creamy, but lightly flavoured and tangy.As for the rice-based dishes, the store isn't stingy with the rice: it usually arrives in the shape of a mountain, with the other ingredients in generous portions.The feel of the restaurant is very old-school, simple and plain with no frills. That somehow adds to the authenticity of the experience, where one can enjoy great-tasting vegetarian cuisine without having to pay a lot or squeeze with crowds for seating."

The menu is really simple, but they mostly sell Thosais, Pani Puris, an Chapatis. My Masala Thosai came out a little limp, but one the the sauces they provided really packed a punch. Would recommended coming here if you're in the vicinity and looking for a cheap bite."
