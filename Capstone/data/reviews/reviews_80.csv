Makko Teck Neo,35 Telok Blangah Rise #01-303 Singapore 090035 Singapore ,090035,1.27302201949382,103.82212324602,[],Jason L.,oGtf2Wbi2Wq6TTJecDZFMQ,"Singapore, Singapore",5,5/16/2017,"The Little Corner With Explosive Food The only reason why we heard of this place was because we heard it replaced Peramakan at TANGS Marketplace. After getting a taste of how good they were (and seeing how people constantly came by to buy their kuehs and nonya rice dumplings), we knew we had to try the food from their main restaurant at Telok Blangah. Firstly, I'd like to apologize for the lack of photos, especially of the food. We decided at the spur of the moment to rush down and take away a few dishes for a family lunch. Because of our hunger and over enthusiasm to try the food, we completely forgot about photos. Promise to upload a few the next time I'm there. Now.... back to food. I've noticed that there's been a lot of disagreements and ""arguments"" online lately about how ""authentic"" a Peranakan Restaurant is. Because of the many influences and different background of each family, and lack of belief in writing down recipes, there isn't really a genuine, authentic recipe for Nonya food. Sure, the basic ingredients are the same, but the way it's cooked varies from family to family. To me, good Nonya food needs to be the following: 1. it has to be fragrant. A lot of Peranakan dishes depend on a solid rempah (spice blend / paste) and this should stand out in all dishes2. It has to be delicious 3. It has to feel like it's prepare with love 4. It has to warm the soul Nonya Chap Chye ($14.90)After the trying so many variations of Chao Chye, from Singapore to Malacca, from home cooked to higher end restaurants, I can proudly say that this Chap Chye is up there with the best. The bean curd skin taste is not overpowering and compliments the natural sweetness of the cabbage very well and the vegetables are soft yet not overcooked to mush. Really delicious. Assam Fish Curry ($11.90)Wow..... just wow! What's great about this Assam is that it's not overly spicy but it packs a punch. Be warned, the first bite might feel a bit overpowering, with an explosion of sourness, tanginess and slight sweetness, with each bite feeling like mini fireworks going off in the mouth but as you keep eating, the flavours mellow down, leaving a nice, almost soothing after taste in the mouth. Beef Rendang ($14.90)Another dish cooked with a lot of care and love. The sauce was slightly on the spicy side (very spicy to the wife who's a non-chilli eater) but it certainly packed a punch. The sauce was fragrant and rich without being overpowering. Once the initial spiciness cleared, the rempah came through, showcasing the fragrant spices used, mixed in with the beefiness from stewing the Rendang. Most importantly was the beef. It was cooked to perfection. Wonderfully tender, the meat fell off the fork while we were trying to pick it up. Another very well executed dish. Ayam Buah Keluak ($16.90 + $5.00 for 2 seeds of Buah Keluak)My holy grail of Nonya Cuisine. My biggest weakness and most absolute must have for any Peranakan Restaurant and the ones here have the best Buah Keluak I've had..... ever! Firstly, it's interesting how they used a mixture of Pork Ribs and Chicken instead of just solely chicken. The proteins were cooked perfectly, juicy and tender. Interestingly, because we took away, they actually separated the protein from the Buah Keluak. This gave us the chance to taste the rempah separately and again, it was very good. Fragrant and very tasty, the sauce acted as an enhancement to the protein and not over power it but the spotlight definitely goes to the Buah Keluak. Removed from the shells, blended smooth and re-stuffed, the Buah Keluaks tasted almost like a paté, packed with that rich, delicious black gold. Should you want the more familiar style of Ayam Buah Keluak, feel free to mix it both together. We did that eventually and the thick, black yumminess of the Buah Keluak helped elevate the rempah to another level. 2 thumbs and 2 toes up for me! Nonya Rice Dumpling ($3.90 at TANGS Marketplace) Ma little pricy in terms of rice dumplings (maybe because it's TANGS). I have to admit, my favourite is still Kim Choo but that could just be me being bias. However, it still was a pretty good Nonya Zhang. The rice is not as fragrant and tasty as other I've tried but it did compliment the filling well, ensuring that the sweetness, saltiness and juiciness of the filling took centre stage. Pineapple Tarts ($19.00 - we think)First bite? We were disappointed. The pastry wasn't as buttery or flavourful as some of the other tarts we've tried but once we reached the filling we understood why. The filling was very very good. The Palm sugar shone through and there was a richness and depth to it that a lot of other pineapple filling didn't have. It felt like it was prepared the traditional way, stewing hours in a copper pot and allowing the sweetness, tartness and spices to blend into a yummy, gooey mix. On a whole, we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the food was way above expectations!"

Always one of my favorite local dishes for its craftiness, where an almost overwhelmingly bold sauce is paired with tofu, cucumber and sprouts, inherently bland tasting elements.  Pure genius!Nonya Ngoh Hiang.  Makko's version of this local Teochew classic is lightly crunchy on the outside, filled with juicy morsels of minced meat and has a nice aromatic spiciness to balance all the gravidity of this deep-fried meat spring roll wrapped in tofu skin.Chicken Wings.  These are deep-fried as well in a batter that confers on each morsel a thick armored plating of screamingly hot, crunchy, spicy, gingery, greasy, juicy goodness.  I cannot thick of a better arch-nemesis to Korean-style fried chicken which has skin that is almost painted on and air light. I recommend having these fresh with a cold beer where you can slowly pick apart every bit of the wing and enjoy every spicy, crunchy bit of armor plating.  The subtle yellow ginger flavor suffusing every bite is pure genius."

I know you might think ""why IKEA????"" but the food in IKEA Singapore is so unique and delicious!!!!!!!! They have the classic meatballs but I highly recommend getting the pork knuckle or the chicken wings!!!!! The chicken wings are fried perfectly and have an amazing flavour!!!! On the other hand the boneless pork knuckle is massive and extremely juicy!!!! Honestly if you're able to finish the pork knuckle you're a legend (it's that big!!!!!!)!!!! Also definitely try their ice cream!!!!!!!! The ice cream is soy flavour which is really unique and it is very refreshing especially in the hot weather in Singapore!!!!! If you want to try something different or just want a challenge definitely go to IKEA!!!!! You might want to get there early though because it gets rammed pretty early!!!!"

It was near to 2pm, and there was still a queue extending back pass the drinks & coffee island. But luckily the queue moved fast.We ordered the 2 must do - the meatballs and the fried chicken wings. Additionally, we ordered the fish& chips and the confit of duck. We also had the Swedish fruit flavour drinks.The meatballs goes well with the sauce and cranberry sauce. There were lots of meatballs with a good amount of boiled potatoes.The duck was also good and it came with boiled potatoes and steamed vegetables (carrots). The duck meat was tender and goes well with the given sauce. it was tasty. You get an entire duck drumstick. The chicken wings was crispy and moist. It was marinated very well and was tasty. It was very good.The worst dish was fish and chips. It mediocre and basic. You get a breaded fish with chips. It came with the normal tartar sauce. The fried part of the fish was crispy but overall it was rather cold probably it was dished on the plate out of the heating lamp waiting for some poor customer to take it.The Swedish fruity drink was refreshing as it was very fizzy. Unfortunately Ikea does not provide ice at this location. So the cold drink quickly became room temperature while you dig in to the main course. It was very refreshing and cool when you first got it from the dispenser. It seems that all drinks are refillable"

Things are kept simple here: you first place and pay for your order at a counter, then move along in a somewhat production-line fashion to wait for your food to be prepared upon presentation of your receipt. The magical part is there is hardly ever a queue so you are literally seconds from a hot steamy sausage bun.The hotdog is of course the best seller. Its so ridiculously simple, cheap and good it makes you realize those people paying for $5 hotdogs outside zouk must be seriously drunk. It consists of a boiled medium length chicken sausage (ain't no bratwurst) sandwiched between a fresh bun, and you move on to dress it with the sauces of your choice, my favorite being an excessive amount of mustard and chilli sauce. Since last year they have also introduced a chilled chocolate doughnut that is not mind blowing but still sweet enough to fix that sugar craving.The only thing I never liked from the bistro is the signature lingonberry drink. It tastes so weird and doesn't appeal to my Asian palette at all. I have never met anyone who likes it, I wonder why they insist on keeping it on the menu.

And save room for dessert! Daim pie (yes Daim as in the candy) is a favorite, as is princess cake when it's available. If you like the food, do check out the food shop downstairs, because a lot of that stuff is available frozen to bring home."

Timbre + is a considered, thoughtfully laid out, and well put together concept.  Take for example the height of the ceiling and the prodigious number of Big Ass Fans that are lazily whirring overhead to keep the entire interior of this, essentially al fresco space airy, breezy and cool without being uninvitingly cave-like. To me, this demonstrates one very important thing.  The powers that be of this place had the good sense to get the basics right without being totally overwhelmed by their enthusiasm for a fancy concept.   This happens all too often in Singapore where you have a totally awesome concept that falls flat on execution because nobody bothered to sit down and sweat the details, things like the ambient temperature, how tables are going to be bussed, and how a capacity crowd could be seated comfortably.  Kudos, Timbre + bosses!!Put simply, I WANT Timbre + to succeed because success suggests the following:1.  That more of Singapore will be explored for dining and entertainment.  You don't have to be downtown to be a success.2.  Singaporeans are a discerning enough crowd to know a good thing when they see it and are not deterred by unconventional locations.3.  Unconventional locations = lower rents = more investment in quality.  If we could only get enough Singaporeans behind this concept, we could all enjoy better quality, more consistency and fewer chain concepts.4.  The Singapore palate would have the space and the opportunity to mature, become more sophisticated and more discerning.  Ultimately, this is a good thing.  More variety, fresher preparations, higher quality ingredients and less reliance on bulk and mass-production is a good and healthy thing."

We sampled quite a few dishes, with my favorite being the most delicious calamari I've ever had - it was so buttery and fried to perfection.

As you draw deeper into the warehouse like place, you'll see the stage for the live band and more food options. On a Wed night, about half of the stalls were often, most of which were non-traditional options (ie: French, Indian Kati rolls, Spanish tapas). I ordered a French Onion Soup from the French stall and a Chicken Kati Roll from the Indian stall. My friend tried the Japanese rice bowl and Salted egg fries from Kuchi.  Sadly I was underwhelmed by all 4 items we had on our shared table. There was a live band who sung Bohemian Rhapsody during our dinner. The fans created a surprisingly well ventilated and casual  atmosphere, but the food was unimpressive and not cheap.

Remember to show that you have a Pokeman Go account, where you will get a lucky dip which could be a discount or a free drink. Chicken Wings ($8.60/ 6 pieces)Topped with chilli crab sauce.

The version here was more tangy sweet.Food Anatomy is a stall which offered food such as Nasi Lemak, Salted Egg Prawn on Charcoal Bun in cube forms. We selected 3 items on the display shelves which cost $10.80.Cold SobaThe sauce was in a kind of gel form on top of the soba. The sauce was not bad, but a bit too little and let down by the bland and slightly uncooked soba.Pork LasagneColorful looking with black, green and pink pasta sheets. It was quite moist and tasty.Yuzu Cream with Matcha GenoiseThe yuzu cream was light and refreshing, but melt easily, which helped to keep the matcha cake below moist. Could not really taste the matcha flavour below."

Also, they have a live band which is always a nice touch, even when the band is soso, because, let's be honest, you're here for the food, aren't you?Uhm... let's just say that once you try the food you start wishing you came for the band. I tried Food Anatomy which serves small dishes in blocks, difficult to describe but very instagramable so I am sure you can find some pics online. It was all about the looks though, we did not finish our dishes and decided to go to the Star Vista to get other food.However, since I liked the atmosphere I decided to give the place another try a few months later. Since I am a big fan of a good Kaisen Don I tried out Teppei Daidokoro. Again... fail: it does not compare to the other branches of Teppei, the fish was slightly warmish (for raw fish?) and had only salmon with the tiniest sprinkle of ikura. My friend had a po-boy from Big Bern's American Grill and mentioned that Louisiana should ban these people for insulting their signature dish!I would describe this place as a hipster hawker centre gone wrong but according the website it is a gastropark - to each their own I guess, but not for me."

We decided to visit timbre+ for TGIF with zero expectation. My group of friends, 4 of us, arrived at 9pm. We noticed that the space is huge with ample of seats available to host large groups of people. It was fully packed with people at that time, music level is high with the band (Supersonic) on Friday night and a pretty warm location despite huge fans spinning on top of our heads.Within minutes, we were able to find ourselves seated in a comfortable position enjoying the music brought to us by local band. Particularly I love the female lead singer from Supersonic, whose energy level was really high with her singing and dancing on stage. Towards the end of their 2nd set of the night, the male lead singer came down the stage and engaged the audiences with friendly handshake and singing together with the audiences. I thought it was really perfect performances for the night!We split up and got ourselves some food for sharing. We ordered food from Chit Chaat Chai, Teppei Daidokoro, Kush and Two Wings. There are too many stalls to explore and try within one night, so I'm sure this entices multiple visits to this place! We had a papdi chaat from Chit Chaat Chai, a popular indian snack/street food in India - a dish mixed with yogurt, mini papadum, some mint and indian spices. A mixed platter of yakitori from Teppei Daidokoro, salted egg yolk fries, luncheon fries and skewers from Kush, and salted egg yolk wings from Two Wings. Good thing that the salted egg yolk from fries are separated in a bowl from the fries, we did not get sick over 2 dishes of salted egg yolk in one night. The food selection is really great with so many options to choose from! The only dish I dislike for the night are the skewers from Kush, should just stick to Teppei next time.Now, Timbre is known for their beer and pizza. Beer selection was a total disappointment from this space, and the purchase takes a very long time. There is no sight of Timbre pizza too. There are fridges stocked up with craft beer only, and Archipelago draft on tap. I was hoping to get a tower of beer for all my friends for sharing, but nope, no tower available. I guess there is something they could do about to the payment of beer purchase for sure. There is only 1 counter for payment. Well, but I'm pretty cool with everything, because there's so much other positive stuff over this beer counter.We spent less than $40 per pax for the entire night with good food and entertainment. It's quite worth it with a bunch of friends to chill out. Cab home is problem. We can barely find any cab on the road, so we walked over to the main street and waited a while before we can get home. It's also a great space for family too! I saw really small babies in the arms of mummies, and they are not crying babies!On the other hand, we spotted normal hawker stalls on our way out, like fish soup, fruit juice, handmade noodle stalls etc. We also notice the graffiti sprayed outside the container, all done by local talents.  It's an exciting space with a lot of local flavour, which I give it 5 stars! However, in Singapore, you probably still need some cooling space... or awesome cold beers. I'll be back for more, and I'm so glad and proud that Timbre came up with such awesome space!"

I got the impression many places probably closed around 3pm - over half the stalls were shut.  Visually, it makes a great impression - there's great street art on the outside, and the combo of stalls and food trucks and art is really cute on the inside. I didn't have any problems with the heat - there was plenty of wind from the million fans they have,The tray return was a highlight, unfortunately, which shouldn't be the case when you're going for food.

We're not at a restaurant!"" We wound up spending $26 on Indian food that was served mostly *cold*. Not just room temperature, but actually cold. (Shocking, considering how hot it is here - I'm not sure how they managed that.)  The set meals were a ridiculously large portion of rice with some small scoops of cold vegetables. The butter chicken was a small dish with about 3 pieces of chicken in it, barely room temp.  The yellow dahl was the best thing we had - it was a nice consistency and good mixture of spices. The masala chai was also good -  everything else was mediocre and there wasn't much of it...  we wound up throwing away half of it as who wants to eat cold potatoes on a mountain of rice?The bottle shop looks adorable, but SG$15 for a pear cider and a bottle of water just seemed insane.  There's free wifi but you have to register with your phone number and a bunch of other info in order to use it so we didn't bother.All in all, we spent SG$42 on what amounted to mostly rice and a little bit of cold food plus a nice cup of tea... I certainly won't come again.  Go to a proper hawker centre for good food at reasonable prices, or go to a proper restaurant for better food and and the same amount of money."

And:(2) Save money by paying the one-time installation cost of the coin-return mechanism thing (maybe at most a few K), instead of paying some auntie $800 a month to do the job.This money-making scheme can then also be couched under the guise of the stupid and misguided progressive ""returning your tray"" is somehow morally good notion. The hipster fools who love such hipster hawker centres are probably also the same fools who fall sway to such ""progressive"" notions. KNN timbre+ and these hipsters."

Sharing Damian's place is the cute little coffee kiosk, Blue Collar Collaborative. Friendly baristas. Dusk by Slake offers some well-priced and delicious meat roasts. Order by the grams. Douglas' fishball noodles are above average.  Not every day you see a 20 something year old Singaporean making his own fish balls. Clams ban mian is comforting especially on a rainy day. Add extra roasted chilli! The bottle shop is well stocked. American modern craft beer heavy with some Japanese (Baird beer, delish) and uk/aussie beers (which I mostly hate). Some ciders."

It is within walking distance from one north mrt station. The front part is made up of hawker stalls which are mostly closed at night. Once you walk in, you are greeted by colorful food trucks and a vibrant scene. The live music started at 8 plus and was impressive. Food wise I had duck confit from Garçons. The meat was tender and the serving was value for money. One friend had a bak kut Teh set which included drinks and was a good deal. Another friend had sashimi which was only so-so. We also shared fries with salted egg sauce which was addictive. We didn't try alcohol but there seemed to be a decent selection. Another cool thing is how the tray return area has a censor and returns you one dollar for each tray.

The food is fresh and delicious, the ambience cosy and warm. My go-to is the plain rosti (with sour cream and spring onions), chicken schnitzel (fried tender chicken breast with potato salad and cranberry jam) and sometimes a strawberry shortcake or mushroom soup. The crowd is alright on weekdays but be prepared to queue on weekends. I also recommend the pizzas, pastas and wraps. Everything is good here! They use a card payment system, so you'll be given a Marche card upon entry, and you use this card to pay for your food around the restaurant. Prices are reasonable for the quality. A rosti is about 10+ and the schnitzel about 15+. Highly recommended!"

If you don't want to queue a tleast 20 minutes on a thursday night at 7pm, make a reservation.There are lots of tables, some are bar top, and some are booths and some are just typical tables which you can join together to accomodate a big group.1. Watermelon JuiceThe watermelon juice tasted okay, nothing special. I would rather go elsewhere to get this watermelon juice.The rosti station had one of the longest queues!You can pick to have your rosti with sausages, smoked salmon and more.With so many potatoes placed here to decorate the stall, I wonder how much potatoes do they use on a daily basis.2. Rosti with Smoked Salmon $16.90+I loved how generous they were with the smoked salmon, covered the entire plate of rosti! The smoked salmon wasn't too salty, it was perfect and the rosti was crispy on the top layers and soft and warmed to perfection in the center. This was exactly how I remembered it 10 years ago. It seems quality standards remained the same over the past decade! *applause*3. Rosti with SausagesI picked both the chicken cheese sauage and the pork garlic sausage. The chicken cheese sausage was very juicy and flavourful. The pork garlic sausage (the shorter one) was a bit more dry and slightly harder to cut into. The sour cream added more flavour to the sausages.While waiting for my Rosti to be cooked, I watched this chef twirl and spin the pizza dough in the air, it was quite amazing and it made me want to try the pizza.4. Onion Chicken PizzaThe pizza looked fine, till we cut it up and saw the amount of oil in it. The onion was more for decoration as it seemed pretty raw. The chicken cubes were tiny and the cheese wasn't sufficient enough. The outside crust was crispy but the inner pizza was dough and pretty much all the ingredient slid right off the pizza. Very disappointing.5. PastaCheesy goodness and even the brocolli tasted awesome. A decent plate of pasta with simple flavours from the ham and brocolli6. Roasted Half Chicken with SausagesThe chicken was very tender and juicy, even the breast meat was juicy. The sausages here were the same as the ones that came with the smoked salmon.7. SaladThe salad seemed fresh, however there wasn't sufficient dressing on the salad. All in all, there were some hits and misses, and Yes I will go back for more rosti goodness, but I was surprised to see the bill of $140 for 4 pax. Is the food fresh? Yes sort of, I mean I can't say it's super fresh, but I know I didn't get sick from eating it. But the price just doesn't justify the quality of food we received."

My friend spotted it pretty quickly and hence we jumped the queue and was given the seat near to the kids' playground (slide).This restaurant do not have much seats available so you might have to wait till other patrons to be done with their food. Compared to the one in Somerset 313, it was narrower. There were plenty of choices (salad bar, crepes, pasta, rosti, dessert, beverages, etc). Upon going into the restaurant, you will be given a card that will be used to swipe the food or beverages you choose from the different sections and pay when you are about to exit the restaurant. The good part about this concept is that the crowds will not walk in and walk out from the same set of doors.I was craving for crepes and hence decided to go for pulled beef with pumpkin sauce. There was a line at that section but I was able to retrieve my order fast. My friend ordered the Smoked Salmon Rosti and it came out much later as there were longer lines formed there.Food wise, I love the crispy crepes and the ingredients were of perfect blend. The beef was chewy and juicy just like I wanted it to be. The portion was more than I expected. For the Smoked Salmon Rosti, it was my first time trying. Love the combinations of the salmon and the rosti. The crisp blended well with the slimy salmon slices. Would probably prefer it to be more smoked salmon slices on this dish.My friend decided to get sweet crepe for dessert. She chose banana chocolate crepe topped with rum ice cream. The banana were generous and the chocolate was not too sweet. This dish was not too sweet as I thought it will be by its look. Overall, this family friendly restaurant has tons to offer. From the indoor decoration to creating a space for the children so that the adults can chit chat. Price wise it is costly but I would not mind to spend a little more once in a while for good food :)"

I think there was a five day span last month where I ate here six times. The problem of sorts is that there are so many options that I can go twice in one day and have very different meals.The soups are good and seem to be made by hand with fresh ingredients. The fish seems extremely fresh. The rosti enables me to eat what is essentially a cake of french fries and not feel as bad about it because it is so fresh, and the raclette is divine. German sausage also goes well with it. My fiance loves the paella. The savory crepes have a little too much cheese but are good. The salads are wonderful except for the flies that usually surround the lettuce. The only thing I would definitely never have again here is the pasta, which comes in a watery soup-like tomato-flavoured liquid with awkward cubes of vegetable.The sweet crepes with mascarpone taste lighter than they probably are. I didn't like the plum dessert because it tastes like it is just plums cooked in a pie crust full of egg. The lemon meringue pie is so so so good. They are owned by or somehow affiliated with Moevenpick, which means they also have a case full of some of the best ice cream in the world, imported from Switzerland.Although revealing this holds a risk of making the lines even longer at checkout, one of the main draws of this place is that they discount about three items to $10-$13 each day for lunch, with a free drink. So it is kind of like they are encouraging variety."

The restaurant is located on the roof top of vivo city and they had tall glass windows all around so the possibility of it becoming a green house was high but they managed to keep the place nice and cool so that's a plus for sure in the hot and humid Singapore. another plus was that we quickly found the dessert station as it was less than 5 meters from the entrance. i was hoping to get ice cream with my waffle but it was a whooping $6 for a scoop on top of the almost $10 waffle with fruits option. i was happy to forgo the extra sugar and focus on  the natural mango that was fresh and juicy! the waffle was nice and crisp since it was made upon order. the lady at the station was super friendly and very generous with the toppings. thanks to her i had a satisfying meal and a pleasant time at the restaurant.the only reason i gave it 3 stars and not more is because of the price. i guess with so many cafes in Singapore serving more outstanding and more delicious waffles, their pricing seemed steep in comparison. if i do go back to Marche, it wouldn't be for their desserts but more likely for their other items on the menu."

Back then only the vivo branch existed. Based on my experience, not all the dishes are worth trying. If this is your first time trying this restaurant, here are some of my must-try and must-not-try dishes !Food1. Salad bar- pretty expensive for a small bowl of salad, there are a great variety of vegetables to choose from and most of them are pretty fresh ! Rating- don't bother ordering if you wish to fill your stomach with better food. 3/52. Pasta - marche uses fresh ingredients and their pasta are cooked to near perfection. Rating- worth trying. 4/53. Meat- in my opinion, they serve the best pork knuckle in town. You definitely have to try if you are coming in groups of 4 or more. Avoid ordering the steak as they usually cook in batches which ends up overcooking the steaks. Rating- definite must try for the pork knuckle 5/54. Savoury crepe- unique dish that you cannot really find on other places. However, the portion os pretty big and will be better if shared. Rating- recommended 4.5/55. Rosti- the signature dish of the restaurant. There will always be a long queue during peak hours. However, the potato is cooked to perfection ! They use good quality oil and the portion is just nice for one person. Rating- 4.5/5 6. Pizza/rice- only tried once for each dish. Pizza gives lots of toppings and the serving is huge ! The rice is pretty ordinary. Rating-3.5/57. Seafood - calamari rings are nothing special and do not taste that different from outside. Quite overpriced. Rating- 2.5/5Drinks1. Fruit juice- i do not recommend buying their fruit juice. They will pre-squeeze the drinks in the afternoon and leave it for the rest of the day. Hence they are not really fresh. They charge pretty high for the drinks too. Rating- 2.5/52. Fruit teas - has always been my preferred choice of drink over the years. They serve different selection where you can try before ordering. Rating -4/53. Beer/non-alcoholic drink- they serve a wide selection of non-alcoholic drinks and their beer/wine are also quite unique. Rating-3.5/5Deserts1. Cakes and tarts- they have a wide selection of pastries to choose from and most of them taste really good ! However you will be usually too full to eat more than a slice after meals. Rating- 4/52. Crepes/waffles- my favourite desert is the crepe of the week. No other restaurants have this uniqe dish. However the taste usually varies with the pastry chef. There are days when the crepe taste heavenly and days when it taste like soggy prata. I would recommend getting this crepe in somerset for better quality. Rating- 4/5"

As other reviewers have pointed out, you are given a card upon entering and you're free to use it as many times as you want at each station. Just don't get carried away with it or else you could be handing over your life savings and you wouldn't even know it. Haha. The food was pretty tasty but to be honest, the one thing that really stood out to me was the seafood paella. I could not stop eating it and really felt like getting seconds. Except there were other food to be devoured. My friend had other dishes and we shared the wealth at our tiny table for two. The only thing that I did not like was that it was rather cramped. I could literally hear the conversation of the table next to us, and holding hot plates of food while avoiding the crowd isn't safe. But I know I'll be coming back here if I ever visit Singapore again. Better yet, Marche, why don't you bring this chain to the States?"

It was one of the first restaurant to introduce the card system where all spending will be charged in a card handed to the customer and on leaving the place, produce the card to the cashier. The outlet at Vivocity is quite small and it feels especially so during weekends. Queues will form a long way outside the store waiting to be serve. What I usually order is the rosti and the crepes.The interior and exterior has the ambiance and design of a European farmhouse."

I find that both Marches make you 'get lost in time'. You can really take your own sweet time to dine and catch up with friends over food, without worrying you'll be chased out. What's more, it's got a nice and warm environment. Marche at VivoCity is kind of on its own at the third floor; so you have to walk out from the food court side to reach the restaurant. The usual thing I like about Marche is the nice variety of food, and considerably affordable prices. Also, what you see is what you pay, since there is no additional ++. Thumb up for a like!"

It was smoky and grilled to perfect tenderness. The dish was awesome with smoked roe, Gremolata, Borlotti Beans.Chargrilled Octopus - $22The Fisherman's Feast was a scrumptious meal for us. Their homemade hand-rolled linguine was commendable as it was lightly soaked and cooked in their seafood stock.

Thumbs up to the Fisherman's Feast!All were good from food to environment, perhaps a little shortcoming might be the lights in the restaurant which was quite dim, not an ideal environment for taking pictures.

This is the kind of stuff I love, when bartenders masterfully create UNIQUE cocktails with local ingredients in a chill ambiance. Frankly, I felt reminded of walking into a friend's house and hanging out in that type of setting. My girlfriend and I walked in at around midnight on a Saturday night and were surprised at how quiet it was. They mentioned that last call would be at 12:30 yet they didn't end up doing so until closer to 2 am so instead of only ordering 1 drink, I got 3 :PMy first was their version of Penicillin with honey, lemon juice, ginger and one of their whiskeys. Except this one they use some chocolate somewhere and do a float of Lagavulin on top and maybe some coconut in there? Took a while to make but that's because of the steps involved, and It is presented in a china type glass that you would drink tea out of along with some homemade tea jelly. This was incredible, definitely taste your usual Penicillin cocktail with a more local twist which is awesome. Easy to drink.The second drink was the bartender's off the menu Old Fashioned drink (since they served the last of one of their ingredients to the Fire Roasted Old Fashioned just beforehand). I don't remember what the bartender did but he did something to make this one sweet but addicting cocktail, definitely one of the best old fashioned twists I've ever had.The last drink was a classic drink that I tried for the first time, called the Boulevardier. I've always loved Negronis and Old Fashioneds, so they made me a drink that has elements of both. I'm hooked.My girlfriend ordered one of their milk drinks with pandan. Although it tasted great, it was just too rich. Difficult to drink more than a few sips.Bartenders are very cool and knowledgable. I love going into places where passion fuels what they do, and you can clearly see these in their drinks.Highly recommend checking this place out at anytime. From the sounds of it, there isn't any queue or wait time for now, so check it out before it starts getting more known and crowded!"

The sweetness of the palm sugar coupled with the strong yet smooth bourbon was heavenly. To top it off was a charred dehydrated pineapple slice, which gave the drink a charred/smokey finish. The other drink I tried was the Smokin' Pisang - banana infused bourbon, french fig cordial, sandalwood smoke. As you can tell, I'm a huge bourbon guy. The thought of Mixing banana with bourbon was just too difficult to pass up. I'm glad I didn't. :DThere are so many great cocktail bars in Singapore: Tippling Club, Manhattan, the Library, Cufflink Club and so many others. However, this particular cocktail is very unique in that its cocktails have an Asian Twist. You can't get that in New York. In my opinion, one of the best cocktail bars on the Island!"

My hotel is right around the corner, so for me this was a convenient location, but it's about 10-15 mins away from the CBD.

The place was pretty packed when we went at 1300hrs for lunch, and because we didn't make reservations, we were asked to come back at 1400hrs (SO, DO CALL IN BEFORE DROPPING BY!). We both had the set lunch (ranges from about $35-$50), which is quite reasonable for such a pricy place. It comes with soup, chowaimushi, salad, and the entrée. Let's just say that I experience heaven when I first ate the wagyu don. The meat was nice and tender, and I love the sauce on the rice so much I ate everything - that's a big deal because I'm not a great fan of rice!I was also pleased to see that they had an extensive selection of Umeshu.

I brought my wife here for our 2nd year wedding anniversary based on the glowing reviews on yelp.The Food was good, that's an understatement. The Ambience was sexy and dark, that's an understatement. The rice, yes I segregate rice from food because in my world rice reigns supreme, was sublime, that's an understatement.When you come to Fat Cow, there are two dishes you MUST order: the Wagyu steak (pick any grade, they are all out of this world) and the Fat Rice. The Wagyu at Fat Cow unlike any steak I've ever tried. It has the tenderness of a tenderloin yet the juicy taste of Ribeye. However, the pride and joy of Fat Cow is the PHAT Rice. ;-)  Perfectly cooked high grade Japanese rice layered with the oil drippings of the very Wagyu just prepared for you a few minutes prior.  Holy smokes!!!To tell you the truth, I started my dinner with the Fat Cow Donburi - Wagyu Beef with Onsen egg and shiro negi. However, as soon as I saw my wife's Wagyu place across from with the fat rice arriving soon thereafter, I immediately had buyers remorse. I ate my Donburi as I fast can, which was good, but no where near the quality of the Wagyu dish sitting across from me. As soon as I was done, I ordered exactly what my wife ordered and I had no regrets!This dinner was truly special in more ways than one. However, for me to judge Fat Cow purely on its merits, I would consider it among the very best dining experiences I have ever had.  Did I mention we also had Australian Pinot Noir to accompany our fabulous dinner. :-)"

They put too much truffle oil and ponzu that overpowers the fish. As for the donburi bowl. I'm happy that they gave a 1:1 foie/wagyu portion but was sad that the wagyu lack the natural beef flavor bc it was season with some garlic soy.

There was toro, salmon, scallops, hamachi, red snapper (last three not sure) and salmon roe. The toro melted in your mouth.. and all the fishes were super tender and fresh. The salmon also melted in your mouth which was unexpected because its salmon... ugh I loved this plate.The Fat Cow Donburi, 38Charcoal grilled wgayu beef with onset egg & shiro negi- wow. for some reason they failed to mention there was truffle on it. like why would you omit that from the menu? Nice surprise, and damn was the meat cooked perfectly and extremely tender and flavorful. Fat Foa-Gura Don, 45Glazed foie gras and grilled wgayu beef over rice. omg. everything about this bowl was perfect. added a poached egg on the side, but it wasn't necessary. The sauce on the meats were already enough and so so good.. and the rice with the sauce was great as well. This bowl was .... perfect. I was already full from the sushi but I couldn't stop eating because it was that good.. Also had red radishes (I think) on the side to go along with it.You would think a restaurant not focusing on any type of food and having all these different types of Japanese food would decrease its quality and taste, but not this one.

It's just like regular gohan with a few drops of soy sauce that the restaurant claims to be some legit oil (in fact, it's just like a plain gohan to be honest).I was hugely amazed by the glistening and gorgeous-looking Zosui rice though! I knew it, from the moment I saw it on the menu book that it would be such an incredibly astonishing meal. For those of you who wonder what the heck is Zosui, well, according to an encyclopedia, Zōsui is a Japanese rice soup made from pre-cooked rice and water. BUT! Instead of water, the Zosui in Fat cow is made of AUTHENTIC BEEF AND MUSHROOM BROTH! Can you imagine??! No? Okay, go try it yourself then. :DFor the drinks, my partner and I ordered a light alcohol drink with peach and lychee flavor, on the rock. The alcohol content was just nice for an early dinner, tastes slightly sweeter than Umeshu but I love it. The only disappointing thing was the amount served, just way too little. :(Service and interior wise, it was wonderful!"

I went for lunch instead cuz I wanted to try the highly raved 'The Fat Cow Donburi' ($39) from the lunch menu set. It's charcoal-grilled wagyu beef with onsen egg and shiro negi. Note that each set includes salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert. I finally know why everyone says this is a must eat from the lunch menu. The shiro negi enhance the whole bowl which makes every bite so delicious. We had Grade A3 Sirloin (100g) in Sukiyaki style ($78) and Blackmore Ranch 220g ($85) as well. Both were heavenly, more in review.Two weeks before while making my reservations online, I causally put a special note which says, 'celebrating a friend's birthday'. After that, I totally forgotten about it. But to my surprise, we were served with a happy birthday platter with a scoop of ice cream after our meals. Ah best service ever. :)"

Us group of ladies decided on a Friday treat and managed to snag an inside table for 6. Most of us ordered the donburi despite the carbo threat - honestly, don't waste a single grain of the perfectly plump, chewy, sticky short-grain rice; it's that good. While 1 friend took the Hokkaido don (with seasonal seafood), 3 others ordered the Wagyu donburi with onsen egg while 2 of us went for the foie gras & wagyu donburi. The wagyu was everything you hope it would be - fat glistening cubes of meat that almost melted in the mouth with no resistance. I didn't expect the cubes of wagyu to be of such high quality - at least A3 if not higher.  The crisp pan-seared cubes of foie gras also had a nice smoky char that added to the fragrance of the bowl. I love my fatty (eg flavourful) meats, so this portion was perfect. Some thought it was a little too much but finished up anyway. The lunch set also includes miso soup, salad, a chawanmushi and dessert, all of an amazing quality that gives you a taste of the full fledged experience.Lunch sets available from Mon-Fri only, 12-3pm."

However, with the downward revision of the already affordable lunch sets, I don't think anyone would be deterred from checking FC out. Each set comes with salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert with your choice of mains. Pick from the 12 mains which are priced from $25 to $48. Don't worry if you're not a beef fan, there are sashimi, pork and chicken on the menu too.The chawanmushi was topped with a light tasting crab sauce and it has prawn, mushroom and scallop in it.We ordered the Kinoko ($14), assorted Japanese mushrooms braised with sake, lime and butter. Honestly, it tasted like normal stir fry with a tinge of lime. A disappointment really. And it was a rather small portion.We also tried the Nasu Dengaku ($10), barbecued eggplant glazed with honey miso. This is a tiny baby Japanese eggplant and it certainly isn't worth the price tag. There was a plum undertone in the salty miso which didn't sit well with the girls.We had the 2 hot favorites at Fat Cow, which is the Fat Foa-Gura Don ($42) and The Fat Cow Donburi ($38). It was a tussle between the 2 choices but here's the flavor profiles so that you can decide for yourself! The Fat Foa-Gura Don has the rich and buttery glazed foie gras chunks and grilled wagyu beef cubes. The sauce was a little on the sweet side but the overall flavor is strong and heavy. I liked the toppings on this one but i found the rice to be a little on the dry side and it acted like a sponge, soaking up all the oil from the goose liver..The Fat Cow Donburi is a simpler dish in comparison but it has its own merits. Charcoal grilled Wagyu Beef with a light garlic flavor, with onsen egg and shiro negi. The first thing we noticed about the dish was its truffle aroma.Break the egg and mix everything together and enjoy the moist and flavorful rice. Absolutely delicious."

Forget the fancy Japanese meat dishes and just go for the slab of steak. They have Japanese, Australian and US. Skip the rest and head for the Japanese to really sample authentic wagu cooked to perfection. Order medium rare at most. Anything more cooked is sacrilege. Side dishes are meager but very good. The stuffed zucchini flowers are excellent, as are the various salads. Order the smaller portion of meat. Your wallet and stomach will thank you. The high fat content will fill you if you take the time to savor each piece. This is not the time to wolfing down your meal. Chew more times than you normally do before swallowing to get the full experience.  A side dish of fat rice is the perfect accompaniment.  Be prepared to pay through your nose though, but for that special occasion, go for it."

I had asked for rare, and dark chunks of over-cooked beef and foie gras (meagre serving) was just not what I had hoped for. I sent it back and the second time, it was still slightly overcooked but I did not want to send it back the second time.

Light and crisp yet extremely more-ish. Love. We also had the wagyu ox tendon pan seared foie gras and daikon ... the flavor was really brought out by the fact that it was slow cooked although I'm personally not a fan of ox tendon, and was nicely balanced by the daikon. We opted for shabu-shabu and charcoal grill, and was recommended the Japanese Grade A5 and the US Wagyu respectively. Both turned out absolutely mindblowingly out of this world delicious.

The waiter explains that the beef is priced per 100grams, but you have to pay for a minimum of 200 grams, and the chef weighs the piece that they have, so you have no idea what it is going to cost. We got a cut each of the Australian Wagyu and the US Wagyu for $360. Between four people that is a ridiculously small amount of beef for the price.Starters were the dumplings and the sashimi special for $120 and it is itty bitty portions. Now the food was delicious, but there is no way you can justify that price for some raw fish that would fit on the average side plate.The beef was decent, but it does not take that much experience to cook it medium. We popped a bottle of wine for $170 and that rounded out the whole overcharged experience.A couple of tips for the management:1. Charge less or serve more. Your menu is misleading, and I hate being ripped off.2. If your restaurant is empty, why were some menu items unavailable?3. Train your servers better. Every time I took a sip from my glass, the waiter refilled it. In addition, they hovered around our table watching us before ordering, and watching us eat. Majorly annoying when you are trying to enjoy yourself with friends.4. Change the name and the location, they are both stupid.5. Better yet, just close up. You are not offering an awesome enough experience for $160 per head"

I am always on the look out for a nice slab of marbled meat. So far, Fat Cow's steak is the best I've ever tried. Being a big fan of steaks, I ordered the A5* wagyu steak, seared to medium rare.*A5 is the highest grade being awarded to wagyu beef. It is determined based on its marbling score, meat colour and brightness, firmness and texture of meat, and color/quality of fats.The steak was 300g and cost $298++. That comes up to more than $1/g and every mouthful that I took was probably worth $10 but it was so worth it! The divine taste of beef, fats that melted away without giving a greasy feeling, coupled with the grainy yet tender texture of the meat created the perfect steak ever. Every bite that I took, I went straight into heaven, lingered there for awhile, before coming back down for another bite. It was really that good. Of course, this was also the most expensive steak I've ever eaten so I was glad it measured up to expectations. The steak was served with a shoyu dip with grated ginger and sesame. Initially, I was skeptical about dipping such a marblellous piece of steak into shoyu but wow, the shoyu brought out the sweetness of the beef!!! We also asked for some freshly grated wasabi to pair with the beef because we liked that combination.We also ordered a few other dishes to share before the steak arrived. Traditional 'onsen-egg' served warm with a hunk of crispy fried beef bone marrow in a citrus dashiThe bone marrow was crispy and light with a tinge of sweetness while the citrus dashi added a refreshing taste. Break apart the yolk and you have a creamy balance of sweet and saltiness. A perfect appetiser!The zucchini stuffed with snow crab was amazing! The tempura was light and crispy yet not oily and there was a large amount of crab meat inside. The crab meat was fresh and sweet. We also had the choice of dipping it into mustard which excited our tastebuds. Overall, this was a unique dish and we loved it.Barbecued eggplant glazed with honey misoI am not a fan of eggplants but this was pretty good. After scraping off some of the miso (as it was too salty for my liking), the eggplant was actually palatable! It was so soft it almost melted in the mouth and I loved the slight chargrilled taste. The honey miso made it a really appetising dish indeed.Grilled gamba carabinerosI was really excited to see gamba carabineros on the menu. Gamba carabineros are a type of Spanish red prawn and ever since I ate them in Barcelona, I could not stop thinking about them. Like the ones I had in Barcelona, these were simply grilled with sea salt. The prawn was sweet and fresh but not as fresh as the ones in Barcelona as the meat was not as firm. Still one of the better prawns in Singapore though! For gamba carabineros, you MUST eat the brain juice! According to the chef in Barcelona, that is the best part of the prawn and the reason why gamba carabineros are so highly prized. Do not worry though, for the juice is really sweet.Handmade mochi with peanut and green tea powderThe mochi was extremely soft and chewy, sweet but not cloying. I preferred dipping it into the green tea powder for a slight bitterness.Milk pudding with red beansThis dessert was disappointing. While the pudding was smooth, it lacked taste and the red beans were too dry to help. This left an unpleasant taste and texture in our mouth.SummaryCost: ~$580 for 2 people, with 4 alcoholic drinksFood: Excellent steak! You have to order the A5!!!Service: Polite but slightly slowAmbience: Romantic, counter seating recommendedDress code: Smart casualWill I recommend it? Definitely!"

Crispy and fish is also nicely seasoned. 3) Chicken Chop with pasta - pasta is al dente and reckon it's the same tomato sauce. The pasta is not very flavourful as the sauce just coats the pasta. The chicken chop is well grilled and I like the brown sauce that coats it. Overall a nice dish. 4) Pizza - dough is actually quite good and fight with other no name pizza places. All in all a good place to get quality Italian fare at foodcourt prices. I like!

The itamaes won't deliver that based off the audience that dines. That being said, the atmosphere is much more fun and relaxed then high end sushi-ya.3) The sushi is good, flown in fresh from Japan. Because of the travel involved, it does command a higher price then Tokyo. They actually have someone pick out the fish from the fish market then send it off to Singapore, very neat.4) I did get to try some really good sushi that you won't see at Ginza restaurants.

Its façade is clean, simple, unassuming, yet extremely elegant--very typical Japanese décor. When you walk in, a bevy of beautiful Japanese waitresses dressed in kimonos greet you and show you to your seat. This is a small restaurant with about 14-16 seats at the counter, and one standalone table for 2 so chances are you will be seating at the counter so you can chat with the sushi chefs.Shinji has a small menu with 3-set courses: Tsuki (a 12-piece set - $125 Sing), Yuki (a 14-piece set - $185 Sing) and Yume (omakase special w/ about 14-16 pieces/dishes - $250 Sing). I of course had the Yume because I am a piggy. Also, keep in mind there will be several additional surcharges tacked onto your bill. Singapore charges a premium when it comes to fine dinning. For 2 people with 2 omakase and non-alcoholic drinks, we paid around $800 Sing so don't be shocked when you see all the surcharges. Also, there is a 10% service charge so tipping is optional. However at this kind of establishments and their impeccable level of service, these waitresses really do deserve an additional tip so don't be one of those stingy Asians!Since the menu changes frequently, there's no point for me to rate each of the dishes I had.

I don't think the waitresses were Japanese either, they sounded Singaporean which doesn't feel as authentic unfortunately unlike other top spots in the city.I hate giving bad reviews to places that give a lot of joy to a lot of people but this was my second straight disappointing and frustrating experience at a Shinji property. You're spending a lot of money to have that perfect omakase experience from beginning to end and personally, I did not. Some pieces of sushi were even fishy tasting to me and the cooked stuff as a whole was just okay. It's a chain to me these days and I'm truly not a fan of Japanese restaurants where the head chef is rarely there to put his heart, passion and artistry into each course for you. You spend this kind of money for their own personal craft and although some 3 Michelin Star sushi restaurants around the world do this too (Masa in NYC comes to mind), the chef is almost always actually there. To each their own, however, and I understand Shinji probably has the grandest name for sushi in Singapore so definitely check it out if you are omakase hopping around Singapore as much as I do.The good - the restaurant space in the St. Regis is absolutely beautiful.
