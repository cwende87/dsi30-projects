The steamed prawns with garlic was just flat out not good. Can easily tell the prawns were not fresh. The texture was completely mushy on every single piece. The only decent plate was the veggie, which is incredibly hard to mess up. Should have known something was to since there was only 3 tables occupied at close to peak hours.

How did it take so long for us to realise how awesome it is?!They're a seafood restaurant but they also do meat dishes pretty well. A lot of their main dishes take time to prepare (it could be a half hour wait, or even longer during peak dining hours) but the wait is seriously worth it.If you're already hungry, I'd start with the salted egg fried fish skin appetizer. WARNING: These are extremely addictive. Crispy, just the right amount of salt, and not at all fishy. Almost like potato chips.They even have a chicken rice stall within the restaurant, so you could order from them if you need something to hold you over while you wait.The crab dishes here are fantastic. We've tried the steamed crab with hua diao wine, and the steamed crab with glutinous rice. If I had to choose, I'd go with the glutinous rice, because that in itself is already delicious.Last but not least, I really love their kou rou bao (steamed buns with marinated braised pork belly.) Again, this dish takes time to make, but DAMN SON. The pork is so tender and the sauce is boss.This is a great spot to go to if you have a big group, as the round tables can fit about 8 people each. Plus, the portions are big here, so they're meant for sharing."

This place opened along Joo Chiat Road a couple of years ago under the name ""Ubin Seafood"" owned by the people who formerly ran the original seafood restaurant on Pulau Ubin.To further add to the confusion, in 2012 there was a change of management, and the name of the place changed from ""Ubin Seafood"" to ""Ubin Kitchen"". Chatter on the internet forums tells me that the head chef from the original Ubin establishment still helms the kitchen.Complicated history aside, it's possible to rattle off a laundry list of signature dishes that one should order:Steamed crab & glutinous rice (for 3-4 persons at $58)Bamboo ClamsOyster Hokkien NoodlesSteamed belly pork buns (Kou Rou Bao)fried shrimp rolls (hae zhor)salted egg yolk squidfried rice noodles (bee hoon)In particular, the oyster noodles were tender and had a hearty sauce, old school style. You see clams in the photo but there's some oysters somewhere hiding beneath the noodles. The pork buns were a DIY affair, fluffy steamed buns arrive separate from the pork and you'd have to create your pork sandwich yourself.

The steamed buns came hot and fresh, while a separate plate held five slices of marinated braised pork belly. A a bit of a Do-it-yourself burger where you take a strip of pork belly put it inside a steam bun. If you'd like, you can also add a strip of lettuce to make it the more ""healthy."" :PAs for the steamed crab, it was nothing short of special. This is not just some crab you put in a steamer and that's it. Nope, these crabs have a sophisticated flavour that blends hua diao wine with the juices of the crab. Wow. While all the crabs in Singapore focus on Chili Crabs or Pepper Crabs, it was nice to try something different for a change.Overall, the food at Ubin Kitchen was fantastic! Food wise, I'm of the view that it's 4.5 stars, but have settled on 4 stars since the server did not inform us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for both dishes."

It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The steamed crab is cooked in hua diao wine and ginger.

We loved japanese food and the first restaurant that caught our eye was this as we were too hungry to search for the mall directory. We had never tried the food at this restaurant before and was rather intrigue by its menu. They don't service the usual japanese fare. There are a lot of stewed and nabe (hot pot) in their menu. They also dish out food for the health conscious as you can choose the 5 grain rices and all. Great discovery and will definitely check out their other joints.

Sitting in the coffee shop, one feels immediately immersed in the life of the heartlands, with the friendly Indian uncle who greets you in Chinese or dialect and never fails to crack us up. However, any local would know that Mr. Teh Tarik is a chain store with outlets in many places, a representation of the capital progress of our nation. This particular outlet is my favourite though for the atmosphere - a real, old-school coffee shop that never fails to remind me of what Singapore is to me. The prata here is crispy and not bad, and of course, the teh tarik is good too. For those who like to hang around the area, it is an excellent place for supper when it is not so hot to be sitting outdoors. The prices are reasonable at a dollar for the teh tarik, so it is inexpensive too. For the friendly neighbourly feel that is quintessentially the Singapore I remember, I'd definitely be back for many times more in the future ahead."

Then we ordered the set meal for 8 but they said we couldnt have it as ""no big prawns"" so we had to think all over again for a la cart which was only $80 less with less dishes and no doubt lowe value food. The fried rice was only egg no seafood for $ 26 and one small bowl each. The service continued to be inept and nonchalant, even rude. We didnt feel we were wanted there.

The famous pepper and chili crabs lived up to their hypes. All other foods were fantastic. Every dish that we ordered was good.

Once she took the initiative order, she checked with the chef on the ingredients and to warn him to wash the woks before preparing these special dishes. I noticed she was wearing a hair net after talking with the chef. This made me think there is a high standard level of cleanliness in the kitchen.All the dishes we ordered were equally great. Plus she order exactly the correct amount so nothing was left for 14 people. We have no idea how much we ordered of each item so we're now anticipating the bill. What did we get?Chili and pepper crab. I preferred the black pepper both both were good.  I liked the vegetable dishes. The produce is very fresh. One was Chinese broccoli and scallops and the other dragon greens, mushrooms and garlic. Cereal shrimp (okay but others liked it), beef and onion, fried cod (cubed) and shrimp friend rice. Lastly the mini buns were light and the outside crust lightly crunchy. With about 5 sodas and 10% service, the total price was $750 for 14 or about $50 a person. The service was fantastic.

Honestly, I was a bit disoriented.  Sweet is dessert for me, not a main course.  Maybe it was an off night, and more sugar was added than less.  Maybe I'm spoiled with phenom Indo-Vietnamese-Malaysian-Chinese-Cambodian-Lao-Korean-Thai chefs educating my palate in Los Angeles.  Maybe.  Willing to cut some slack here but if this dish should be soulfully sweet, then that was the last time I will have had the famous chilli crab.  I can't claim the crabmeat tasted sweet because it didn't (the creature traveled from another country).  Had it been caught in the nearest river or sea, it would have been sweet.   The other dishes we ordered were very good however:  prawns with golden salted egg, mee goreng Malay style, kang kong, fried rice.   Service was very good.Tip:  Jumbo Seafood is also a tourist destination, prices are high, even for Singapore.  I'd come to this location if you were to visit as it's on the water, if you like H20.  Check out the Yelpista pix."

Suppressing all scepticism, I took a visiting friend to Jumbo which is one of the four chilli crab Meccas here all lined conveniently next to each other along East Coast park. We got one chilli crab to share between two of us which cost around $62. No chilli crab is complete without deep fried buns to mop up the gravy and Jumbo's are just sheer perfection: crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside with just a slight sweetness to them. At this point, I need to throw up my hands and admit that YES Jumbo's serves some pretty damn good chilli crab. The gravy is delicious. Rich and thick, the best part is the sharp kick to it at the end. I was expecting it to be a lot spicier than it was but it had too much flavour packed into it to make up for it. The crab itself was juicy and tender. We struggled to get all the flesh out of the shell but it's worth prying out every little bit. The atmosphere is also incredibly relaxing especially if you snag an outside table right next to the ocean. The staff were all very prompt and efficient. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they made no motion to hurry us and even gave us a 10% discount at the end for no reason! My only gripe is the very small vegetarian selection which is somewhat understandable at a seafood restaurant. My mother got rice with vegetable stir fry which came in a tiny portion costing $18.

Quality of the crab is excellent - sweet fresh crab that goes well with the sauce. The black pepper crab is not as good though so perhaps stick to the chili crab for Jumbo.

Although I love crab, my boyfriend isn't a fan but we still decided to go because our new friends in Hong Kong raved about trying pepper and/or chili crab. We ordered:- Chili crab- Fried cod fish with spicy sauce- Scallops wrapped in yam ring- Broccoli with scallops- Steamed (white) buns and deep fried bunsThe chili crab was wonderful! The crab we received, a portion size for three people, was the largest crab I've ever seen!! Certainly fitting considering the name of the restaurant. I'm not usually a fan of filling up on bread, but it was difficult to resist dipping the steamed buns in the chili crab sauce. And.. this is was after I ate spoonfuls on top of my rice. So much flavor!The broccoli with scallops were fine, but the scallops wrapped in yam were even better! My boyfriend almost decided to get a second order of them. Finally, the fried cod fish was delicious! I would order that again as well. Our bill ended up around SGD 200-250.. If you're not opposed to taking a day trip to Malaysia (possible via bus, car or taxi), we were told you can get much more pepper or chili crab for much cheaper there! Regardless, I highly recommend you check this place out if you're in Singapore! Extra tips and FYIs:- There is no AC!- Make reservations if you want to avoid a long wait during certain days or times.- The menu has plenty of pictures and English to help guide your ordering.- Chili crab can be quite messy; I recommend using the disposable bibs they give out.- Don't be afraid to flag down any server you see if you need something!- If you have trouble breaking through the HUGE claws or other parts of the crab, you can put them on a plate and ask the server to have the kitchen break them for you! You don't want any going to waste :)"

We were seated quite quickly due to our reservation, and it was outside the restaurant closer to the water. I didn't really like our table because it was pretty close to where everybody goes to smoke so I occasionally had the odor of cigarette smoke while eating, but it wasn't too bad.The Chili crab and satays were very good, but the black pepper crab was too peppery.The cereal prawns had a lot of cereal but not too much prawn. The fish in banana leaf was decent. Overall it was pretty decent but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."

The east coast branch is by far the most popular on the island. I am guessing it's because of its complimentary location near the sea adds to one's seafood dining experience. It's super crowded on weekend evenings. Do not attempt to go without a booking, especially if it is a public holiday weekend. Overall, Jumbo doesn't disappoint. It serves quality seafood amidst a casual and family-friendly environment. Singaporean families (across generations - think aunty, uncle, cousins...) gather here for good seafood. Food: 1. Pepper crab - Awesome! Get your bibs ready! It can get messy. 2. Chili crab sauce & man tou - I LOVE their man tous (fried buns). It's fried to golden perfection! Crispy on the outside but soft & smooth on the inside. I could eat a plate of these (they are pretty small in size), especially dipped in chili sauce. TIP: you can order the chili crab sauce without having to order the whole crab itself. So you can have your crab in another sauce (black pepper) and still get to enjoy the wholesome goodness of dipping your man tous in the chili sauce. Double happiness. 3. Fried you tiao - LOVE! These are fried doughs stuffed with fish paste. It may sound strange to foreigners but they are heavenly. A must-try for sure. 4. Mee goreng - Good. A little spicy though. Be warned. 5. Mix vegetable & mushrooms - Good. The mushrooms were so fresh. 6. Steam prawns with egg - LOVE! The prawn was so fresh & sweet. It comes served with a sweet black sauce which goes so well with the prawns. I could eat this all day. Service: - Very efficient!"

The one on the East Cost is the best (IMHO). There is nothing fancy about this restaurant.  Come to sit by the ocean on uncomfortable plastic chairs, enjoy some cold beer, and devour as many crabs as you can.  The awesome Jumbo experience is very simple and consists of only five elements, so anyone can execute this plan.  Here it is:1) Sit outside, not inside2) Order beer, and then keep ordering it throughout the meal (you'll see why shortly)3) Order lots of Chili Crabs4) Order a ton of Man-tou buns (fried, not steamed).5) After you are done with the first 4 things, order Sago for dessert (even if the waitstaff gives you a hard time about it).I believe Chili Crab may be one of nature's most perfect food substances.  The crab is huge, meaty, and sweet.  The sauce is beyond compare - rich, tangy, and oh so spicy.  And extra good when you sop it up with the Man-tou (kind of like little savory doughnuts).  Lot's of fried spicy goodness there.  Order double the number of buns they suggest - I seem to prefer a higher bun to sauce ratio then is standard.I see many reviewers indicate you should go with Black Pepper Crab.  While that is a fine dish, I've always preferred the sauciness of Chili Crab.  But try them both - you can't go wrong.  Also, remember to wear clothes that can get soiled.  Those crabs are messy, but that is half the fun.Finally, let me put in a word for Sago.  It's kind of like cold sweetened coconut soup with melon balls and ice shavings.  Delicious, refreshing, and the perfect antidote to your burning lips from the yummy Chili Crab.  My Father almost passed out from delight the first time he had Sago here.In short, when I next make the long, long, long trip from Chicago to Singapore I will be heading to Jumbo."

Not because of the food, no, no, but because of how messy you will get eating the delicious, drool inducing chili crab. This is some of the best stuff on earth. Seriously. If you come here for nothing else you will be quite happy. The crab is really fresh and the sauce is just so he right amount of spicy. It's very messy and finger lickin good. We also had the cereal prawn that was just a bit too sweet, it tastes very similar to coconut shrimp and also the yam covered scallops. They were also very good. You obviously have to have beer with your chili crab so make sure to grab a pitcher of tiger. This is the third or fourth time here from America, I will always come back here to eat. I love it so much. I'll be coming here for years to come. I wish they sold the chili sauce by the gallon. I would just drink it."

In California we have different types of crab so was almost positive it would not turn out the same :( It's also really good if you dip your bread into the chili sauce!

Perfect blend of a spicy and sweetness of a crabBoiled live shrimp comes in a wine soup - get about 3 per person.Chicken/Beef kabobs- tastes good if you dip it in their peanut sauce!Malaysia dry noodle- reminded me to be similar to a spaghetti with seafood in it. Mango- not sure if its the right season or if its just always good- but the mango is soft and sweet! perfect way to end your meal.Ate a lot more- but can't remember the names.

Order some fried buns (mantou) to soak up some of that delicious chilli sauce, and you've got a fantastic meal. It gets pricey, but it's worth it. A few tips for those non-natives ( that I learned the hard way): there are no napkins. How you're expected to eat this crab with no provided napkins is beyond me, but that's how it's done in SG. Stop by a convenience store and pick up a multi-pack of tissues, since that's what everyone uses for napkins. The restaurant provides you with a finger bowl to rinse your hands while eating.

Order a few of the fried mantou (buns) on the side, and get ready to soak up all that saucy goodness! (Trust me, you'll need more mantou than you think!)  For what you pay (about $55 a kg) it's pricey.  A crab will be anywhere between $50-80, and it's not a whole lot of food, but hey, when in Singapore...The cereal prawn ($20 or so) is also really good, make sure you order it with the shell off. Breaded in a slightly sweet and crunchy cereal breading, it's well worth a try.And don't be afraid of wearing the bib for the crab (ask for it if they don't offer), even the locals do it!"

I heard Singapore is known for their spicy crabs so of course we had to go somewhere really authentic to get it. This restaurant has a really nice bay view but it was raining that day so we couldn't sit outside to enjoy the scene. So the food. There was 13 of us and we ordered what seemed like everything on the menu so that we can try a little of everything. We got the spicy crab and the peppered crab which I guess for a non-seafood eater was pretty decent although I still wouldn't go out of my way to eat crab. My family really enjoyed it since they are seafood lovers. I do have to agree that it's probably the most flavorful crab I've ever tasted. To be honest, what I loved most about the meal was the little buns that came with the crabs. It really was just white dough with a little sugar but it was so soft and chewy and I think I probably had ten pieces all by myself. It was an overall good meal but because I don't really like seafood, I probably don't have the best judgment. One little boo boo was that they messed up our dessert and gave us a 13 people portion instead of a single serving like we asked and ended up just not giving us anything in the end after we waited for it foreverrrr. The service wasn't great but I guess we were a pretty loud annoying group with two babies that anyone would find hard to deal with."

The staff were friendly, accomadating and spoke ok English. The line of sushi chefs wore gloves and mouth guards. They cranked out an endless line of sushi and other items. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all very tasty. The portions were on the small side, but the prices were reasonable (s$2-9) on most things, so we were able to have a wider variety of items.We loved that besides soy sauce, each table had a supply of wasabi and pickled ginger."

The broth is rich in flavour and explodes in your mouth. The uncle even makes it an emphasis (a sign) that he doesn't re-fill the soup as it would dilute the flavours. Wow, that's quality.

He gives 3 pieces of prawn and slices of lean pork meat along with a regular bowl, and nothing to complain.

As soon as I saw it, I had to have it. I'm obsessed with Sushirrito in the Bay Area and always order a sushi burrito when it's available. I was excited at first to see they had very similar rolls like Salmon Samba and Geishas Kiss, though under different names. I should have been deterred by the first reviewer, but I did not heed those wise words, and my excitement diminished when I realized they wouldn't make me a fresh sushi burrito. All the rolls are displayed as halves, so I thought maybe if I ordered a full roll they'd make me new one (nope, just two halves). And of course, it tasted like it's been sitting around for a while. Sushirrito tells you it's best enjoyed immediately, and I think that's true with any sushi burrito. Moist seaweed just doesn't stay good for long. Overall, not terrible, but not worth it."

The sushi burrito is alright. I've had better and would not recommend this. They have a display of their various sushi burrito options on the window for you to choose from. You can either get a half burrito or full burrito. The rice was bland and the veggies tasted old (not fresh). I  got the rainbow shrimp burrito, which consisted of prawn tempura. However the prawn tempura was mushy and soft on the outside. You can tell that the burrito had been sitting out for a while and not fresh.

Sushi burrito is basically like an uncut sushi roll with more ingredients. While that can sound attractive because hei, who doesn't like sushi?, but Sushi Burrito did it completely all wrong. I tried their unagi sushi burrito. The amount of unagi is like the amount you would get on 4 pieces of unagi sushi while the rice and fillers would make maybe 4 sets of sushi roll (4 x 6/8 of your regular sushi!). What are the fillers? Cucumbers, pickled veggies, onions and LOTS of rice. If I want my veggies, I would go get myself a bowl of salad. Lots of veggies maybe good for you but I paid to get a meal where I can taste unagi in most of my bites. Nope. It was mostly rice and veggies. For the price, I would not recommend this place. On the good side, their packaging is very handy for a quick grab and it is a healthy option."

But i began to remove those thought as soon as I had my second bite. They are different. It taste so good and still fresh although i doubt it when i arrive at the stall and looking at those sushiburrito that already displayed. They just took those premade sushi and served it. Although it is still good, i wish they can make it fresh. Idk how it works for people who order half size. Maybe they will make the fresh version of that? Perhaps. So i just want to conclude my review that Sushi Burrito is a better version of handroll sushi that i usually have. It taste better than normal sushi or hand roll. It has good appearance. But perhaps, maybe more experimental flavor/sauce in the future. Note: the wasabi burned me"

It is not too far from the Kembangan MRT and you could probably see the signboard from afar.Came here as Mel had purchased 2 Sugar coupons for the waffles and we decided to try the waffles with Hokkaido Milk & Honey and Figs . We also ordered the B.F.F. 4 types of fries and four types of sauces. The waffle was over-crispy but the ice creams were delicious. It was melting on the tongue after putting it in your mouth. Didn't really like the waffle that much as this time round it was over-cooked.The B.F.F. was interesting mix of fries. I like the truffle fries as it was crunchy but it doesn't have much truffle flavor on it. The wedges and the criss-cut fries were al-right (probably cause I've been eating too much other stuffs before coming here). I didn't try the shoestring fries (Curly fries?). The dips I have no clue what they are besides the tartar sauce.This place is rather cosy and inviting. On the walls it has writings and interesting quotes. Was not as crowded as I thought it maybe especially on a Saturday evening. Definitely a good place to hang out or even board game sessions :)

From what I understand it has opened for over a year now and I have just learnt about this place via the SUGAR app. It is within walking distance of Kembangan MRT. We managed to easily find a parallel parking street parking spot along Changi Road.1. Rack o' Ribs ($22.80)The great BBQ aroma from this dish would make anyone hungry! It was slighly charred to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. For Singapore standards it's pretty good, still nowhere near what I used to eat daily in the States. For $22.80 it's not too pricey, although that's as much as I would ever pay for ribs in Singapore.The meat was juicy and tender. The ribs were well executed with the barbecue sauce over nicely done meat.2. Waffles with Ice Cream ($5.80 each)With the SUGAR app, we managed to buy each waffle with ice cream for about $2 each! But nonetheless even at $5.80 It's still quite reasonable, compared to some cafes that charge like $9 for a whole waffle and ice cream. This is indeed only half a waffle but there's so much to love about this waffle.The waffle is delightfully crispy! It is not the fluffy kind, some online reviewers have mentioned that it tastes like over-cooked waffles or even ""burnt"". But to me, it was nice and crispy and I like it this way. The chocolate ice cream was a bit bitter, the green tea ice cream was nice and had the legit green tea taste in there. The salted caramel was the sweet ice cream amongst the 3 flavours. The waffle was slightly salty, some of my friends didn't like it so salty, but I felt that it was a good compliment for the salted caramel ice cream, since the ice cream was so sweet. Waffles and ice cream! Who can resist such a great combination of colours and flavours.The food at Rice & Fries may not be super awesome , it's nevertheless tasty and the ambience is very enjoyable.

The taste was very savory and the crust was thin and crispy. I personally like the crust to be thin, and pizzas with crusts that are overly thick and floury turn me off.We also had a few other pizzas such as the triple meat pizza and the pepperoni pizza, which were all good but no doubt, the pizza to try here is the seafood pizza.

The charred fatty cuts of meat are pretty much amazing, and I'm partial to the roast pork and roast chicken. It's also reasonably priced, at around S$4-6 for a packet of chicken rice. Ask for the dark meat (chicken thigh) instead of the leaner cuts. Trust me, it's worth the calories.The stall is located within the coffeeshop named ""Keng Bee Restaurant"" at the corner of the building facing the Caltex gas station. Seating within the coffeeshop is limited and there's parking at the back. The line is out the door pretty much at lunchtime, so do come early before they sell out.Depending on how long the line is, the guy at the stall might get a little grouchy or impatient with you. I also have to knock them for a less than stellar chilli sauce which is practically watered down beyond recognition.The stall is closed on Tuesdays, and a different hawker helms the evening shift at the same stall, so be aware that the food served might be different at dinner.TLDR; Old school roast chicken and roast pork with charred fatty cuts, reasonably priced but a bad attitude with a long wait.

It's got three layers of heaven: (i) juicy inside, (ii) marbled fatty area  and (iii) a crunchy skin.

Word of Advice: To best enjoy the roast pork, DO NOT put any sauce on top. It will dilute the flavor. However, be sure to ask the uncle to put sauce on top of the rice. The separation of rice with sauce and the roast pork is just a perfect complement.  Lines are obviously long, Locals already know this little secret.

So I got a plate of char siew + siew yoke rice, and sat down to wolf it down.Fate intervened of course, and uncle had generously slapped on my plate some rough cut meats, liberally marbled with soft, juicy fat. As I took a second to admire his handiwork before shovelling it into my now ravenous mouth-hole, I realised the beauty in what lay before me - the rough cut meant he did not stinge on razor-thin slivers, and the chunkier segments offered more bite and flavour, so I could really experience the char in his char siew.Though I did savour each tasty morsel, it was gone too soon, and all I had left was the simple soup to end what was a very tasty meal for just three dollars.

To upsize your steak, pay $5 extra.By all means it's not the best steak, you get what you pay for, really. Beef quality is only a small notch above Aston's or Jack's place. Fries are crispy out of the fryer, and for the salad, you get butter lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce. If you're in the mood, they do serve caipirinhas. :)4 stars cos it's value for money, but don't come in here expecting Morton's or Ruth's Chris.

The best deal on the menu is easily the signature Meat (you are getting the steak, no questions asked) served with an UNLIMITED supply of French fries and fresh lettuce.  P.S I wish they replaced the French fries with rice, kidding! Clearly, this is not an Asian restaurant :-)For doneness of my meat, I chose medium-rare. The rib eye steak came out fantastic. I had no idea the French could grill! You also have the option of three sauces: mango, mustard and chipotle to mix with your steak and fries. Don't fret, if there is no seating space on the first floor. There is a large 2nd floor with another set of 8 dinning tables or more. it's a bit neat to see expats living in the neighborhood playing a card game of sorts on the second floor during the evening. The big surprise is that there is a beautiful terrace in the back that accommodates 20 or more people, if you are keen for a fun night amongst friends under neath the stars and in an enclosed outdoor setting.Four stars for the price - $20 for char grilled steak and unlimited homemade fries and the fact you won't find this type of restaurant anywhere else on Joo Chiat or anywhere else on the East Coast for that matter."

The decor certainly is very impressive with books neatly arranged from wall to wall and old phones decorated at various locations. The ambience is great for catch up with friends over a drink. We've ordered our main courses all from the promo menu and truffle Parmesan fries. It took close to 20 mins before the fries arrived followed by pasta and burger. The Pork neck grill took another 10 mins to be delivered. Sadly, the burger and the Pork neck was more salty than needed while the pasta is blend. We are more sad that with all the truffle shavings on the pasta and pork neck, we can't smell the truffles. Which is very unusual as this is not the first time we've had truffle dishes. Even with the promotion, each dish is about $28. And for that price, I don't see the value when I have the 3 small pieces of pork neck done like schnitzels, topped with creamy sauce and potato chips that occupied half of the plate. We couldn't finish our food because I get tired chewing the pork neck and the pasta was too blend to warrant anymore consumption. The saving grace is the burger because it's not too big and, the parmesan fries has a very nice truffle mayo dip.

We ordered Eggs Benedict with portobello & Parmesan crisps and Smashed Avocado with Smoked salmon with Matcha latte & orange juice. While Matcha & juice was tasty & fresh, the food was bland.

It did look like it had a nice brunch menu, and their burger offerings for dinner looked quite nice. At around 6:30 PM however, they shut off most of the lights, which I think was a real mood killer. No need to have lighting resembling that of a sketchy club, when you are in a nice café where people want to go to talk each other, and in fact, see each other too."

And while the oysters on offer certainly are fresh and yummy and great value during happy hour (5pm-7pm) or all-night on Mondays... the real food. The proper food. The cooked food. Oh how brilliant it is.It's all small sharing plates, and the menu says order quite a few dishes for just two, but frankly we find that's a little generous. For groups of 4-5, between 8-12 dishes is more than plenty. What's good? Almost everything. Twice I've been and twice I've ordered all the garden dishes. The Brussel Sprouts are to die for. When you pick up everything on the plate you get salty-sweet-charred-heat all in a mouthful. The cabbage too. The burrata has been on fleek each time I've ordered it, and the Snow Crab and Manila Clams have me wiping the dish clean with the awesome bread each. And. Every. Time. I'd give the fish dishes a miss, I tried the tuna, the rainbow trout, and the ceviche and all weren't as impressive as the other offerings. For proteins I like the chicken more than the beef or pork. It's a well-crafted dish... though companions liked the beef very much. The pork was kinda meh. And definitely have desserts. There're only two but both are good solid sweets than really hit the spot. I prefer the panna cotta because it's not as sweet or rich as the chocolate mousse, but if you like a good mousse, this is as good as you'll find anywhere. ANYWHERE. IN THE WORLD. So... y'know.

There is a choice of outdoor seating but it is prohibitively hot in Singapore sometimes. I made an online booking via a third party website for 5 people on a Monday for 8pm a week in advance, and was surprised that there weren't any tables for 7pm ish. Steffi C and I arrived early, at 730pm and surprise, our table wasn't ready, and we sat outside. We ordered a few oysters but they only came 20 minutes after, when our table was nearly ready. We tried to hurry this Eurasian-looking server for our table but he was sort of... curt. Never mind.The fuss about Mondays at Humpback is because oysters are half price here, all-night. They do have half-priced oysters everyday, but only from 5-7pm, which most working people cannot come on time. You might want to avoid Mondays if you want half-priced oysters and have 5-7pm on another day free.They have a comprehensive cocktail menu, but I prefer my cocktails orders to be taken by a bartender and customized to my preference. We opted for a Riesling on our very nice server's recommendation.Because we were a party of 5, we got a few small plates to share, apart from the oysters. We had the burrata (yum!), gruyere and feta tapioca balls (yum!), brussel sprouts (I felt it was undercooked but my friends liked it crunchy), pork (too pink for my liking), wagyu (not bad), calamari (yum), tuna (we didn't realize it was raw, 3.5/5). The oysters were fresh, sweet, and nobody had the runs after. Not all varieties of oysters were available, as they source whatever is available direct from Washington state, US. I do love my PNW seafood. My peeve about the oysters were that for more than 20 oysters, they had a tiny pot of vinaigrette. Passing the little jar around was quite annoying.The unexpected star of the meal was the chocolate mousse. I will be sure to order my own portion next time I come here. Bill came up to about 75 per person, but we had wine and oysters and many many plates to share. I imagine it would be more expensive on a non-Monday. Book your seats!"

Until the day that I found out about this place through Natalie H. ""Oysterssssssssss"" was all she said, and I was in. The $2-$3 oysters (5-7pm on weekdays+saturday, all day on mondays) drew me to this place, but what really made me like it were the sides that we got. They're the guys behind Sugarhall in Telok Ayer too, which also has excellent sides, and I wasn't disappointed here.I really cannot find another bad to say about the sides we got. Well ok the pork was a bit pink, not sure if that was on purpose but I did recall someone at work (I'm in healthcare) telling me that you should NEVER eat raw pork and hence my fork stayed far away from THAT dish. Otherwise, the burrata, feta tapioca balls, wagyu, calamari, brussel sprouts and tuna were all excellent. I think I might come back just for the sides next time. The sides were bigger than I expected, enough for each person in a group of 5 to get a taster portion and just a bit more.Service was... well they were really crowded and busy on a monday and MAYBE there was just one poor guy shucking oysters because that's the only reason I think of to explain why the oysters took so long to come?I'll still come back though.

I've tried their competitor before and was looking forward to how good the impossible patty really was and it did not disappoint! Impossible Chedda ($23.00)This was such a delight to have. It still baffles me how they managed to get it looking, tasting and feeling so much like meat when it's all plant based. The only thing is, I wished the added less ketchup. It did feel like they were trying to mask whatever non-meatiness there was but having tasted the patty on its own, I think it would have handled itself just fine. The other parts of the burger was great too. The brioche bun was beautifully toasted yet remained soft and fluffy while the onion purée & pickles gave it an extra lift. Overall a fantastic burger Burning Rice ($18.00) The burning rice was pretty interesting too. A great option for friends who need something more asian while bearding to a burger joint. The rice had a good spice added to it and it's interesting that they serve it with a burger patty. Be warned though, it's a pretty big bowl of carbs!Sticky Icky Wicky ($7.00)Finally! A sticky date pudding done right. Too many times I've ordered a sticky date pudding or sticky toffee pudding in Singapore and it was a let down. This on the other when an absolute delight to have. It's warm, sticky, sweet, yummy. The kind of dessert that warms your heart and soul while you swallow it. Contrast that with the ice cold ice cream it's served with and it was absolutely yummy. Overall, we loved the place. The food we tried were really good and I will definitely be back. And yes, for the Impossible Burger."

My favorite was the BBQ Bacon burger, although the regular and chicken were also delicious. We ventured up to the very buys rooftop bar on the 3rd floor which had nice views of the city.

The food (mostly burgers) on level 2 (Three Buns) was good but not worth the price. I shared the Smoking B-Boy which was 150gm of beef patty with bacon and cheese and fried shallots (bawang goreng). The fried shallot was nice, gave a different dimension to the beef. For $28++, you just get a burger and nothing else. No sides or anything. I had a lemonade jerk which came with slices of grapefruit and lemon. It was fizzy and not too sweet. I could taste the slight bitterness of the grapefruit. I tried the sticky date pudding which was not bad but came in a tiny container. I nicked a bit of the ""chili fries"" which was also not too bad. The food is generally ok, but the service could be better or flexible. To be fair, it was only one wait staff who was that. The others were quite lovely. I was taken aback when the said wait staff flatly refused to do individual billing even before we ordered especially when we were a big group. Many eateries have started doing individual billing as it just made it easier for everyone instead of wasting time trying to figure out the cost. I have also been to places when they can spilt the bill even when it was just 2 persons dining. They need to play catch up in this aspect. The same wait staff was also very adamant about us hurrying up (close to 30 minutes of our arrival and we were settling in and looking at the menu, taking pictures and just trying to decide on what to order) in placing our order and telling us we need to vacate in an hour time. Again we were stunned. Never have I been to a place where the staff would actually say that. Usually if there is a time limit on the table, they would inform us once we got seated. Not after 30 minutes and then saying we have one hour to place order and eat. Thank goodness our efficient organizer kept the email reservation where it clearly stated our timing. It was for 2 hours, and if the kitchen cannot handle big group orders, then maybe they should not impose a time limit in the first place. And the place was fairly empty when we were there, definitely not full house with a line waiting outside. Another wait staff spilled my drink (too generous and filled to the brim) on me and my cloth bag (my ipad is inside!) but he was so apologetic and concerned that I just waved it off. And thank goodness it was a cloth bag so it was totally washable. I am not sure if I will return as the burgers were not spectacular (I would rather go to Roadhouse or &made or DB Bistro) and that antsy eager beaver wait staff certainly marred the experience in wanting us to just order, eat and go."

NOTE: Honky-Tonk was the only chicken burger on the menu, can't speak for the other burgers.We were sitting on the 2nd floor and the place looked nice until the sun went down and it became dark. Would have been a better place to have lunch at instead of dinner in my opinion. We also had to wait 45 mins for our dessert. We were told that the kitchen was busy and that it took awhile to warm the pudding. This would have been okay if the pudding arrived steaming hot which was not the case. Plus, my friend's reservation to the 3rd floor lounge had to be released to someone else as we were still waiting for the dessert. Overall, in my opinion it is overrated and not worth the money.

I like the multi-level venue that offers a different experience depending on the mood you're in.On the bottom, it's a casual outdoor spot where you can take away a burger or scoff it there and then. Past the charming door hosts and up the quirky stairwell painted by Melbourne artist David Bromley, you'll come to the dining area where Burgers and fun pre-mixed cocktails are the order of the day. The staff here are delightful, making recommendations and having a bit of fun with customers. I love their colourful shirts and great attitudes. The burger I tried was pretty bloody delicious, though a little soggy on the bottom by the time I got through eating it. Next time I'd skip the sauces as not only do they create the soggy bun, but they add unnecessary sweetness for this savoury lover.One level up and behind a big black door is a colonial feeling cocktail lounge. Here it's about serious cocktails, both the old school and the modern classics as well as some Potato Head creations. I settled on a Martini and loved the glassware and the delightful handkerchief-like placemat it was sat on. If downstairs is for the young at heart, this space is for proper grown ups... or those of us who like to at least pretend we are.Up one more level and there's a rooftop bar. We didn't experience this as it was a scorching day and I felt as if my face might melt off. On a cool evening, this might just be the pick of the bunch. Guess I'll just have to make another visit, right?"

I'd picked this place as it promised good food in an interesting location, and the decors (designed by some Australian guy with a fear of flying...) had been much hyped about.Good things first: The decor was really quite impressive. We were seated at the Three Buns restaurant (second floor) and blue floral designs decorated the walls with artfully mismatched furniture and quirky statues, lending a whimsical vibe to the area. Most guests are seated in comfy-looking couches surrounding low tables, but our group of 14 got the large communal dining table in the middle of the room. The stairwell featured checkered tiles and more interesting statues/paintings, and the bar on the third floor reminded me of a 1900s Gentleman's bar- dark woods, heavy furniture, the most amazing collection of liquor in bottles of every kind. It was amazing and one could really appreciate the planning put into the design of this place.HOWEVER, the food was just ok. Yes, this is a burger joint, but we were a bit disappointed that they didn't really have any decent alternatives for those who were craving something else. I mean, usually there would be at least 2 sides which could pass off as a decent meal on its own? But anyway, most of us tried the Baby Huey (beef patty), Honky Tonk (chicken), 4 stories (double beef patty)... The verdict was that the Honky Tonk was the best due to the excellent pairing of the buttermilk chicken fillet and tangy coleslaw. We tried the Naughty Fries (potato spuds with salsa and a hell lot of parsley) and Sticky Date pudding too. My fries were alright, luckily not as bad as the one that Natalie had. The Sticky Date pudding was good but the portion was TINY for $8.Bad things last: The service was pushy and hurried. We had a reservation from 1230-1430, and while we did take SOME time to order, there was this guy who kept on rushing us and telling us that we had to get out by 2pm... He must have said it at least 4 times in 10 minutes. (Turned out that they got the timing wrong, we left before 1430 anyway) Yes, I know that you're popular, yes, I know that you have tables to turn, but it could have been conveyed in a less authoritative tone. I'm not sure if they even apologised after we informed them that they had gotten the end-time of our reservation wrong.Would I come back? Maybe... But a return visit isn't near the top of my agenda now."

It's a cool place. But on the two occasions I went there, I found myself being pretty disappointed with the food. Overall all I can say was that the food was nothing special. It was not terrible but not quite worth the 20+++ price tag for a burger. The homemade cola and all were pretty undrinkable to most of us who ordered it. The service was bleh as well. I ain't gonna say much about this because I used to work in F&B and understand how it gets on the flip side. But bleh. Could be much better overall. It's alright.

I was bummed because it's such a lovely looking place. So I gave it a chance and asked if I could change my drink because I absolutely hated this dishwater. The server refused saying it was just probably not to my liking and they couldn't help if I don't like it. They would however add more yuzu syrup to make it taste better. I appreciated that gesture but I did not appreciate her reasoning. Some people sitting next to me overheard our conversation and told me this happened to them earlier too and they were told nothing could be done. So they left most of their drinks untouched. What a pity. Everyone just writes it off as bad customer service in Singapore. But I say, it's a top down issue.

Left me needing a huge bottle of ice water to wash down the taste.Honkey Tonk ($18) - the chicken was done impeccably well. Was crisp, tender and moist. Again, the bun was just a filler. Personally, not a fan of chicken burgers but the execution of this was pretty good. Likely to go back for this one.Finished off with a Sticky Icky Wicky ($8) - was moist and was not too sweet.

The entire Duxton Hill area has a nice vibe to it and I loved the setting of the entire place. However, the service was really bad. From the girl at the counter who was in an extremely sour mood, to our server who cold shouldered us the whole night."

The price was exorbitant considering the burger tasted mediocre (nothing special). It had a lovely sauce on in, but just felt that for the price we were paying it should have been bigger or at least come with a side. NOTE: Honky-Tonk was the only chicken burger on the menu, can't speak for the other burgers.We were sitting on the 2nd floor and the place looked nice until the sun went down and it became dark. Would have been a better place to have lunch at instead of dinner in my opinion. We also had to wait 45 mins for our dessert. We were told that the kitchen was busy and that it took awhile to warm the pudding. This would have been okay if the pudding arrived steaming hot which was not the case. Plus, my friend's reservation to the 3rd floor lounge had to be released to someone else as we were still waiting for the dessert. Overall, in my opinion it is overrated and not worth the money. If you are coming for the ambience try coming at in the afternoon or for a early dinner and if you're lucky you would snag a seat at the rooftop bar too."

After so much talk about Potato Head, I've managed to pull a decent excuse off my exercise regimen to come savour the burgers here.... and fries *ahem*.My friend and I came on a Sunday evening, and the good thing is that the place was not crowded; it was easy enough to get a seat. The problem is that it is located in Keong Saik, which means parking is always a problem. Hence, you can get a seat, but most of the time you're not gonna find parking.Tried: Rambo and the Burning Man burgers. They are very delicious, although I wish they were bigger. The buns are baked from whole meal, making this a little more healthy compared to the sin I'll be ingesting.- The Rambo burger is mutton/lamb, which they managed to mask over the gamey taste with lots of spices and I believe... a blue-cheese kinda sauce? I might be wrong, but it sure tasted like it. The combination of the sauces and spices sure gave it a pretty unique taste.- The Burning Man, now we're talking. A nice slice of beef patty well grilled with mayo and ketchup, topped with Californian jalapenos to spice up the taste. It was good. However, the burning man's jalapenos has some serious zing into it, which was fine for me but not for my friend... you have been warned!- Also tried the Naughty Fries, which are basically fresh but soggy potato chips slathered with a generous dashing of cheese sauce and beef chili (the Mexican kind). It literally was one of the best cheese fries I had so far.Rants: Wish the burgers could be bigger. The sizes of these burgers remind me of what you can get from MacDonald's (no not the big mac). That's the reason why I had two burgers instead of just one. And the prices of each burger is kind of expensive ranging in the $20s, without any side dishes or fries or salads etc.. Burgers are tasty, but the pricing still leaves a bitter taste. You have been warned!Raves: The whimsical theme of the décor leaves a nice chill-out location if you're into these kind of things.

Its super instagramable. I had pretty high expectations but after I saw the menu things changed. The food here is super expensive. Like 25 dollars for a burger the size of my fist. My sister ordered the burger and I was so shocked at how small it was.  It was literally a slider size.  I ordered the wings, which were meant to be appetizers but I got them as my meal. They weren't your average buffalo wings. The sauce on the outside was a spicy sweet chili sauce and there were spring onions and deep fried onions as garnishes. The outside was crispy and the flavor was unique.  They were probably the cheapest thing on the menu so I was actually pretty satisfied with my meal. The rest of the people that I went with got burgers and I felt so bad for them because of how much money they had spent on the smallest burger ever. Go here for average burgers if you don't mind over paying for them."

So I called in to make a reservation, but an automated voice answering machine told me I would receive a text message to complete the reservation, which I did. It was a short URL to make a reservation via Chope. However on Chope, I could only select a maximum party size of 6. So in the comments I asked for 2 more seats.A few hours later I got a call saying that their cafe's reservation policy requires each person to spend at least $25 and order a main course. Waffles which are priced $18.50+ with 2 scoops of ice cream are not considered a main course. Even the staff encouraged me to walk in. This is ridiculous. So we decided to walk in, and the food better be worth the effort!Despite the phone call, I was delighted to be greeted by the beautiful ice cream display!And I pinched myself to be sure I wasn't dreaming when I saw the $23 per pint price tag. Okay, let's see if their ice cream is really twice as good as other competitors, to be priced this high.The interior has a very homely, retro feel to it, the lighting isn't instagram's best friend. You will have to improvise or try and get a table by the windows.1. Beef Bolognese Cheese Fries $15+With truffle tries price at $14, we decided to try something else. Sadly, this dish wasn't what we expected, even though there is supposedly cheese in the sauce. We couldn't taste any. It was a plate of very soggy fries, with a very under seasoned beef bolognese sauce.2. Squid Ink Risotto $25+Tasted cheesy and I felt gerlat very quickly. This is the first plate of Risotto that I didn't like, I am normally a huge fan of Risotto.It's waffle time! Despite the unsatisfying experience with the main courses, I was so certain the highly instagrammable waffles with ice cream would be the highlight of my night!3. Waffles with Mao shan wang durian and belgian chocolate $18.50+I liked that the durian ice cream colour wasn't overly yellow, which a lot of ice cream parlours, normally add yellow colouring to, it didn't smell very fragrant but it tasted good. I liked the durian ice cream. The Belgian chocolate tasted okay, it didn't leave an impression for me. The waffles, which I was looking forward to, tasted ok, I've definitely had better waffles in the surrounding area.4. Waffles with Pulut Hitam and Pistacchio $18.50+The only redeeming factor that Chatper 55 had for me tonight, was the Pulut Hitam ice cream, which I truly enjoyed. However not all the girls at my table liked it. It wasn't displayed, but they had it in the freezer. You could bite into the black rice bits in the ice cream. It a legit, pulut hitam ice cream! The Pistacchio was also a memorable ice cream flavour. You can distinctively taste the pistacchio.The bill for 6 girls and we weren't very big eaters, so asking all 6 of us to order a main course each isn't the wisest cafe policy, even from a business stand point.The staff weren't well organized and took a long while to clear our table. The first staff cleared one plate, and a male staff cleard 2 more plates. We were done with all our plates and when the waffles came, we still had half a table worth of dirty plates. Only after the second waffle came to our table, did another male staff who served us the waffles, clear the rest of the dirty dishes.The chinese local lady at the cashier who spoke mandarin was very friendly and polite. I had higher hopes for their ice cream and waffles with such a high price tag on each plate. On the bright side, they have BOGO weekday lunch offers.wifi password : chapter55"

So today, despite the heavy afternoon rain, we walked from our office to sought out the place. Walking along Eng Hoon Street, the restaurant was easily noticeable by the corner of Tiong Poh Road. It's pretty big. One thing that I found very attractive on their signboard was how they highlighted their ""1 for 1 on weekdays"" offer.We went as a group of 5. Seeing that the restaurant is not Halal-certified, I couldn't try out their main courses, hence I went with the desserts. Like one of the popular quotes that I snapped stated, ""Life is short. Eat dessert first!""The appetizers came as bowls of mushroom soup. The mushrooms weren't in chunky forms but they were grounded in, which was nice!Two of my colleagues ordered one plate of white wine pasta (Vongole?) and the other, some sort of seafood pasta. Can't recall the names of the dishes, but both of them commented that the spices in both of their pastas were too overpowering; one even masked the white wine sauce. They also ordered buffalo wings (5 pieces). Personally, from what I see, those wings were overpriced. Such small pieces for $16?!Came my Salted Caramel Waffle and a glass of Black Cow. Funny names to give the floats: ""Black Cow"" for Coke Float and ""Snow White"" for Sprite Float. Well, as you can see from my waffle photo, I just loved the presentation. What a plating! Loved how they stenciled in cocoa powder of their logo at the corner of the plate. The waffle itself cost me $17 due to the fact that I opted for 2 scoops of ice-cream. Otherwise it would have been $15 for one. I opted for a scoop of Salted Caramel and Hazelnut gelato on my waffle, while I got another scoop of Hersheys gelato for my coke float. Loved the waffle!We even sampled a teaspoon of some of the gelatos on display. I had the Salted Egg flavoured, Cotton Candy flavoured and Strawberry Cheesecake flavoured... Nice. But definitely, I have tasted better and creamier gelatos elsewhere."

We ordered buffalo wings to share, I remember it being decent but not particularly authentic but on the spicy side.  The dish that blew me away was one of their fresh pasta dishes. The sauce was AMAZING, it is very flavorful and seems to be saffron based.  The seafood was very fresh, which is quite a rarity when eating out and reflects their attentiveness in sourcing ingredients.  It is also very reasonably priced.  To be honest, it was really out of my expectations.  I later read from other reviews that the chef is from Pasta Brava - that explains it.  Also read that its owner is the same as Ice Edge Cafe, a popular cafe in Kovan (ok too far for me so good they open one in TB). I tried a piece of the pizza that my friend was having, the crust was pretty good too.  The pasta was really filling as the sauce was so rich, so I didn't have any room for desserts.   That is a pity though as they appears to serve a great selection of gelatos.   I read that they have a 1-for-1 pasta deal during weekday lunch time and that's a pretty good deal, I would totally take advantage of this if I work around Tiong Bahru.  This is a pretty big space and can accommodate any group dining comfortably."

I don't see where it's 'hip' or 'ster'.Food is average. Mushroom soup is not Campbell's. Or at least to my un-hipster taste buds. Buffalo wings were like sweet and sour chicken wings, not spicy. Pasta was meh. The only thing I would come back for are the pizzas, Super thin crust and light. Nice.Ambience is homely. Lots of wood benches and tin pails for decoration. Seats are tightly packed and walk space is narrow. I might have seen a mason jar or two. /shudder""Will I come back?"" Yes, for the pizza and for the ""buy 1 get one free"" lunch special. Now the mechanics of this BOGO is dreadfully complicated and very sneaky if the customer is not careful. I will explain this in the next section. This would have been so easy to fix when asked, and would have won a life-long customer. But. hey, which restaurant manager would want to do that?Service is non-existent. Poor guys are overworked and do not have time for pleasantries. Price. Ahhh, the only thing this place has going for it is the 1 for 1 lunch special. When you get seated, you will see from the menu that not all items qualify for this. Items that do, have a little label next to it.So! Imagine the following scenario:Ah Beng and Ah Lian decide to try this new 'simi-lai eh hipster' cafe near Ah Mah's flat in Tiong Bahru.They order two muchroom soups ($11 for 2) This items is automatically 1 for 1. Don't know why they have to make life so confusing.Then Ah Beng orders a Vogole pasta MAIN for $18. Ah Lian orders a Funghi Pizza for $18.For appetisers, Ah Beng orders Buffalo Wings ($16) and Ah Lian orders Calamari Rings ($16).So, quick recap: 2 soups, 2 mains, 2 appetisers.QUESTION: How much was Ah Beng and Ah Lian charged for their lunch? (Assume no service charge.)ANSWER: You would think, this is easy! 1 for 1 mushroom soup + 1 for 1 MAIN + 1 for 1 appetiser = $11 + $18 + $16 = $45Wrong. Because Chapter 55 is so scared that customers will 'take advantage' of the 1 for 1 deal, this is how they calculated the bill:Mushroom soup is $11 for 2. (Written in the menu, don't argue.)Higher cost items are charged, lower cost items are free. (Written in the fine print, don't argue.)Actual bill is: $11 + $18 + $18 = $47Ah Beng and Ah Lian pays up and leaves, vowing to never come back and also something about mothers and fathers.Ok, ok, the story is a little dramatic for a difference of $2. But it is the principle of the whole thing. Even if it is not for principle, then it is about making a quick decision to make Ah Lian and Ah Beng happy customers. Long story short: After the trauma of mathematics and Chapter 55. Ah Beng and Ah Lian grew closer and lived happily ever after,"

Having had work in the area before, its one of the few decent food options available by that hour. Word of advice though for those who drive, good luck finding parking. And when business is brisk, good luck finding a table too. As the name states, they are famous for their porridge. Every possible kind with every possible ingredients / toppings is available here. Called me a traditionalist, but I often go with the staple Pork porridge with century egg. I like the portion sizes especially after a long day at work or play for you clubbers out there. As with most supper porridge stalls, they also serve frog legs porridge. And for those of you who irk at the thought of eating kermit, I will tell you the same thing my parents told me when I was a kid squirming at the very same idea, ""It tastes the same as chicken, only much nicer!"". Its really true as frog meat is lighter and sweeter in texture, and the flavours goes into making the porridge sweet and light too.And for more variety sake, they also serve a very good standard bbq chicken wings and also raw fish (chinese style not japanese sashimi) to go with plain porridge if thats your cup of tea."

I don't think I could ever get tired of either of these dishes. It can get pretty crowded, and you may have to wait a while for tables on a busy night. They have more tables at another outlet besides the small provision shop, so take a walk down that way if the main area on New Bridge road is full.

It's really hard to get Pork Satay and I remember lovin' it in Bali - when I had Pork Satay almost every other day - so it was a pleasant surprise to mix and match, Chicken, Pork and Lamb Satay - and the marinade is really yummy. The Satay turned out great and the peanut sauce was excellent too.What I Love: Service was great - the guy who took my order was a young chap, and was eloquent, and did the satay pretty quickly. Ketupat is free, when you order 10 pieces. You will get Ketupat, since minimum order is 10 pieces anyway. The meat was tender, tasted great, and flavors were just yummalicious! It's great to have satay, drink Coconut Juice, and sit out, looking at all the colorful lanterns. Great ambiance. What I Don't Love: Absolutely nothing!"

We were nearby during its official launch last Friday, so of course, we have to drop by and see (out of curiosity). I was expecting a long queue but to my surprise, there wasn't! We were there around 9-ish. There were over-enthusiastic staff cheering and screaming and giving high fives as we were walking in, I thought I was there to buy an iPhone for a split second. LOL. Queueing up to order was a breeze as there were 4 counters and at least 30 staff in the kitchen churning out burgers, fries, ""concretes"" and milkshakes so efficiently. Very impressive. The wait was manageable, around 20 mins for our order. There was also staff on the dining floor assisting customers with any queries, passing them cutleries, interacting with kids and basically being a great ambassador to the brand. The dining area is big and spacious enough with lots of seating booths, tall tables, and plants. Now onto the burgers - I tried various burgers from Shake Shack before, so I decided to try Chick'nShack. Delicious chicken breast slow-cooked in buttermilk marinate and then fried to perfection served with lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk mayo. Good stuff. We also tried the ""concretes"" - a term used for frozen custard blended with mix-ins. The Shack Attack is the regular cant-go-wrong chocolate mix, but my new found favorite will have to be Eye of the Tiger which is vanilla custard blend with lychee and top with lime zest. Refreshing and not too heavy on the palate. Overall, a pleasant visit and first-time experience at the new Shake Shack branch in the city. I can't wait to be back soon!"

You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center."

And the food and wine are both good and at a ""reasonable"" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The ""house wine"" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!"

I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal."

French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly."

The fam joined us for night 2, and we had a lovely booth to ourselves.Food was not an easy pick - there is a lot to choose from, and almost all of it sounded lovely! Over the two nights, we had loads: the cassolette of escargot was super tasty, especially with the garlicky mushrooms; the mackerel fillet was light, and the accompaniments added great balance (thumbs up for the dressing!); the lamb rack, pork trotter, boeuf bourguigon, and roasted chicken leg?

You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center."

And the food and wine are both good and at a ""reasonable"" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The ""house wine"" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!"

I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal."

French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly."

The waiters were all dressed up and the warm lighting inside with tables tightly packed were quintessentially Parisian. The menu did not disappoint. Good old classics like Coq Au Vin, Confit de Canard, Escargots and Soupe a l'Oignon got me excited. The mackerel salad had caught my eye as I remember a rather delicious variant when I was visiting the French Countryside. I went with that, as well as the Poulet Rotî ( Orast Chicken) for my main course.The Mackerel Fillet marinated in white wine with scented potatoes salad had been so stunning, that was all I could think of since then. The perfumed salad had a light floral and earthy taste, possibly the doing of a herb infused oil. The fish was not the least fishy and it was delicate and soft, marrying perfectly with the potatoes that were lightly dressed. The greens and garnishing herbs were light in flavour not too overpowering, lending a great touch to the delicate textures of the dish. The main course were impressive, enough to leave an impression and a longing to be back.I manage to catch a glimpse of the lunch menu that seemed very economical at just $30 for three course.

The soup soaked up the essence of the dish.Milo Bun with Red Bean Filling 美禄豆沙包 (S$5.80/ 3 pcs) Interesting having bun with skin made with milo powder, but I felt that the filling was more interesting as it tasted different from the usual type and had sesame seeds in it to give it more texture on the otherwise smooth filling.Crispy Pancakes 糖酥饼 (S$3.50/ 3 pieces)The pancakes were freshly made, crispy and light, without been too oily or too sweet.Traditional Pan Fried Bun Stuffed with Pork 傅統生煎包 (S$5/ 3 pieces)The bun was encased with thin skin with juicy filling inside.Wealth Dumpling 百財水餃Pork & Cabbage 猪肉白菜馅 (S$4/ 6 pieces, S$6/ 10 pieces) Similarly thin skin with juicy filling.Pan Fried Dumplings 锅贴 (S$6.80)Similar to the dumplings, but it came with light crispy base.Papaya Jelly 木瓜凍 (S$5.80)The coconut jelly was freshly made daily with rock sugar in limited amount, instead of the common castor sugar. The jelly was firm without been too sweet, and stick to the fruit nicely.Overall the food was delicious and well priced. The staffs were knowledgeable about its dishes."

Was taken here by local colleagues for lunch as I had heard and read quite a bit about the local Singapore cuisine that had sprung up when long ago the Chinese and Malay folks had intermarried and created a new local ethnicity (also called Nonya, i believe) and a way of cooking that melded the Malay curry cooking with traditional Chinese food elements.I put myself in the hands of my colleagues and thanks to them, got to experience an amazing range of starters, mains and desserts! The Assam Prawns were so good - lots of tamarind mixed with palm sugar and just balanced right for that sweet-sour taste. The Ayam Buah Keluak was another delight in each bite - the black nut had this amazing filling that i just could have kept eating all day long. We also got a vegetarian mushroom dish (I can't remember what its was called, but again, just delicious) as well as this dish of Chinese noodles swimming in a wonderful seafood sauce with tons of calamari and baby octopus (yum! yum! yum!). I totally over-ate and wished had a 2nd stomach - only being the company of work colleagues stopped me from licking the plate, it really was that good.Since there's always room for dessert, we got Ubi Kayu, which is a soft sago ball rolled into fresh coconut flakes - just so delicious, and prefect way to end meal. End Verdict?? I would so totally go here again!"

Ingredients easily found in China were not so readily available while in this part of the world, so local ingredients had to be utilized. Cooking with local Malay ingredients in a Chinese style and voilà, an early form of Asian Fusion cuisine was born.Cozy little restaurant that seats 28-30 people I'm guessing. The interior decor was designed to give that authentic shophouse style feel with just enough decorations and colors to tell you that you're definitely not in a Chinese restaurant. It's not uber-chic like Violet Oon's Kitchen but neither are the prices. Unfortunately, there was a large (and loud) table of diners next to us and made our dinner a bit uncomfortable, but at no fault to the restaurant.We had a very nice first experience trying the Peranakan cuisine. There was so much more I had wanted to try but with just 3 people dining, we just couldn't do it. The dish portions were not very large which made it great for sharing and offered a good way to try more dishes with smaller dining parties. I don't know if it's just the style of cuisine but the dishes came out of the kitchen lukewarm or more like room temp. It didn't matter because the heat from the spices made up for it! We tried Ngoh Hiang, Beef Rendang, Babi Pongteh, Garam Assam Snapper, Chap Chye, (and some others I forgot). The Babi Pongteh was a little weird because there were small bits of bones and cartilage in the meat, so it was not a very nice feel in the mouth, although the sauce it came in was nice. So the food was very good and definitely unique in taste, but as a friend suggested when I said we were having Peranakan, everything starts tasting the same after a few dishes. So my suggestion is to try to order dishes that spreads out along the taste spectrum (i.e., spicy, tangy, sweeter, etc.). A welcomed unique cuisine that offers so much more that what we experienced today. Will be back to try the other menu items."

The food ,although in limited proportions was quite tasty. Of particular to mention was beef rendang, fish head curry and long beans Sambal.

I felt a bit lightheaded and my leg muscles were starting to feel painful. We had initially planned to eat at the hawker center but decided we needed AC. this place was small, quiet and super cool inside. We ordered the fish head curry, rice and chop chye. The curry was really really spicy but in a great way with mustard seed and chili and beans and eggplant. I think the spices revived me. The chop chye was decent and had some sweetness that countered the heat from the curry. In order to cool off afterwards I had the tapioca balls with coconut ice cream and palm sugar which reminded me of the yummy desserts I had in Bangkok. The hub ordered something with durian purée on it for the experience. He said it tasted like a rotten sweet garlic. Anyhow the prices at this place were worth it - the curry was 23$ and more than enough for us to share. Anyhow after lunch I felt much more normal and ready to face the heat again outside."

The fish and chips were suprisingly good, not dry and mushy like how it can get. As you cut the fish, it slices into ""flakes"" which told me ""yes this fish is fresh! The vanilla icecream was delicious too. It wasn't just like your normal off the shelf supermarket type ice cream like how i expected.

One of it had thai basil leaves which was damn tasty! Both sausages were juicy and weren't drowned in sauce. For her dessert she had the fresh donut with a side of salted caramel creme.

My team and I had lotsa Chinese food during this festivity, we wanted something different for a change. That's when one of my team suggested to go to ""the study"" as she had been there and had some glowing reviews about the food. ""The Study"" features British comfort food, or so they say... We were about to find out. Have to warn you though... Parking is rather difficult as the restaurant is located in quite a snazzy hot spot where both locals and tourists frequent for food and drinks. Best if you drive up along Neil road to get a spot at the public parking lots, cos if there isn't, you get another chance around Bukit pasoh. Otherwise, just take the MRT, nearest station is at Outram. Restaurant is located nearby with a short walking distance.""The Study"" is a small, cosy restaurant with approximately 40s seats, and styled with modern retro English deco. You have the kitchen within the space of the restaurant where you can get a good view of the talented chefs preparing food. Totally love the vibe!Our order for the evening included:Starters:1. Heirloom Tomato salad with truffle burrata- I totally love this dish! The tomatoes were sweet/sour and was the perfect partner in crime for the truffle burrata. I love how you get the light, refreshing taste of the tomato first then your tongue tastes the truffle burrata, where it starts to fill it with the creaminess of the burrata. That experience is really quite awesome. The only gripe for me was that there was not enough burrata on the plate and I wanted the entire plate to myself! 2. Iberico Pork and Foie Gras scotched egg- This dish was just so beautiful to look at! To me this was something new and it really had an awesome taste to it. The Iberico pork with foie gras somehow tasted like the less salty version of minced spam. I could not taste the foie gras at all which made me slightly disappointed. The crust was crisp and complemented the dish well. To me this dish was yummy but if the chef can do something to bring out the taste of the foie gras it would have been perfect.Mains:3. Baked sea bass with truffled gnocchi- My colleague ordered this. The fish was pan fried to crispy goodness and the gnocchi was al dente. Again, I could not taste the truffle on the gnocchi. Otherwise this is a rather satisfying healthy dish. 4. Roasted lamb loin with Yorkshire pudding -  I asked for medium, but it came out medium to well, causing the lamb to be rather hard. To me this dish wasn't memorable. It was ok to taste but I wouldn't order again. 5. Beef rump steak with crispy shallot rings -  In my opinion, this dish is the restaurant's true signature. The beef that was cooked medium rare (don't worry it's not bloody) and was superbly tender. Definitely a must order! Dessert:6. Doughnuts with cinnamon sugar and salted Caramel cream- OMG! This is a must order! The doughnuts are fried till crispy perfection, the outer layer crisp with cinnamon sugar and the inside dough is buttery soft and fluffy. The salted caramel cream is super light and very Delish! And when eaten together, Pls don't be surprised if you find yourself doing the happy dance! 7. Vanilla cheesecake with ginger crumble and raspberry sorbet- After you have tried the doughnuts, everything else pales in comparison. Hehe... Ok but to be fair, this was not bad. But it would have been better if the chef was able to bring out the taste of the vanilla. I tasted more cheese than I did the vanilla.So was this comfort food to me? I can't say for sure. There were some unique dishes which I very much enjoyed but there were some misses as well. Additionally for what each dish was worth (pricey), the portions were also a tad small even by a lady's standards. That said, this is still a pretty good restaurant to hang with your friends after work for food and drinks. I too will return to try their other dishes. Ps. Please make reservations in advance to avoid disappointment."

After a few hits (the hawkers market) and misses (the white rabbit), the Study really really impressed. We booked early on New Year's Eve. Grabbing a couple seats by the bar we had full interaction with Chef Ayo and his staff. Coming early probably helped as we saw all of their early prep and were able to watch through the night the way they prepared as well as watching the chef schooling his crew in some of the finer points of service. Chef regaled us with stories of his background and we had a great discussion about knives and his use of lamb fat!  I was impressed as we sat down to some roots manuva blasting away followed by a greatest hits of 90s hip hop. A perfect way to set the Eve tone. We shared the scotch egg and heirloom tomato salad. Both were excellent. Tomatoes in this part of the world are hard to find. These were fine set off by some excellent frisée and truffled burrata. The scotch egg was as advertised. Held together by a juicy pork exterior. Clearly a signature dish. Next up was the special : turkey with bread sauce. My step mom with her UK heritage waist fascinated by tiebreaks sauce with was tasty bright and set off the sous-vide turkey perfectly. My lamb was excellent - cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The only disappointment was the leek, kale and pine nut side. A bit limp and watery. Finally ended with a very creamy rice pudding and tasty mango sorbet. Excellent unobtrusive service and access to their fun speakeasy next door. Highly recommend.

For the record, I waited approximately 2 hrs and 30 mins before my turn. I still find it amazing how bak kwa is a such a prized commodity during CNY. Customers from Hong Kong and Malaysia can be easily found among the Singaporeans buying kilos and kilos as gifts for relatives. Yet It is not hard to understand why because the bak kwa definitely lives up to its reputation. Soft, tender and flavourful. Not greasy or tough and filled with fat like other commercial brands (i.e. Bee Cheng Hiang and Frangrance).  Once you tried it, you wont want any of the cheaper options.For those of you who have been hiding under a rock or just plain ignorant yet think highly of themselves, they have 3 shops in Singapore. The main and best is the one along New Bridge Road just beside Pagoda St near the MRT. Yes, thats the main one.

That's probably why I've learnt to associate claypot rice with nighttime fare. Try consuming it in the afternoon in our climate without disintegrating into a puddle of sweat... confirm heatstroke lor.The reason why Lian He Ben Ji's claypot rice is a cut above its competitors is precisely because it doesn't compromise on cooking time and ingredient quality. Each pot of rice is steamed for 5 minutes, after which ingredients are added and the pot left to sit over a blazing charcoal flame for the next 20 minutes. That guarantees you a minimum 25-minute wait per order, which can stretch to a waiting time of 45 minutes during peak dining periods. To get around the wait, regular diners know to call to place their orders in advance. Unfortunately we weren't as savvy.Was the wait worth it? Abso friggin' lutely.Mixed claypot rice, $10 for a portion that feeds two - After drizzling some sweet soya sauce over the rice and mixing everything together, the first spoonful of rice I had can only be described as a flavour explosion. The pieces of chicken were succulent, the lup cheong (Chinese sausages) and waxed meat firm and juicy, but the rice - the rice was in a realm of its own. You just have to taste it to know that charcoal makes one hell of a difference in cooking this dish. The rice in the claypot was smoky yet fluffy, and when drenched in sweet sauce was just... wow. We kept mumbling ""so good, this is so good"" in between mouthfuls of rice. It got even better when our spoons hit the bottom of the pot, where burnt rice, or what we call guo ba (锅巴), was clinging to the sides, just waiting to be scraped off.And the chilli! The chilli here is the bomb okay. It was spicy, sour and caused beads of sweat to form on my temples, but I kept going back for more.To be fair, the slivers of salted fish in the rice could have been less mushy. Plus the soup (lotus root with pork ribs) and stir-fried veggies we ordered were very average. But who really cares? It's a hawker centre, and there're about 50 other stalls if you must have your sides to complement this... claypot of perfection.Now into its second generation of owners, Lian He Ben Ji is an established business that started off as a roadside stall in the same area back in 1979. The founder of the stall handed the reins over to his daughter-in-law, which I think is a really heartwarming tidbit of news in a society that unfortunately still tends toward the patriarchal. The daughter-in-law now runs the stall with her two younger sisters, which is why this place is also known fondly as ""3 sisters' claypot rice"".Lian He Ben Ji gets my seal of approval for their dedication to their craft. I'll definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know."

Wrong choice, each claypot is big enough for two servings each and we ended up leaving the second pot hardly touched.

They also serve the softest pork belly and tastiest kimchi jjigae I've had in Singapore yet. Let's talk banchan. Their kimchi is fresh and is one of the most legit batch around town. The seasoned bean sprouts were salty yet yummy. The seasoned anchovies were the saltiest and must be accompanied with something bland (ie: steamed egg, rice or wraps). The fish cakes were mild while the potato salad was slightly sweet and perfectly soft like mashed potato. While other K-restaurants tend to serve bland side dishes, Superstar K isn't shy to make their banchan take the spotlight. I thoroughly enjoyed the signature King Galbi due to its just-enough-chewiness and not-too-sweet marinade, however my foodie partner preferred the sweet marinated short ribs from Han Kook Gwan more (they were also fresher). To each man his own. We both agreed that the Kimchi Jjigae is one of the most delicious and flavorful we've tried in Singapore. It is like the ones served in Los Angeles' Koreatown. Spicy yet in a sophisticated way. Typically Korean restaurants play Kpop music videos on their television screen. At Superstar K, it's ""Wreck It Ralph"" on replay. I love that movie, but my eyes prefer to feast on Kpop while eating K-food! And if I were eating Indian food, I'd want to watch Bollywood films not Cinderella. Verdict: I'd come back to Superstar K for their Pork Belly, King Galbi and Kimchi Jjigae. And you should, too. However I give a C for Ventilation (my hair smelled of KBBQ for the rest of the night up until I woke up in the next morning). But I'd still go back for the King Galbi again and again :D"

I usually go for two servings of the unseasoned beef ribs, the meat is very high quality and there is no need to drench it in seasonings and mask the flavor. The waitresses grill the beef for you at the table. Each table is fixed in position and can fit from 1 - 6 or so people. They bring fresh charcoal to grill the meat before the meal.You also get a free steamed egg dish with your meal. Basically a steaming pot overflowing with egg is delivered to your table soon after you place your order. It looks intimidatingly large, but it is light and serves as a good appetizer. Another winning dish is the cold noodles in chilled broth, which comes in a huge silver mixing bowl complete with thin slices of beef and a boiled egg inside. Vinegar and mustard are provided to adjust for taste. It's a nice contrast to the heavier beef dishes to end the meal.No reservations and the place is popular, so you will probably be looking at a wait if you go during peak eating hours. No worries though, put your number down, grab a beer nearby and they'll give you a buzz when your table is ready. 20-30 minutes wait is common."

This store is pretty small so there will be a wait list if you come during the weekends. The parking was difficult as there are other restaurants and pubs nearby. Sitting outside while waiting for your table might make you sick of smelling the cigarette smells. The downside of waiting till you are seated is when most of your party have not arrive. They will only give you a table when most of the people in your party has arrived. The maximum amount for a party is 10.This place served a lot of side dishes (kimchi, steamed egg, bean sprouts, anchovies, potato salad and sliced fish cakes). All of them are extremely delicious!! The taste, the texture are in perfect blend. You will at least ask for two rounds for the side dishes.My party ordered pork belly, chicken and cubed beef. It was delicious!! The waitress will help you flip the meat and put on new batch of meat after you are done with it. The customer service was good here.Overall, I like this restaurant and will be back for more with different batch of friends. It is highly encouraged if you use public transport instead of driving there yourselves. Like I mentioned earlier, parking was terrible. Enjoy your delicacy here :) Cheers!!"

Bold choice but there we go.We got a larger table in the centre of the restaurant after a small ""discussion"" with one of the waiters as he wanted to place us behind the entrance door and argued that he might need the bigger tables later on when they get busy. As I had a table reserved - hinting that it was our anniversary - I had expected something else than the back of the entrance, thus I did not like that part of the evening especially when, later on, lots of tables became available.The evening got much better after that as we started with Prosecco, parmigiana and octopus - and their amuse bouche which was a lovely bruschetta.For mains we ordered tagliatelle with lobster and pasta with mussels and fish roe, and had a wonderful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to drink.It all tasted very fine and very authentic - I loved the fact that most employees spoke Italian and that Italian music was blaring from the speakers. Only the interior could benefit from a bit more ""love"", like tablecloth and candles. It all seems a bit too rustic for my taste, as if ""unfinished"".The dessert - a delectable Tiramisu - was the perfect ending, with some Limoncello on the house.
