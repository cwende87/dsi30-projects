To customize your Bento, you have to select 3 different items from various cuisines and flavors... from Mediterranean to Asian. I personally was delighted by the choice of vegetables and the 100% tricolor quinoa instead of the usual and unhealthy polished white rice. Please also try the raspberry soda! It's natural, not too sweet and fresh as it should be!"

Pretty decent food, though the vibe was a bit strange. First all the servers had on this face mask that I believe was intended to prevent them from breathing on the food, but just made the place feel like a hospital. Also, there were a lot of staff standing along the walls with their hands behind their backs just watching the dining room. I suppose this may be more customary in Asian countries, but was a little offputting to me. I mean, who wants to be stared at while eating. Anyway, like I said, most of the good was pretty tasty and came out rather quickly. So all things considered, not too bad."

Place was packed, so we put our name down and they told us to have a seat. After 25 minutes, the manager came up and said it's going to take a bit and thanked us for being patient. We asked for a menu so we could figure out what to order since we thought that would save some time. We were seated after about 40 minutes of waiting and were ready to order but took us at least 10-15 minutes before we could flag down a waiter. We ended up giving our order to the manager. About 5 minutes after we submitted our order, a party of 7 was seated at the table next to us. This is where it starts to go downhill. We are kept waiting and waiting. 15 minutes pass and no one has given us our drinks. 20 minutes after we submit our order, that party of 7 gets their drinks and snacks BEFORE us. We told the manager we wanted to walk but he convinced us and told us he would serve us personally. Our teas come out about 5 minutes after that. After about an hour of waiting our food finally comes out. It wasn't piping hot but more lukewarm at best. They also mentioned they ran out of certain items which we ordered. After our meal we complained to the front desk and waiters who basically stayed silent and didn't say a word. Very disappointing experience. They really need to work on their customer service. I know it gets really busy but don't ignore us after seating us. There is honestly better dim sum options in Singapore so I wouldn't recommend this place."

We ordered the chilli crab AND the butter crab. Both dishes were fantastic! The chilli crab was super HOT and spicy and the butter crab flavor is to die for! Similar to eating New England lobster, you MUST wear a bib or your clothing will be destroyed! Especially with these delicious sauces splattering all over the place as you crack open the crab shells.I must say that even though it was pricey and you could probably find this dish elsewhere in S'pore... it was worth every penny trying this famous Singapore entrêe!

The atmosphere is very nice with a high quality feel and fish tanks. The outside is also quite nice as it is on the water. The chilli crab was phenominal. Very messy but the sauce was so spicy, flavorful, and delicious. Cracking it open and dunking in the sauce was fun and tasty. The only problem was the waitress hovering over us while we were eating and talking loudly awkwardly close. Delicious food with a corresponding price."

The crab is pretty good, but if you have a crab craving you should go to Melben Seafood instead. I would highly recommend the coffee ribs, the egg yolk prawns, and the home made tofu."

Granted, that it was a Saturday afternoon, I have no one to blame but myself for not going down earlier at 11am.I decided not to wait 1 hour for my noodles and hence decided to try Happy Chef. Like, finally yeah!Verdict:- Chicken Chop - Portion was huge and worth every penny of your $6. Chicken was grilled to perfection, tender, juicy and delicious all at the same time. They were overly-generous with the sauce, but I like it that way. The fries were Long John Silver standard (crispy on outside, soft on the inside). However, my only gripe was that the sauce had a heavy BBQ taste which was too 'sweet' for me. I would prefer something more savoury, especially for my meats. The other side of mash potatoes was unique - sauce was homemade and went well with the potatoes. I felt the potatoes was not mashed enough and a tad lumpy.- Fish & Chip - The fish was fresh but the portion was of average size. Fries was good as usual and the coleslaw fresh. I absolutely hate it when hawkers serve 3-day-old coleslaw, thinking they can get away with it by refrigerating it.*Note that for both dishes, you are allowed to choose 2 sides.It is rather sad to see that this coffeeshop thrives on the booming business of Bak Chor Mee and Happy Chef. While Happy Chef may collect 'spillover' clientale from Bak Chor Mee (like me!), I know of some who will purposely make the trip down just to savour the chops. The lone popiah stall stands miserably empty and the hawkers were swatting flies inside. Pity though, but alas that's the way the cookie cumbles!Great western food but will not make a trip down just to patronise this stall. For Bak Chor Mee, yes I will."

They serve a wide range of Hainanese-style Western food which has been drawing crowds from all over SingaporeOne of their popular items is the Chicken Kiev--deep fried chicken rolled with cheese and ham. At $9, I found the price steep initially but the portion was HUGE. The amount of gooey cheese right at the centre was very generous, and thus stealing the limelight from the leading actor, Mr Chicken. There was no doubts about the crispy chicken coating, but the cheese solidified very quickly and turned into a chewy rubber that dislodged from the chicken. The taste emerged neither from the chicken nor the cheese, but the HAM. Better eat while it is still hot.Nothing unique about the homemade mushroom sauce, as raved about in the video.Perhaps we should have ordered the Fish & Chips instead of Chicken Schnitzel $6. Despite the visible black pepper flecks, the chicken itself was bland and nearly tasteless. Did not help much by the salty chilli sauce. Though the entire cutlet was flawlessly fried, some parts of the chicken skin was uncoated evenly and became very soft & greasy .  We wished we had KFC as we slogged through the characterless meat.I can't be sure whether standards have dropped since it's my first try. (The owners who made TV appearance were not there) Furthermore, I have only tried 2 out of the 30 dishes here. Food not exceptional but the Chicken Kiev is still the better out of the two. And I just realised there is an AMK outlet which is nearer to my area. Hopefully the chefs over there are happier."

I didn't really think the sauce was very good either, which tasted like a bad mix of ketchup and bbq sauce. I also tried a bite of the ribeye steak and was also disappointed.

However Mookata in Bugis Junction is rather new to me as I don't remember seeing such a shop.Soon we settled down and order their Set for 2 at $34.90Interior was spacious and with dining tables by the side of the restaurant, leaving the middle a wide area for easier movement.Decorations in dining area was unique with wooden colorful umbrella hanging upside down. Interior is rather modern and does not have any resemblance in the Thai Culture.Each table comes with a ventilator hanging from the ceiling that helps in absorbing the BBQ smoke. Upon Ordering, the helpers switched on the electricity and let our Mookata pot warms up. A flask of sweet corn soup stock was also provided.What I like about their Mookata is their 3 versions of chilli from non spicy, mild spicy and spicy.Set for 2 was a straight forward and fuss free order. It consists of a combination of marinated chicken thigh, pork collar, prawns, squids, suriyaki, streaky bacon, fishballs, pork belly, meatballs, crabsticks, otah fishcakes, Chinese cabbage, kang kong, xiao bai cai, corn, golden mushrooms, eggs, tang hoon & tofu.Set for 2 - $34.90Looking at the amount of meat on the set, we find that the portion was quite little for us and we decided to top up some of the meat portion.Marinated meat was served in orange tray form which can be stacked up together.Additional Chicken Thigh - $7.50The meat was absolutely fresh and well prepared.Additional Pork Collar - $8We poured some of the soup from the flask into the moat surrounding the skillet. The soup was light in taste but sweet. It allowed the essences of grilled meat juice that was placed on top of the skillet to flow down and mix with it to obtain a rich and flavourful soup. For additional taste, you may opt to have your vegetables and other items mixed in too.One good point to take note is perhaps not to pour too much of soup into the pot while you have your grilled items still lying on top of the mookata as the juices will shoot directly onto your hands or faces. I enjoy Mookata even it may cause me smelling like a walking BBQ food item after the mookata session and with the smell clinging onto the hair that gets away after a few wash."

We had to wait  about 10 to 15 minutes for food to come. However, they forgot to serve a bowl of rice until I asked them. Secondly, the portion of food is very small. I did not expect too much but set for 2 is not good enough for 2 person. Moreover, meats were flavorless and seems like not marinated at all. The soup is another nightmare and is over sweetened by MSG. There are three kind of sauses and those are another disappointment. All of them have similar flavor and none of them are good to go with mookata. My overall experience at Mookata was terrible."

I eat here during lunch and always order ala carte. I get that most office folks dig the set lunches which come in these flower shaped platters, but I prefer ordering 3-4 dishes (portions are more than adequate) with friends and it works out to about the same price. Food here is pretty close to what you'd get in Thailand.The fish and prawn cakes here are handmade and fried fresh, just like at Joe's Thai. The tom yam soup is authentic and therefore searingly spicy. Even for someone who comes from a line of chili kings & queens, Jai Thai sometimes gives me a stomach ache afterwards from the spiciness so I usually ask them to tone it down a bit. I also like the steamed tofu with basil chicken, which is a different take on the usual Thai basil chicken. Their prawn tung hoon (which is one of my barometers of a good Thai cook, along with beef soup and fried duck) is darn good too. Basically, I haven't found any dish that wasn't to my liking. Prices are ridiculously cheap but don't tell the restaurant that. Service is hit or miss and if you reach there any later than 12.30pm on a weekday and aren't willing to share a table, go look somewhere else because this place is always packed."

My friends had good reviews about the place, saying the food there was good and cheap so I agreed to give it a try. I ordered the Phad Thai since it is a Thai dish that can determine the standard of a good Thai restaurant. The dish was so fragrant that I could smell it the moment they brought it out of the kitchen. To my surprise, the Phad Thai was flavorful and fulfilling. The dash of lime balanced the sweetness of the dish and made it perfect. Also, it was not dry like how most Thai restaurants do it, so it was really palatable.

It was okay, but you can tell it was previously frozen, taken out and heated. It was actually still cold when I had it. The tandori chicken and kabobs were good, but they were pretty standard.

The chickpea is like the one that you get in an authentic Indian or Pakistani dhaba.The best dish is the karahi chicken which is only made to order and takes close to 20 minutes as its prepared from scratch for every order. A must if you have the time or can do a take away as well.Should try their special chicken fried rice which is very flavourful with large amount of chicken, sauted onions, tomatoes and green chillies.Didn't bother trying any drinks as there is nothing out of the ordinary and are normal items."

The chicken was mildly spiced and the garlic naan was hot and fresh. Finding seating may be difficult at times since this place is so popular with locals and the number of seats are limited by the outside space.

I had the butter naan and at first glance, I was skeptical as I could see the naan dripping with the liquified butter. Not something I would order if I knew it was so high in the cholesterol. When I tore the naan apart, it peeled easily. The texture was soft in the inside but mildly crispy on the outside and it was actually much better than it looked. Even when consuming it without the curry. I also had the chicken masala to go with the naan. This curry was sweet and not spicy. The chicken in it fell off easily from the bone, which is exactly the way I like my meat - stewed for a long time and soft and light on the palette. The curry could have been a little spicier to give it a kick. The teh tarik here is just average and we ordered siu dai to preempt an often too generous dosage of the white matter from the drinks maker. I had a coffee to go too. First time having Indian coffee and I can only say that Indian coffee isn't something I'll ever order again.This place is cheap! You can get all the North Indian food you want - masala, chicken, mutton, naan (all types), fish, whatever here at an affordable price though I hope I haven't spoken too soon less they raise prices. Moderately crowded, all the seats were occupied at 8pm on a weekday night. Will definitely come back to try the other stuff!"

Delicious, and always fresh off the tandoor -- always. They take their leavened breads very seriously. I've been coming here for years and I've never had a cold, stale one. Or one that wasn't delicious.It occupies an entire kopitiam unit at the junction of Serangoon and Desker Roads, so it's bustling, all the time. The staff are efficient, personable and funny; the drinks a touch too sweet, as any north Indian/Pakistani place would be. No night time adventure to nearby Mustafa Centre is complete without cheese naan, chicken kadai, dal fry, pepper fish, haleem and nihari (the latter two sell out early!). It's not quite restaurant-standard clean, but the food is; the surroundings may not be.

Nothing changed. The restaurant is still beautiful, the service is warm and friendly and the food items remain unchanged. and that's pretty sad. We were here for brunch last Saturday before a matinee show at the theater, so we kept things simple and didn't order too much - chicken & biscuit (a southern-style fried chicken sandwiched by a biscuit the size of a standard burger bun with melted cheese topped with a fried egg), a salmon avocado sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Two black coffees to make it a complete meal. One thing about Southern food is that it can get very rich to the extent of cloying if you have it too much, so I would suggest you come in a party of 3 or 4 and share the food. You'll be surprised to hear we can't even finish the food we ordered, as I was struggling to finish the mac & cheese towards the end of the meal. Overall, the food was just decent. Not great. If you ask me if I would return, I will think twice or unless I run out of food options in MBS. A 3-star worthy of an experience only, unfortunately."

So I guess I'm fixin' to just say my peace on the matter and be done with it:  firstly, the bird needs looking at, often it's the ingredient and not the technique, and secondly, the bar needs tweaking if it's going to churn out cocktails from a Southern bar.   The old fashioned I had was so watered down and devoid of flavor as to have been indifferently churned out at a generic airport bar.This concept has a ton of potential and solid branding to back it up, so there is no reason why it couldn't be bigger and better by being entirely different and actually being a roots dining experience rather than selling the illusion of one."

(Miami? That's a little too far South) The menu had almost all the Southern favorites I used to eat regularly when I lived in Atlanta. Fried chicken, collard greens, biscuits, cornbread, shrimp n grits, fried green tomatoes.  The chicken and waffles were good, with the waffles fluffy and the chicken mostly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside (except for 1-2 pieces that were a bit dry). I was particularly impressed by the fried green tomato blt, basically a re-imagined appetizer of fried green tomato slices with pork belly and cheese slathered on top. The peach cobbler had a crisp crust and nice balance of cinnamon and vanilla. It takes 25 mins to get out of the kitchen but I felt it was worth waiting for. Everything was really a high-end restaurant take on traditional dishes, immaculately plated and great service and presentation.The only menu items I didn't see were fried okra and pecan pie. Prices were also rather high, S$45 for the fried chicken n waffles, and S$25 for the peach cobbler. Definitely not your everyday dinner hangout spot.We're pretty far away from the Mason-Dixon line, but I think I found a place to get familiar favorites. 3.5 stars due to the dry chicken and the elevated prices, 4 stars for the good service."

It's a nice decent restaurant and it's not hard to tell by looking at how the host and hostess suited up. I was led to my table after got my name (I didn't have any reservation, it is solely for the purpose of greeting me and to make me feel respected). The waiter who attended to me was very polite and well trained who knows the menu very well. After found out the portion and the wine list, I decided to have the crab cake egg Benedict with a glass of Chardonnay. Trust me, the crab cake is simply awesome. It's not like some of the restaurants make the crab cake with 80% of batter and only 20% of crab meat. This one is opposite, you could get a mouthful of crab meats, so fresh and so yummy and the egg Benedict is perfectly done. It is heavenly delicious when you mix the egg yolk with the lemon hollandaise sauce ... mmmm..... Well, back to the reality ... time to settle the bill.

The menu pricing seems a bit off, as the Swine Burger is one of the cheaper menu offerings at $26, while a plate of chicken and waffles rings in at $45. The burger was all around fantastic--a mix of short-rib, chuck, and brisket, topped with pork belly--and is one of the best burgers you can find in Singapore. The fried chicken is excellent as well, and the macaroni and cheese is a must try.The only disappointment to speak of was dessert. We tried the Mississippi Mud Pie Flower Pot, which was quite small and just OK. At $18, it was hardly worth it, and I would be reluctant to try any of their other desserts, which all seem to hover around that same price point.Lastly, the service during both of our visits was very friendly.

The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was good but the chicken served to us was slightly pinkish still (I noticed this only when reviewing the pictures I took before eating) thankfully, it went down well with 0 salmonella issues! The sandwich comprised of 2 generously buttered slices of Texas thick toast and some pimento cheese, which was really yummy! We shared some buttermilk biscuits, and the biscuits themselves were fairly tasty, the honey butter and jam accompanying it was just okay. The honey butter needed a fluffier texture I think to complement the dougheyness of the biscuit, so a whipped honey butter would've been nicer. All in all, a pleasant meal and I would come back :)"

It's a Michelin star restaurant so you can expect it to be expensive, but throw in the fact that it's located at Marina Bay Sands, now expect yo pay even more than you would in the United States. The steak was excellent. Was it better than the US? But the service, sides, and food are very similar to the states. In fact, they don't even serve Singaporean beer because they want to be like an American restaurant. Interesting! Was it worth the money? It depends what you're looking for. To have excellent service in a high end, fine dining restaurant, and with excellent food, then it's worth it! We love it! In all the street foods we've eaten in Singapore, none ever give us paper napkins. We don't know why. It's just is.

Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate soufflé. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate soufflé. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company."

Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful.

No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.Interior is modern/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from ""the usual"". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner..

But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative ""mixology"" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their ""spiked"" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause.

We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York.  D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point.  On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair.

Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes."

This review is overdue and I finally found time to write it.I visited the other CUT locations as well and am a regular here at CUT Singapore, in particular the one in Beverly Hills. I found the whole setup and service here in Singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well. If you are used to cold shoulder service, think again and visit CUT!The seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer. The staff was and is always polite, professional and naturally friendly. A 5* experience. Note that it is a pricey experience as well though, think 350-400$ for a two person meal. But worth it!!!You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine. This time we chose an Argentinian Malbec, a pleasure to drink. Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way. The young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always.The steak came, together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach.The highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert. Have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven (or a combination of both) right at the table.So if you are looking for your perfect dining experience, come here and you won't regret it!Enjoy ~S."

Additionally, the complimentary selection of breads, rolls, and breadsticks were all pretty impressive - it's hard not to fill up on them, but you should resist.For our main, I split the porterhouse for two. Not cheap ($178 if I recall), but between two it's actually one of the cheaper menu options. They carve the steak table side, which is a nice touch, and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards. The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat. The steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme, butter, and garlic. The meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite.For sides we had the onion rings and broccolini. Both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner. However, they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal.Service was truly fantastic here. Any request or order we had was met almost immediately. Even our order of onion rings came out a little late (maybe 5-10 minutes after the rest of our order) and they gave it to us on the house.

Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef.I was ecstatic when I discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in CUT Singapore. Even before flying off to Singapore, I already knew what I was gonna have for my steak.My favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye, particularly because of that fat, decadent layer up top known as the rib cap. When my Snake River Farms rib eye came, I was shocked with horror. It came WITHOUT the rib cap. I thought I was just unlucky, and during my 2nd visit, I ordered the same thing, only to face the same nightmare for the second time. -_-The rib eye itself was not that good too. It was too dry, and too chewy and was a great injustice to a Snake River Farms beef.I don't think I'll be back to CUT ever again.

I have an incorrigible sweet tooth, and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle. their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best I've had locally, but it's the souffle that shines - there's some magic in the substantial lightness, and all the textures and temperatures in it. I could wax lyrical all day (and I've done it once before), but really, just look at it - chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate.but you've heard me say all this before - so I'll try to spare you further expostulation. suffice to say that the standard's consistent, the chocolate deep and satisfying - well worth any gym-rat behavior. we also managed two other desserts this time - a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee, chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream; and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream.both were pretty good - and I especially liked the the chocolate-hazelnut slice (though I might be biased as a newtella addict), though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish. small detail though - we lapped everything up. the place is dark and intimate, service friendly and efficient - and really, the prices aren't low but I'm more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions. most definitely my favorite place here. ----------------------------------------------old review:utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss-out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands.

It's not uncommon to find $100 steaks on the menus of many high-end restaurants. At Cut though, the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers, sides and mains - which are done well, if you need to justify the bill. A hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past $500 easily.When you're mulling over the menu, the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with American cuts in white napkins and Japanese cuts in black. The service is absolutely impressive - if you are familiar with Morton's you'll know what I mean.For wagyu lovers and first timers, I highly recommend the Tasting of New York Sirloin - it includes Kobe style from Snake River Farm (120g), USDA Prime corn-fed (120g), and Japanese wagyu from Shiga (60g). As you can guess, these are pretty tender and marbled choices, so if you prefer something more robust, try the Angus ribeye or such. It's a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone. Wolfgang Puck pops by to Singapore about once a year. so don't expect to see the man himself - instead, he's got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the US to oversee this jumpin' joint. The music's rather loud but we're told it's the way they like it in the States."

But I feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly ""incomplete"" experience, because it is just that good.What can I tell you about the cocktails here? I don't want to recommend a specific one... I'm sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? ""It's not going to be the same.."" I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn't... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails. And if you ever do go, don't forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert -- it's the bomb.Singapore has many cocktail bars, but a few great ones. I count the bar at CUT and the one at Tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail, time and time again."

We often see lots of customers dressed in suits after work so it has never come across our mind that this can be a potential awesome dining place. We assumed it's more of a drinking outlet!Had our lunch here on a Monday. Although they have a lunch menu, we opted for the main menu as well. Apparently, the lunch comes in sets ($22.80) which includes a complimentary FREE-FLOW tapas by the bar with every main course purchased. Also, it comes with either a house special ice cream or coffee/tea. We did not go for this set as we wanted to try something more adventurous from the main menu... Although I must say the tapas bar looks really tempting. Garlic Basil prawns was AWESOME due to the sauce which I believed was prepared with white wine and garlic. Great combination! I would suggest everyone to give this a try. We had 3 pizzas and all were almost equally good but I particularly loved the truffle pizza and pizzoto pizza (crispy bacon and melty egg in the middle)!! The portion was HUGE, each pizza is good for say 2-3 people. For the portion, quality and taste, I think the pizzas are definitely worth the price at $26.80..."

I had the Greg Norman and my boyfriend had the Mexico City and we both really enjoyed the flavors and overall taste. The Wagyu beef on my Greg Norman was well-cooked and juicy. Both the regular and sweet potato fries were okay. The passion fruit lemonade was a little tart but better with simple syrup. The service was average. Our waitress seemed rather busy but we were able to flag down someone when we needed something. It has an urban and upbeat atmosphere so it's a great spot for dinner with friends.

However- the milkshakes are just as crazy and ridiculous and over the top as they are anywhere else, and I welcome the addition of flavors that are more unique to Singapore."

Just keep that in mind as you read this review. Allergy alert: Worse place is you have food allergies!!!! They use the same fryer for EVERYTHING! So I can't eat the fried that come with the burger, so I have to pay $3 for substituting my fries. NOT HAPPENING!So since I can't eat anything that is cooked in the fryer which eliminates about 75% of the menu items. Now I ordered a coke and they serve it with a lemon inside; seriously!!!! If I order a plain coke I expect to get a plain coke, nothing added to it; no surprises. Surprise additions to food and beverage is a nightmare for those of us suffering from food allergies. Now for the main course. I ordered the California burger, no bun, no mayo (they have truffle mayo), no pickles. Which I may add I am glad I asked because they put them on the side of the burger even though it is not advertised on the menu that they do. Yes, I am allergic to pickles. So I paid full price for a burger and I can't eat any of the sides that it comes with. I only stayed because I could tell my husband wanted to have one of the burgers on the menu. We were told it would take approximately 15 minutes for the food to be ready. I was already starving so the 15 minutes felt like forever. The music didn't help. Thankfully it didn't take that long. I can't believe I paid 22 Singapore dollars for the ""burger"". What made it worse is that I could tell that the server could care less about my food restrictions. Seriously, I am not picky!!! I would rather not end up in the hospital or die after eating at your establishment. This is the 1st place in Singapore where I encountered insensitive people!!!! Music: OMZ!!!! I can't believe I had to listen to that music. We all have our music that we like and don't like, and the music they play is not anywhere close to my choice of music. There are plenty of artists with quality voices, then the ones playing. Like I said, someone else might like that music and that is fine."

However, my experience was very unsatisfactory for price charged.For a burger restaurant, the burgers were very average - at $22 dollars a pop, you expect extraordinary. I ordered the the American which I asked for medium-rare and the beef was still walking! The burger could use more sauce, though on the plus side, the chips were great. My partner ordered the Mexican burger and what a let down it was. It sounded like such an amazing concept but it was poorly executed. The fried onion ring filled with jalapeños was cold and did not fit with the flavour combination of the rest of the burger. When you hear Mexican burger you think - warm, spicy, packed with flavour - yet this burger was not even close. In terms of the menu, I was unsatisfied with its deceptive nature. Beside all of the house beers appears to be a price, hence why I was very excited to order a Californian brew for only $5.9! Yet when I received the bill, there was a $16.70 charge for that very drink. According to the overly-helpful waitstaff, this was in fact the alcohol content of the beer and the price was written in very small font in another part of the menu. If this had been explained upon arrival, I would not have spent such a pricey amount on an average beer. However, on a positive note, my food came very quickly, the menu had a great variety of drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic and to top it off the shakes were extremely large and filling and worth the money."

The wait in line took close to 90 minutes before we got a seat at the bar for 3 pax. Many people who came in pairs were seated quickly so one tip is to go as a couple then you don't have to spend too much time waiting. On to the burgers. The 3 of us ordered the All American, The Greg Norman and the Old Fashioned burger. My ranking in terms of taste is The Greg Norman, All American and the Old Fashioned. Why in this order? The blue cheese in the Greg Norman really brought out the luxurious taste of the wagyu and it was just a great delight demolishing the burger. All patties were medium cooked and it was perfect for the all American if you are just straight up hungry for a good burger. The most disappointing was the old fashioned because the patty was too well done. I supposed with the extra time needed for the cheese to melt and the mushroom to be nicely topped, the patties were more cooked than it needed to be. Another thing to praise is the yummy sweet potato fries on the side. I would go for that rather than onion rings any time. THE ALL-AMERICAN BURGER | $22prime burger, lettuce, tomato, pickles,american cheese, special sauceTHE OLD FASHIONED | $22prime burger, crimini mushrooms, swiss,caramelized onions, horseradish sauceTHE GREG NORMAN | $26wagyu beef, house buttermilk-dill,blue cheese, arugulap.s i prefer shake shack! :P"

If no where else in America could get it right, how could a small place inside of a mall in Singapore do it? I'm not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good.Is it true to form NYC? Not entirely. They're a bit on the small side but boy, do they have a bite to them. The old myth of New York bagel success was something along the lines of ""it's (the elements) in the water"" but was later debunked to be the boiling process of said water and barley to make it truly stand out. Could Two Men be employing a similar method?They claim to be the first bagel house in all of Singapore and started only a handful of years ago. Each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who don't want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability.The bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density. The variety is not impressive to most New Yorkers / Montreal folks, but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar, salt, garlic, and all-sorts (everything bagel). The salmon they're using is not the kind of lox I'd find back home, but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world.For first timers, keep an open mind. This is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the US. Try one of their bagel sandwiches (I vote for the lamb or bo-ssam) and beware of the morning lines."

Walked up to the order counter and just about everyone in the kitchen greeted me with a big hello and a smile. Don't come here if you're looking for a bona fide, proper New York bagel because the owner, Borne, tells me that his bagels are made with the Singaporean taste buds in mind. He's tried bagels from both coasts of the U.S. (probably in between too) and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller. He make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality.

I went with a friend and got 3 bagels toasted, with no schmear, mostly due to the price tag. The schmear costs +$3-5 extra, which is quite significant compared to the cost of the bagel.

The smoked beef one is particularly good, although being able to go and buy a decent smoked salmon bagel in Singapore still remains one of my favourite discoveries in the relative food desert of Tanjong Pagar.

The layout of the restaurant is very ""chill"" and carefully planned. The menus are written across the wall in chalk, in a font that screams hipster style. You can take your time and read the menu, and I've seen quite a few people (myself included) taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time. When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready. I recommend doing their ""Two Men's Crafted Bagelwiches,"" don't just get a plain bagel with cream cheese. They have gotten so creative with their menu, and I have to say there is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound mouthwateringly delicious to me. I am working my way through their menu, and so far everything I've had is top notch. My favorites so far are the ""Cow King"" and the ""Bird,"" and what I really love about this place is that you can choose whatever type of bagel you want for the bagelwiches.

Hence upon moving to Singapore, I scour the island every time my inevitable cravings hit. Two Men Bagel is an obvious choice for bagel lovers and you can see from the queue that it's made up of a lot of homesick westerners. The bagels are no where near as massive as in New York and it doesn't have that sheen to it, but then again, they don't have the water. The sandwiches are inventive, bordering on too ambitious. Because the bagels themselves aren't that large, the filling often falls out, leaving your hands a mess. Like all foreign foods swept far from their homeland, it's more expensive (especially the drinks, my God it's robbery) and not as good, but it's all we have. +1 star for the great 90's and 00's rap and hip hop playlist, interrupted only by great 00's emo music."

The bagel arrived shortly thereafter. What surprised me was the brown colour of the roast beef but I tasted it anyway. It did taste different from what I am used to, and was a bit too thick and fatty for my personal taste, but the greens and the relish and the sauce.. very nice. The bagel itself was close to fluffy, but still some density for a good bite and taste without having to worry about an immediate shutdown of any bowel movements which is often the case with heavy bagel dough.Later on I was curious whether roast beef in S'pore is different from what I am used to and went on their Facebook page: there was a photo that showed the Rodeo with pinkish roast beef. So, I don't know what piece of meat I had today but it surely (unfortunately I forgot to take a photo..) wasn't the standard.I did love the friendly, smiley staff.

I was all ""hrmph who brings store bought food to a potluck?"" as I cooked my organic sausages from Ryan's when he said, ""I brought bagels"". That made me almost drop my sausages right there.Bagels?!! In Singapore? """"Please tell me it's not those expensive things masquerading as bagels from 'New York' that are sold in Cold Storage?""""Nope it's from Two Man. It's right by my house, I chat with them all the time and they make awesome, as-good-as-it-gets-in-Singapore bagels...oh and try the walnut cinnamon raisin something magic spread in that tub and thank me later.""At that point I was pretty stoked to find the bag contained TWENTY bagels in a gazillion flavors. I couldn't find a sesame bagel (cos I'm boring like that) but I found a brown raisin one, popped it in the toaster and generously spread the magic stuff on. Oh. Ma. Gawsh. Oh. My.I ate that bagel in about a minute. And then I ate a half more.It was crisp on the outside and had a good chew. Granted it isn't New York or Bodo's great, but hey we're in Singapore.

I'd have one (or two) a day every time i'm in NYC (it's my post yoga breakfast staple). I even signed up for bagel baking classes just so that i can make my own (i still haven't though) because nothing in Singapore satisfies my craving. Well Sacha & Sons does a decent one but there is only 1 option (sesame, with garlic herb schmear). I've been meaning to try Two Men Bagel for the longest time, upon word that freshly baked hand-rolled doughs are done here. To determine the quality of the bagel, i had to order them on their own. Bagels are priced from $2.60 onwards. I went with the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Walnut and Raisin Cream Cheese ($4.50) because sweet is always logical with a latte.Well well. Knock knock. The crust was more like a shell, with a slightly blistered crust all around. It was too hard (mind you i'm comparing them to the NYC ones). Plus the dough was a little thin, thus it lacked that nice doughy chew. Flavor wise, it was also kind of strange, with an alkaline aftertaste, possibly due to the almost pretzel like shell. Perhaps i should have stuck with the regular cream cheese because the walnut raisin one was kind of grainy instead of rich creamy and the amount was so little! URGH. #spoiltbynyc Next time, i may just go with the Plain Cream Cheese and Berries Jelly but honestly they need to have more cheese on these.Well Jr really liked the Chix ($9.90) on his onion bagel. The tender house-roasted diced chicken thigh were generously smothered in lemon garlic aioli and peppered with the sourish pickled relish and fresh greens. We both agreed that the filling was delicious but it overshadowed the bagel. It could have been any other bread. In fact, it would have been better if it were a different carb that didn't jab our gums with the hard shell. I had a few bites of the onion bagel on its own and it was rather flavorless, alkaline, and hard. BAH.I really wanted to love Two Men Bagel, but i can't. Can i like it? Maybe. But it kinda ranks the same as the packaged NYC Bagel Factory bagels, which may not be as fresh but at least their crust is better. Go for their bagel-wiches to avoid disappointment. At least it'll fill you up and the filling will distract you from the bagels. Or get the sesame bagels from Sacha & Sons and slather it with your own cream cheese mix."

If no where else in America could get it right, how could a small place inside of a mall in Singapore do it? I'm not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good.Is it true to form NYC? Not entirely. They're a bit on the small side but boy, do they have a bite to them. The old myth of New York bagel success was something along the lines of ""it's (the elements) in the water"" but was later debunked to be the boiling process of said water and barley to make it truly stand out. Could Two Men be employing a similar method?They claim to be the first bagel house in all of Singapore and started only a handful of years ago. Each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who don't want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability.The bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density. The variety is not impressive to most New Yorkers / Montreal folks, but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar, salt, garlic, and all-sorts (everything bagel). The salmon they're using is not the kind of lox I'd find back home, but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world.For first timers, keep an open mind. This is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the US. Try one of their bagel sandwiches (I vote for the lamb or bo-ssam) and beware of the morning lines."

Don't come here if you're looking for a bona fide, proper New York bagel because the owner, Borne, tells me that his bagels are made with the Singaporean taste buds in mind. He's tried bagels from both coasts of the U.S. (probably in between too) and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller. He make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality.

You have to make sacrifices if you're not eating local specialties. Once I got over that, it was great. Every choice so far has been done perfectly, the bagel toasted yet soft, the ingredients top quality. The smoked beef one is particularly good, although being able to go and buy a decent smoked salmon bagel in Singapore still remains one of my favourite discoveries in the relative food desert of Tanjong Pagar. The filling is generous enough that these days we split one between two, but we're not big eaters. Service is fast and friendly."

I've been living in Asia for about 5 years, and bagels are really tough to come by. This place reminded me of the bagels I had growing up, they're definitely top quality. The layout of the restaurant is very ""chill"" and carefully planned. The menus are written across the wall in chalk, in a font that screams hipster style. You can take your time and read the menu, and I've seen quite a few people (myself included) taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time. When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready. I recommend doing their ""Two Men's Crafted Bagelwiches,"" don't just get a plain bagel with cream cheese. They have gotten so creative with their menu, and I have to say there is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound mouthwateringly delicious to me. I am working my way through their menu, and so far everything I've had is top notch. My favorites so far are the ""Cow King"" and the ""Bird,"" and what I really love about this place is that you can choose whatever type of bagel you want for the bagelwiches.

Hence upon moving to Singapore, I scour the island every time my inevitable cravings hit. Two Men Bagel is an obvious choice for bagel lovers and you can see from the queue that it's made up of a lot of homesick westerners. The bagels are no where near as massive as in New York and it doesn't have that sheen to it, but then again, they don't have the water. The sandwiches are inventive, bordering on too ambitious. Because the bagels themselves aren't that large, the filling often falls out, leaving your hands a mess. Like all foreign foods swept far from their homeland, it's more expensive (especially the drinks, my God it's robbery) and not as good, but it's all we have. +1 star for the great 90's and 00's rap and hip hop playlist, interrupted only by great 00's emo music."

I've been living in Asia for about 5 years, and bagels are really tough to come by. This place reminded me of the bagels I had growing up, they're definitely top quality. The layout of the restaurant is very ""chill"" and carefully planned. The menus are written across the wall in chalk, in a font that screams hipster style. You can take your time and read the menu, and I've seen quite a few people (myself included) taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time. When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready. I recommend doing their ""Two Men's Crafted Bagelwiches,"" don't just get a plain bagel with cream cheese. They have gotten so creative with their menu, and I have to say there is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound mouthwateringly delicious to me. I am working my way through their menu, and so far everything I've had is top notch. My favorites so far are the ""Cow King"" and the ""Bird,"" and what I really love about this place is that you can choose whatever type of bagel you want for the bagelwiches.

At that time I was not too sure if Yelp in Singapore works as good as the one back in the states. But glad I read through all the reviews before I went into the actual store. Told my colleagues about this place and got her hook up with this AMAZING bagel house. She ended up going to this bagel house almost everyday. Meanwhile, I was busy with my works and didn't start to visit this place until two weeks ago. It turns out to be the best bagel place I ever been to!!! HANDS DOWN!!! They HANDMAKE all of their bagels (which you rarely find it even in the states) Personally, I grew up eating a lot of bagels during my high school years. I always had some cravings when I came back to Asia. Luckily, I discovered this place and all the bagels here are on point. Also, all the staffs are very SWEET and shoutout to Borne for making amazing coffees all the time. Food: a variety of bagels you can choose from. They have some great menus and definitely going to suit your taste buds. My favorite one is LOX bagel and they deliver good quality foods consistently! People & service: I always value customer services more than anything else. I promise  you, you won't regret talking to any of those staffs there!!! I pay a full respect to the business model they have for the bagel house.Keep up with the good work man!!! Will definitely come back visiting when I come to Singapore :)"

The piglet, which includes a hash brown, crispy bacon, garlic aioli sauce, lettuce, and maybe tomato(?), was scrumptious. Definitely one of the best bagel sandwiches I've ever had. On top of that, they serve these bad boys all day long.Prices are reasonable ($8.50 for the piglet) if not a touch pricey given the size of the servings. Taste makes up for that though. I also went out on a limb and splurged on the $4.50 lemonade. It was worth it. I even got a free refill; probably wouldn't happen if I hadn't been one of only 3 or 4 customers on a lazy Sunday, but kudos for the responsive service given the circumstances.The vibe is relaxed and you can see the young staff rolling the dough and tossing those suckers in the oven.

That being said. I totally love this place.  The bagels are great and fresh.  I love the sandwich selection. And then they have seasonal ones during the holiday like pumpkin cream cheese around halloween.  They have great breakfast sandwhiches too.  The people are ALWAYS super nice. They say hi when I walk by.  Always ready to strike up a conversation. It has a nice little cafe feel.  Its a nice spot to just hang out and work on your laptop and have some coffee.  Totally recommended.

My first counter with Two Men Bagel House was during a Yelp event that my friend brought me to (also the event where I downloaded the app and joined the community) where there were coffee and bagels! I had quite a good impression of the menu that they brought over during the event and definitely fell in love with the Jalapeño cream cheese - it is to. die. for. (IMHO*) The bagels that were brought to the event were way beyond the normal plain bagel, and my friend and I were lucky enough to be the last to share a sundried tomato bagel - I highly recommend this because the bagel itself is so flavorful! It was a more DIY / pick-your-own-fillings at the event, which I liked because friend and I decided that we should share the bagel AND have two different flavours in one bagel as we didn't want to take one each - too much bagel for breakfast! My office recently moved to somewhere near Icon where TMBH is located, in fact, we're practically across-the-road neighbors now! And, I had to had down to try at least one other bagel, right? Thus began the quest to find lunch buddies who wanted bagels too - which wasn't too hard because all I had to do was shout 'bagels for lunch?' and I got a few brave volunteers that took the journey to TMBH with me. There was a crowd! It was around lunch time and there were many other brave knights who had braved the CBD heat to Icon and were waiting be around for their orders. Even though TMBH has seats, not many were filled up because office people, we just like to have lunch in office (me especially, because what's a cafe in the office for if we don't use it!) I got myself a Piglet to bring back and I swear, best piglet ever. It's something I highly recommend everyone to try if they're looking for a breakfast /brunch / lunch bagel!* in my humble opinion"

Hello! How are ya?  I was intrigued, and everyone knows you shouldn't go into the grocery store hangry, so.... off to bagel land I went. I asked him what the most popular bagel situation was and he told me two, one was the Rodeo.  I was a little skeptical being from Texas, anything in Singapore called the Rodeo could not like up to that name, right?  But it sounded mildly interesting so I went with it.  The service first of all is super friendly, but they only take cash, or net.  No CC.  My bagel goodness gcame out in a jiffy, and it was REALLY good.  I chose the sea salt bagel (they should sell them to go) and it came with some kind of mustard relish and roast beef I think.  Whatever the mixture, it was good.  I could barely finish it, because it is a meal, but VERY tasty.  My only worry is that if I move in the neighborhood this will up my carb intake, but it'll be worth it!"

But 101 before in baking dough is, dough needs to rise. This gives it that consistency of that doughy taste. Unfortunately there was no rise.

I always had some cravings when I came back to Asia. Luckily, I discovered this place and all the bagels here are on point. Also, all the staffs are very SWEET and shoutout to Borne for making amazing coffees all the time. Food: a variety of bagels you can choose from. They have some great menus and definitely going to suit your taste buds. My favorite one is LOX bagel and they deliver good quality foods consistently!

Satay features prominently here, since this is Singapore, but there's lots to choose from - some better than others.

But since it is called ""Satay By The Bay"" you have to try the satay!City Satay is one of the first stalls you'll see and smell and you can't go wrong with this one. Cheap and great quality satays! The menu shows various set options and a set of 20 is perfect for two people to share. Do note you can mix and match your meat options. I recommend their chicken satay: flavorful, very tender, grilled to perfection, and goes very well with their sauce!Serving sizes are a tad small but the flavor of the satay and the quantity makes that irrelevant. They do provide a lot of the yummy sauce, always a plus!Overall, a convenient location for a hawker with good options. A must-visit if you're craving satay!"

There was definitely a lack of adequate beverage selections at this pavilion, and I did find a place that had a guava smoothie. It was like sludge and the most unappetizing smoothie I've ever had. I don't know what other ingredients were in it, but I begrudgingly drank it because I was that desperate for something that would go down easy. I will never forget this awful smoothie. I still cannot believe I drank it all. I kept thinking I could get used to the taste, but I never did. Because there is so much I didn't get around to trying, I figure there are better dishes around the pavilion, but we eventually went to another venue about an hour and a half later to get different food to make up for what lacked in this visit."

The chicken meat literally fell off the bones.  The jasmine rice was moist, fragrant, and complemented the wings.  Following the wings, I tried an egg and onion briyani from the briyani stand.  The breading was good - soft, fluffy and the onion added a kick to the light flavoring.  If you are an egg lover - like me - the briyani probably could have used two eggs to give it a bit more omelette/egg flavor. Satay By The Bay has lots of other foodie options, including fresh seafood offerings.  There are lots of Chinese cuisine stalls (e.g dumplings, stir fry, and noodles) and most definitely several satay stalls - hence the name Satay By The Bay.  There is also a full bar and juice bar that also offers fresh cut fruit.Lastly, Satay By the Bay has a nice garden surrounding, and is worth visiting if you don't want McD while you are at the Garden By The Bay."

Not just a modern food court, Satay by the Bay brings back some of the old charm of the old Satay Club. Maybe it's the outdoor setting with its wooden stools and low tables or Maybe it's the hint of salt water coming from the reservoir. Which ever it is, it's certainly made Satay by the Bay one of our favourite food joints. While we've yet to try everything here, there are some notable stalls we would and wouldn't recommend. Sri Geylang SateDefinitely our favourite stall of the 6 (or 8?) stalls available here. I suppose Satay is quite selective. We love this store because the meats are well marinated and very fragrant. The chicken is is juicy, mutton too. Beef, a little of the dry side but still very very tasty. City Satay is probably the most popular of the Chinese owned satay stalls. Maybe it's the variety or the fact that they're a well know brand but personally, I feel that he sauce is a little synthetic and factory made. Boon Tat Barbecue SeafoodDefinitely our favourite Tze Char stall here. They have a good variety of dishes but we personally enjoy the BBQ stingray here. Unlike other BBQ stingrays, the chilli used here is more dry Belachan than it is Sambal. It's salty, flavorful and goes very well with the stingray. Another favourite is their Special Fried Chicken wings. Refusing to say what the marinade or batter really is, there is a hint of fermented prawn past. The chicken is nice and crispy and very juicy (except for our last visit where it was a little over cooked). Maybe they aren't used to the crowds thanks to Gardens by the Bay's Christmas Carnival. Another notable mention is Wholly Crab. Opened by local celebrity Felicia Chin, the crab in a bag looks absolutely delightful. Though we haven't tried it personally, the number of people happily digging in and licking their fingers is enough to get my attention and we're going to try it next time! Overall, we love this place. Is it touristy? A little but there's enough good food here to keep the locals coming back. Some items may be on the slightly pricier side as compared to our regular food court or food centre stalls but, it's still worth the walk and definitely worth the price. Satay Party anyone?"

It was a mix of locals and tourists which also seems like a positive sign. The people were very friendly and the whole area was very clean overall.

First to start... just walking into this place feels VIP... and the cocktails are phenomenal.The muscat cocktail was my favorite to start with, and the Japanese peach.We were seated in the bar area first and when our private room was ready, we went in. It's pretty amazing that everyone gets a chefs table seat and you get to watch majority of the food prepared in front of you.It's an omakase that consists of fresh seafood and some meat. Dietary requests can be accommodated as well. But I myself don't have any so I just go with whatever the suggest.Chef Tetsuya is mega famous and he is literally the god father of soooooo many world renowned talented chefs. I honestly don't even know if he knows how many of his offspring are very successful chefs with multiple restaurants under their belts in highly populated cities. I've been to many Tetsuya offspring restaurants, so although it was my first time eating at his restaurant and even though it was prepared by one of his chefs and not him, the dishes were embraced by my palette.I left this restaurant soooo happy. Even though we came to celebrate my hubby's bday... I felt like it was mine. Every dish was beyond amazing.I am a big fan of the abalone, the prawn and the Wagyu cooked to perfection as well as their signature dish... the sea urchin, baby Shrimp & Caviar. Just stunning. The seafood bouboulaise with bread was also excellent. I hope to come back sometime in this lifetime!"

They only serve 20 customers at a time, in small 6 people dining rooms in front of a grill and your own chef.Dinner is omakase only with a price tag of 400SGD plus tax, and of course you may wish to pair it with wines (a wine pairing where every dish comes with a recommended wine or sake costs additional 250SGD).Service is elegant but also extremely personal. Since I was dining alone, my server made a point to strike conversation a couple of times, gently and always respectfully. I really appreciated the tone and the courtesy of all the servers.The dinner starts with impressive raw seafood dishes, among which I certainly was amazed by their signature dish, a composition of sea urchin (uni), shrimp and caviar. One of the most delicious dishes I ever had, and I traveled extensively in Japan tasting some of the best kaiseki ryori in the country. Other gems followed: tagliolini with caviar and freshly grated truffle. Abalone gently grilled and then smoked in front of us with cherry blossoms (!). A bouillabaisse of lobster. Delight after delight, concluded by a delicious and delicate ochazuke.Each dish was expertly described, along with suggestions to enjoy its flavor at the best.After dinner, each party is moved to their own table, together with people from the other rooms, in another common dining space overlooking the marina and the famous Singapore skyline, not to mention the light and fountain show. Here delicious desserts are served (pre dessert, main and petit four, in a very customary sequence).In summary, this was a masterpiece dining experience, flawless from start to finish in all its most minute details. The price tag is serious, but I am not regretting a single dollar at the end of this sumptuous dinner."

We split the lobster spaghetti, Wagyu chim over rice and the fried chicken. The Wagyu was so wonderfully fatty you could feel you're gallbladder contract after eating it.

Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu."

I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene. At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (""Ghin"" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of. The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!"

Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the ""menu"", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal.

I had the following (out of order unfortunately)1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist.7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience."

Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once. Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent. The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that. One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening."

The experience is without a doubt very expensive but the 10 course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time. I am certain that I can't describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have. However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service. If you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner, this is not your place. The staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests."

Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu.  The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience.  In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world.  Now, that's an achievement! The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff.  To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks. Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side.  Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space.  Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline. The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening.  Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms.  This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu.  We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef. The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us.  I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list.  If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin. Our menu:* 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy* Scampi Pasta* Gyokuro Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat.  I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive!  At least we know it's fresh! Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along.  I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal. Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food.  Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth!  Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction.   Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert.  The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Our dessert menu:* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening.  We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening.  A lovely touch and memento. Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience.  From the food, to the decor, to the service.  This is seamless top class dining.  This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come."

(And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway). The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ /10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff. The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite.  For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well."

After a day of sightseeing and getting lost in the Marina Bay Sands complex, sitting down in the Club55 lounge felt like heaven. We arrived at 8 pm right as the restaurant opened and were seated immediately next to a window, which provided gorgeous floor to ceiling views of the bay and Singapore skyline. We were one of only about 5 tables the entire night, which worked out well for us as everything was always stocked and service was attentive. The buffet itself runs $48 per person (about $35 USD), with cocktails and glasses of wine running around $18 a piece. I opted for the wine pairing for $19, which included a red and white wine (both from Chile) as well as a port. The red was definitely drinkable, though the others were a bit disappointing. I'd probably suggest skipping this and going for a cocktail or other bottle of wine instead. There is a self serve coffee, juice, and soft drink bar, though this is not complementary and will be added to your tab. The bread and cheese selection here is solid. They had three loaves of sliced fresh bread - French, wheat (though the placard said sourdough), and one with dried fruits - as well as an assortment of breadsticks and more cracker-type carbs. As for the cheese itself, there were probably about a dozen options. The cheeses were mostly French, though they also had a Swiss Emmental and a few hard cheeses from the UK. My personal favorites were the Camembert and the blue/Brie combo. Rounding out the cheese bar was a small selection of nuts, dried fruit, honey and preserves, and probably the best grapes I've had in a long while. The serving setup was a little awkward, as most of the soft cheeses were presented as an entire wheel, with a few scattered knives throughout so that you can cut your own wedge. I think they also need to come up with a refrigerated way to present the cheese selection, as a few of them did look a little ""sweaty"" as the evening went by. The dessert bar here was an absolute dream. There were easily over two dozen options, and every dessert was presented beautifully. They were mostly individually served portions, though there were a handful of gorgeous cakes, like the cheese wheels, that were presented whole with cake servers to cut your own slice. Highlights for me were the assorted macarons, the dark chocolate and orange creme brûlée, and the assorted mousse cups (especially the caramel+coffee combo and the white chocolate avocado mousse. I also really appreciated that they had fresh grapefruit and honeydew to break up some of the richness. For some reason the dessert bar also had mini Milky Way bars and Hershey kisses, though I don't know why anyone would waste valuable stomach real estate with those.  Overall, this was a fantastic experience, and well worth the money in my book, as just a ticket to the MBS observation deck is about half the price of this incredible spread. And with Singapore (especially the Marina Bay Sands area) being as pricey as it is, this buffet is an absolute steal."
