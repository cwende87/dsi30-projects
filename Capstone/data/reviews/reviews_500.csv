Chinatown Cheng Kee Hokkien Mee,"335 Smith St #09, Chinatown Food Street Singapore 050335 Singapore ",050335,1.2822749605271,103.843238518071,[],Victor L.,69xsJFjiOAd8Ld7WWk_tEw,"Toronto, Canada",3,2/3/2017,"This place is in the tourist area of Chinatown.  Obviously, it is more expensive than other hawker markets.  The meal was just ok and there were so many stalls to choose from. The plus is that they made it fresh but it took around 10 min before I got my meal.  People who ordered the other items got their meal quicker.  The environment is not too special as you are sharing tables like a food court.  It is more cleaner than the typical hawker market but they are everywhere, there are cleaners to wipe down the table.  I likely would go to other places nearby to try to local cuisine. After my meal, I passed by the 1 star michelin restaurant that I heard of on TV programs.  It may be busier on other times since when I went, it was in the middle of Chinese New Year."

Hidden amidst old shops along Temple Street, this independent cafe may seem a little incongruous, but the charming interior and A/C provides a cool respite from the rest of Chinatown. On our visit we had the Mango Beer (Can, $9.50) imported from Taiwan and an Americano ($3.50). The Mango beer tasted like fizzy fruit juice, and the only hint of the alcohol is a slight hops taste at the end. Great for those with a sweet tooth. We also had the wings ($6.50), which, according to our server, comes with ""home-made mustard sauce""! The left side of the cafe is lined with notebooks, bags, etc that gives the cafe a real Taiwanese cafe feel. At 5pm on a weekday it was pretty empty, but several tables were booked for 7pm. So call and make reservations if you're heading there for dinner!"

Make sure you know how large the crab will be, because I did not know, and it made a big dent on our final tab. We ordered the White Pepper Crab and the Chili Crab. It was my first time with the White Pepper Crab, and I enjoyed that more than the Chili Crab. The Chili Crab here has more of a mala taste to the chili. I also liked dipping the mantou into the White Pepper Crab more. We also got the clams and some veggies. All very tasty and done well. They offer gloves and utensils. Get a coconut as a drink. Our crabs came out to be around 1.5kg. So our check was over $300. One crab is plenty for 3 people, even 4, but we went all out."

It's all about the signature dish here. You can get the classic dish, Singapore Chili Crab, which we did. The also have their own variations. The Green Mumbo was suggested and I must say it's sauce was the best, even better than the classic. Our service was excellent. Explanations and suggestions were generous. One note of caution: pricing. You pay per 100 grams of crab, live weight. The crab is not weighed before you so you don't really know what you are in for as far as the total bill. You are told the crabs range to 1KG and up. At our night, the Green Mumbo was 1.5kg, so 150 Singaporean dollars, or about $120US. But you don't have to get a crab each. If you are just wanting to try the best of Singapore, one crab per table of 4, with plenty of fry bread and other accompaniment should be fine. I strongly recommend the pork belly bits. I know. Shoot me for ordering pork at a seafood restaurant."

I thought it would be a very unique experience, however, it tasted just like a normal curry crab. The crab price is also similar to other top places for seafood. The crab meat was also mediocre, nothing extraordinary nothing bad. The noodles were also mediocre. Strong flavors but nothing special. Clams were average. The vegatable was the best tasting dish of the night and very fresh."

If you're tired of the regular chilli, black pepper, white pepper, salted egg yolk crabs and want to taste a crab for its pure, natural flavour, than Happy Crab should automatically be your #1 choice. I'm giving this place a 5* rating, solely  based on its crabs. Seasoned with just salt and pepper, these crabs are first cooked lightly, then thrown on a charcoal grill to give it that charred BBQ flavour. Mixed in with the natural sweetness, it makes for a killer combination! Ranging from around $35-$40 a crab, these delightful crustaceans will take away whatever craving you have for a good crab because well... They are that good!!Your first bite will bring Michael Buble's ""It's a beautiful day"" floating into your head, and you'd be clapping along to Pharrell William's ""Happy"" halfway through your dinner. The only sad thing about eating here is when you realize that... You're out of crabs! Apart from the crab, the Fried fish is pretty good too and it's sambal is delightful, but... Everything aside, this place definitely THE place to be fore grilled crabs. 2 pincers up for some awesome crabs!"

Not just any rice, Sambal Rice. It's a little spicy so be forewarned.The ambience is nothing to shout about. Kind of looks like your typical Singaporean hole in the wall, but then again that's how you know the food is good.

This place is one of a kind.First off. Grilled crabs. They're grilled till good and charred with salt and pepper. There's a real respect for the natural sweetness of fresh crab, and the combination of flavours won over someone who isn't even that big a fan of crabs. I ate an entire crab by myself. That should tell you something.We also had the best grilled squid I've ever had in Singapore. Grilled with lemon juice, and a little salt and pepper, the squid was tender and delicious. I could have polished off the whole plate by myself, but alas, I had to share.We also had deep-fried ""sand knife"" fish. I believe locally they're also called ""ikan pasir"". Now, as ridiculous as this sounds, I'm not that big a fan of seafood. But these fish. Deep fried. They were meaty, crisp, not oily or fishy in the least. I ate mine, and a third of my friend's. We also had sambal fried rice (excellent wok hei flavour, but not enough sambal), sambal kangkong (wasn't that big a fan of the sambal), and a traditional Teochew dish of cooked leeks with tau kua. The highlight of the meal was what came next. A whole parrot fish, stuffed with fresh chili, wrapped in a banana leaf, and steamed. I think I ate half the entire fish all on my own. I'm a big fan of the clean, fresh heat of chili padi, and the spiciness, combined with the firm, meaty fish was excellent. It wasn't in the least bit fishy, and I found the heat just right to provide that little tingle on the palate, while not overwhelming the flavour of the fish. All in all, I had an excellent meal, and I cannot wait to go back. I'm even bringing my mum, because she's the seafood lover in the family."

The dish came with a chicken wing, a dried fish (mackerel?), an egg, one piece of cucumber, some sambal sauce, and a heap load of rice. The chicken wing tasted old and was not thoroughly cooked. I could not taste the coconut milk and pandan leaf with the rice, as one should with nasi lemak. Overall, a sad meal that was only made slightly better washed down by the Milo Dino drink.

They do not serve beer but one can sit at the Italian restaurant next door for beer and get served food from Tabouleh...

I was expecting to be a little disappointed, but was surprised when it was almost as good as the Lebanese food my family makes. I had a kofta wrap and thought it was delicious - the meat was juicy and flavorful. I had asked for tzatziki on the side instead of hummus, since that's how I usually eat kofta, but was just given yogurt and oil together, without cucumber mixed in. Regardless, it was still a decent side dip and was great with the wrap. My friends shared a cheese manakish, which was decent. I thought it could have had a little more flavor, and prefer thinner dough, but this was still good and reminded me of ones I eat while at home. Overall this is a great place to try if you're looking for Lebanese food!"

Most recently, however, I tried their shish tawouk and was so let down with their portion size. I did get takeaway, so perhaps not indicative of presentation and serving style while dining in, but I received incredibly soggy fries, some smothered in mayo, with a super tiny wrap smushed on top to fit in the otherwise already tiny container. $10 for this was definitely overpriced.The hummus is still always highly regarded, so I will still come back for my tabbouleh desires and try another appetizer when the craving calls."

I had to walk to the back to get the server's attention to take our orders and get our bill.For starters we ordered hummus with some bread on the side; this turned out pretty decently. The hummus portion was generous and we were able to take it home with us.I ordered a chicken shawarma, and my mom, the beef. Portion-wise it was puny, and I found my chicken a bit dry.

Everything tastes good. We prefer Lebanese hummus because it's smooth and creamy.  It's a great value for what you get -- pita comes for free when you order hummus and other appetizer dips so that saves money. I *think* prices are inclusive of GST and service because whenever I get the bill I'm pleasantly surprised.  There aren't so many exotic decorations, and it's fairly simple setting. They stick to good food served fresh: warm dolmas, freshly made pizza-like with lamb, good hummus, etc. You could pay more to get a Middle Eastern ambience with carpets or tiles or fancy decorations, but if you're more interested in getting good solid food with good service at decent prices, this is the place to go."

I grew up eating pho in Canada (both Toronto and Vancouver) where you just cannot miss the numerous pho restaurants dotting the cities. So my standard of good pho is what you get from any pho place in North America. There is just no bad pho over there and it is a staple food in every Vietnamese family there. First off, the chairs are most uncomfortable. The stools are too high for me to eat off the table easily, I felt I was bending over double just to eat, and I am a short person. Then the combination of air conditioning and fan going gives two types of temperature. You get the cool air followed by a blast of warm air, it is most disconcerting. I ordered the sliced beef and brisket pho with extra beef balls. The soup is tasty though I wish it also comes with a side plate of bean sprouts and basil and slice chili and lime for customer to add to it. The meat is terrible. I cannot see or taste the brisket at all, and the meat is very chewy and tough. Such a big disappointment. The beef ball is good though I cannot tell if it is handmade or from a machine. The summer tea takes some getting used to. I will suggest to stick to the Vietnamese coffee or something. The service is good though. Bring cash. I do not remember if it accept NETS. Definitely no credit card facility here. At the moment, I think Pho Tam Anh at Chinatown Point is better for pho."

Service is efficient but they were quite confused with our orders as we constantly placed new orders instead of placing one at one go. I guess they're more used to people who show up to eat and leave, and not us grazing types.The fresh roll is not my favorite but I quite liked the meatballs. They're nice and juicy and come with a delicious dipping sauce. But enough distractions, let me talk about the crab noodles. Unlike pho, they come with mee tai mak which is a kind of short rice noodle and is super slippery and look like little tails. As a result, you have to scoop them up with a spoon, inhaling all that delicious broth along the way. The soup is like a super jazzed up version of pho broth, with all the added umami delightfulness of crab and seafood. The bowl is generously topped with crab & pork meatballs as well as some shrimp. I literally inhaled the entire bowl in one go and had barely anything left for my companions who wanted to try it. Oops.I would go back again just for my favorite crab noodles. I've also tried the bun and pho which are good but ... pale in comparison to those crabby, savory, delicious noodles."

Hailing from Melbourne, with a massive Vietnamese population (and having had two Vietnamese ex-girlfriends!), my judgements of Vietnamese food are always benchmarked against what I've had back home.Which means I'm usually disappointed here in Singapore. We ordered pho special (dac biet), Vietnamese ""Assam laksa"", some goi cuon (fresh rice paper rolls), and a couple of drinks. The goi cuon was good, fresh, with a great sauce. Pho was good - probably best I've had so far in SG - but still not ""Melbourne good"". Of course, it was a damn sight better than the ridiculously overhyped, overrated and overpriced NamNam. It was missing the depth and ""roundness"" of flavour that I love about pho. Generous with meats, though I missed the bits of Vietnamese sausage, tripe and beef tendons that I've come to expect. The Assam laksa was a bit unusual, complex flavours, I wasn't a fan.  Service was good, friendly and fast. $30 for two of us. Tables are literally 4-6 inches apart from each other, so not the most pleasant ambience. Overall worth a try. I just hope people stop going to NamNam."

But people were leaving and we got a table very quickly. Food order is easy - write your own order sheet which is available on the table and then proceed to the counter to place them. Very soon after, our pho arrived. Though I would have preferred to have our starter of papaya salad come first, it came a bit later. We ordered the simple beef pho $7.90, my personal benchmark of a good pho. To be really honest, there was hardly any beefy aroma when the bowl hit the table. Taste wise, brothwas rather mild as well. I am used to a stronger beefy broth and would have liked more than the couple of token mint leaves and herbs to add more aromatics. Oh well. A squirt of hoisin and hot sauce and a squeeze of calamansi lime were added in an attempt to lift up the taste. Better but still short of what is good. Nonetheless I do appreciate this more than Nam Nam's version (which I feel uses lots of artificial seasonings). The papaya salad was very good though! Just papaya, a few shrimps and a good dressing and topping of shredded pork, fried onions and crushed peanuts. $6.50The table for two pax is rather small, given that all the condiments are provided (which is a good thing and convenient) but do take up a bit of space. Our 2 bowls of noodles, 2 drinks and 1 appetizer took up every area."

I've never been disappointed by their bowl, but it's always good to have a backup in case they are closed or when i'm not near the East. So here is another trusted alternative- Mrs Pho. Mrs Pho has been on my food list for a bit because it has been recommended by trusted foodie friends like Miss Tam Chiak and Superfinefeline. So after several half baked attempts to visit (despite being in the area), Jr and i finally dropped by for a taste test.   Standard side order of Goi Cuon ($3.50 for 2). Thin and chewy rice paper rolls filled with rice vermicelli, slices of prawn and pork belly, paired with that 'chee cheong fun' sauce.Now on to the star, their Pho! Have the Pho Bo Tai ($7.90) Sliced Beef Noodle Soup or the Pho Dac Biet ($8.90)- Special Beef Combination Noodle Soup. The former is a no frills bowl that comes with thin and tender beef slices, while the latter has meatballs, brisket, beef, and a half cooked egg. I thought the beef balls were very authentic and indeed they are freshly shipped from Vietnam weekly! As compared to Long Phung, we think that Mrs Pho does a more delicate bowl of noodles with milder flavors. Of course, you can always spice it up with the accompanying fish sauce, lime, and chili. If you are not for beef, there's also Pho Ga ($7.90) Chicken Noodle Soup, and Bun Mam ($8.90) Assam Seafood Noodle Soup. and other vermicelli and rice dishes. Start or end your meal at Mrs Pho with the Iced Ca Phe Sua Da ($3). I thought it was rather smooth and not too sweet really! The Avocado Smoothie ($4.50) was decent too. Now i know where to head to for a perk me up in the Bugis area! A good Ca Phe Sua Da is so hard to come by in Singapore. And of course, the pho. Come here if you can't take Joo Chiat's grittiness, Mrs Pho is definitely more for the young hipsters."

I was greeted with the sound of people slurping their pho and distinctive Vietnamese chatter from the staff....great start....additionally it was 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was packed!Although the pho appears to be the must try, I was craving a rice plate so I went with the Com Suon Cha. Before I even get to the food, I just want to say that I was surprised to see how reasonably priced the items were. Nothing over $8, and the bowls of Pho I see coming out of the kitchen all looked huge. Anyway on to my food, The pork , eggs and the Vietnamese ham combo all blended in real well. Portion was just the right size, you won't come out overly full. I also opted for a fresh spring roll appetizer. I'll have you check out the pictures for yourselves.It was real authentic and took me back to Vietnam and San Jose hahaha. My only complaint....I wish the would add more items as I'm sure Mrs. pho would make them so well!Apart from the food, I liked the decor of the restaurant, very rustic and modern, in keeping with the interior design of most places around Haji lane. I'll definitely come back here and review the Pho!"

A year ago, I would've given it 4 stars, but the standard has dropped. The beef pho, pho ga and bun are just OK (sometimes, the pho broth is tasteless) but it's still better than the overhyped: Nam Nam.Some things never change and those are the starters/sides. The chicken wings, beef balls and fried spring rolls are pretty good and I LURVE the cockles (they say it's fried in garlic but really, it's half a piglet of lard). The fresh spring rolls are hit and miss.  This place can VERY crowded during dinner. Best to go before 7pm. After 8pm, many items might be sold out. Eating there isn't the most comfortable. Chairs are too high for the table so your back will hurt if you linger. And they have this annoying habit of forcing 2 people to sit at two-top even when the restaurant's not crowded. Tables are SMALL. With the sauces, cutlery, pho bowls, side dishes and drinks, you practically need to sit at another table to eat. But hey, rules are rules. Cash only. No booze on the menu but I've seen the owners break out some Tiger around closing!"

It try to emulate street eating in an air-conditioned environment. We do see Vietnamese eating there so it may be more authentic than the other Vietnamese chain stores in the city."

It was also when the staff was eating their lunch made by the kitchen. You know food is good when their own staff eats there. Pho were $7.90 to $8.90 in price and the portions are great.

Also the flavor increased as the steak cooked into the broth. My friend had the spicy beef soup, something I didn't try it but he seemed quite happy. My other friend had the beef noodle stir fry which I did taste and I think it is the best Vietnamese stir fry I have had, which is quite high praise as I would never consider ordering something besides pho at a Vietnamese place until now.

A tip is to ask for extra lashings of basil and mint, essential in making it all come alive.4) Bun Bo Hue ($7.90): a hot and spicy beef noodle soup laden with stewed beef that was so-so, and a fantastic Vietnamese ham5) Bun Bo Xao Sa ($7.90) - chilled rice noodles tossed in a peanut-onion dressing, and topped with beef slices stir-fried with lemongrass: must-try and the best thing here, with its clean and clear and crisp flavours"

The waitresses and waiters are not very experienced but they are very friendly and helpful. We love the beef pho, fresh and fried spring rolls, my sister and her hubby told us the chicken pho and spring roll vermicelli are great too. I think the pork chop rice, chicken wings and meatballs are quite average but my nieces loves them. They also have the best avocado and coconut smoothies.

It took 20 minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited. The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2. The place was packed and the seating was minimal. They were obviously overbooked and unprepared. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. The drink I received from the mixologist was the only bright spot.

Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline.

The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of ""room"", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, ""divided"" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the ""Shakespeare in the Park""-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally ""mixing it up"" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!"

What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the ""heart"" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story ""hidden"" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is."

Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and  Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Crème Brûlée. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves! Bespoke cocktails are priced at $18, and infusion shots at $10."

We nabbed a cozy spot next to the door, with sofas and our back to the wall panelling. It was a pretty interesting place as we had the privilege of looking at the types of people walking in the door. My keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table, and immediately started charging my phone.Coffee was excellent while the Lady Lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations. They have other cake selections on display as well but the selection/names didn't catch my attention.The staff/service is highly commendable. Even though we were seated near the door, the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu.Would definitely be back here again!Tips:- Our seat had 2 socket plugs so internet/phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone- Don't sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke.- If you prefer a cooler, air-conditioned experience, it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe."

Perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of Maison Ikkoku seems to still remain. They do coffee, cocktails and food. The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table. If they would up the service a little bit I would change the rating to a four without a doubt."

It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

The scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that I am going for that combination from here on. The multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat, which was lovely. The guacamole is too awesome for words. I'm not a fan of guacamole but boy did I wipe out all of it this time around.I had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant. The last time I remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at Bowery Street, New York. Desserts is a must.

The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi?

Besides the good food, the coffee here is exceptional. The staff do their best and it's situated in a wonderful area in Singapore, full of culture and atmosphere. Right across the cafe is the Malay Heritage Centre which has a sprawling garden serenely situated within this district. Taking a stroll within the compound after your coffee break at Maison Ikkoku is as simple as walking across. Worth coming here during a lazy afternoon. Just note that weekends are extremely crowded during brunch time and most seats are usually taken up---they take reservations as well but call early!Oh, my recommendation: try their own in-store-crafted Tiramisu cake --- it's delectable and delightful!"

It took 20 minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited. The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2. The place was packed and the seating was minimal. They were obviously overbooked and unprepared. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.

It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of ""room"", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, ""divided"" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the ""Shakespeare in the Park""-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally ""mixing it up"" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!"

What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the ""heart"" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story ""hidden"" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is."

Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and  Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Crème Brûlée. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves!

My keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table, and immediately started charging my phone.Coffee was excellent while the Lady Lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations. They have other cake selections on display as well but the selection/names didn't catch my attention.The staff/service is highly commendable. Even though we were seated near the door, the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu.Would definitely be back here again!Tips:- Our seat had 2 socket plugs so internet/phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone- Don't sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke.- If you prefer a cooler, air-conditioned experience, it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe."

Perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of Maison Ikkoku seems to still remain. They do coffee, cocktails and food. The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table. If they would up the service a little bit I would change the rating to a four without a doubt."

It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

I had the Smoked Salmon Scrambled and the portion was huge enough for 2 to share (well we wanted to share cause we needed to save space for the desserts). The scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that I am going for that combination from here on. The multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat, which was lovely. The guacamole is too awesome for words. I'm not a fan of guacamole but boy did I wipe out all of it this time around.I had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant. The last time I remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at Bowery Street, New York. Desserts is a must. This time around, we went for the rainbow cake (last slice btw!) and it was so good. Not too sweet that it turns you off. It seemed like a mix between a carrot cake and a cheese cake.

However, we were quite lucky - there's still a table for two that's only reserved for 1pm. Since we weren't planning on chatting or taking our sweet time there, we promised we would be in and out before then.I immediately zero-ed in on the Smoked Salmon Omelette ($18), mainly for the chunky guac side, while my sister got Croque Madame ($15)I was pleasantly surprised by the portion. The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi?

What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the ""heart"" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story ""hidden"" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is."

The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of ""room"", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, ""divided"" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the ""Shakespeare in the Park""-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally ""mixing it up"" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!"

Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and  Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Crème Brûlée. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves!

The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table.

Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

The food served is really good and the coffee... oh man that is just the finishing touch on a good brunch. I had the Smoked Salmon Scrambled and the portion was huge enough for 2 to share (well we wanted to share cause we needed to save space for the desserts). The scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that I am going for that combination from here on. The multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat, which was lovely. The guacamole is too awesome for words. I'm not a fan of guacamole but boy did I wipe out all of it this time around.I had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant. The last time I remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at Bowery Street, New York. Desserts is a must. This time around, we went for the rainbow cake (last slice btw!) and it was so good. Not too sweet that it turns you off. It seemed like a mix between a carrot cake and a cheese cake. This place is really good and a must go!"

However, we were quite lucky - there's still a table for two that's only reserved for 1pm. Since we weren't planning on chatting or taking our sweet time there, we promised we would be in and out before then.I immediately zero-ed in on the Smoked Salmon Omelette ($18), mainly for the chunky guac side, while my sister got Croque Madame ($15)I was pleasantly surprised by the portion. The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi?

I could taste the pumpkin though the cheese and the nutty crust. Brilliant! It was however a little too heavy for me towards the end. Well, that's partially my fault for being too greedy anyway.

The drinks are amazing. I think they have a menu - but I always just tell the waiter what I feel like having, ""Something not too sweet, refreshing and strong"", and they'll whip up something for you. Makes it kinda exciting.Their drinks are visually orgasmic - with very elaborate designs, and very artistic interpretations of the traditional cocktail.I had like 8-10 drinks there last Friday, and had a blast.

Enough skill to be worthy of 5*. I'm docking one for high prices and their inability to keep up service quality when the place is full. And somewhat because the location is annoying to get to, as well as being quite nice. None of these (except lack of scalability) is worthy of a star by itself but they add up.The coffee is very, very good. In fact I used to trek there to get my beans because they get the roast amongst the most ""right"" of all the roasters in Singapore. It's a light roast of single origins with very nutty tones (think Colombian) which is perfect for long drinks. Price is in line with hipster coffee places at 7 for a cold drip.The food is best defined as quality tiny portions at exorbitant prices. 18++ for a bit of cheese and 6 crackers is ridiculous! But it's a hip place, the customer base is probably trying to keep under their calorie limits... I try to eat before going there even though it's pretty good stuff. The cocktails are precise and well balanced. What I wonder is how much of that is bartender skill and how much is recipes and good quality control? Nothing wrong with the latter but the prices seem to be marked up to levels implying the former. If Ah Sam can offer bespoke cocktails AND chuck 3 attempts down the drain before offering you something they're happy with, for only 23++, the more than 30 charged by Ikkoku is a bit ridiculous. It's also worth noting that you take a risk by letting them go wild, occasionally you get a dud (our berry mojito was not that different from a dragonfruit flavour vitaminwater) - but that's part of the game. No risk no gain. I do wonder what the ice is made of. The smell of the water from the melting ice definitely reminded me of MacRitchie reservoir. Again, at that price point I'd expect using something other than tap water in delicately balanced cocktails (or at least filter it). What annoyed me is that I once asked for a variation on a classic cocktail (instead of sticking with giving them a mood and getting something ""created"") and they made a bit of a fuss about it, implying I didn't trust them or something. On the contrary, a true artist works best within constraints (cf what Helmut Newton's ""victims"" said of sessions with him, which were dictatorial). A classic sour, for example, is all about balancing the sour, sweet and booze taste-wise and texturally, the egg white (which they did impeccably). A sazerac is the hardest of all as too much absinthe results in basically an aniseed short drink, and too little and you have something resembling an Old Fashioned. The location is alright, sandwiched between shophouses and with a magnificent view from the garden over the Sultan Mosque which has just been renovated. Bit far from public transport by foot.On a normal (i.e. not full) day, the prices are somewhat justified by the competent and personalized service and peaceful interior. Then we made the mistake of coming on the Chillax anniversary night where something like 500 Amex card holders poured onto a small number of bars to test the resilience and scalability of the teams on duty that night. Once we got there and somehow secured a table, the team cranked up the music to painful levels (to stop people lingering and clear space for more of the mobs?) so much so that we on outside tables kept closing the door to try and preserve our eardrums. It then took them 10 minutes to take our order and around 1h10 to deliver the cocktails. This is the downside of hand crafting every order, scalability is almost impossible. We moved on to Auld Alliance which had no issue with the Chillax crowds, thanks to having both ample amounts of staff at hand and serving whisky instead of cocktails, which take less effort to serve. If Chillax had been my only experience of Ikkoku, I'd never come back.The thing is, at this price point, I don't bother going to Ikkoku anymore anyway. Sure it's good, but the stack of small risks and issues just make it hard to find the willpower to make the effort, particularly if the night will be crowded. There's plenty of competition in town..."

They have a great ambience and your tables are made out of old recycled doors or cupboard doors. Old shelves are also nailed to the celing, giving a vey odd impression that they are falling through the ceiling somehow!The coffee here is fantastic. I always order the latte, or the MI Signature latte. They use a fragrant blend of beans that I can enjoy without sugar. For those who aren't crazy about coffee, you can also order the chai tea, which I find good, but a little too sweet for my palate.The cakes here are also worth mentioning. My favourites were the pumpkin cheese cake, which was light and not too heavy, and the red velvet cake topped with cream cheese icing, walnuts and comes in a gloriously large slice.They have great sandwiches here at affordable rates. I found them so big, a friend and I could share one. They use good, freshly baked bread, and quality ingredients for their sandwiches.I've also tried the eggs benedict on their weekend brunch menu, and enjoyed it. I will definitely head back to try their other coffees and dishes!It's mostly street parking around here, so good luck at peak hours! This area is also notorious for the summons people loitering about and giving tickets, so it's best not to risk an illegal park.

Usually watery, tepid, and bitter. Mostly, I got comfortable with the kopi houses all over singapore for my caffeine fix. It's a very different kind of drink, but once you get used to it, I found it to be a better option than the other coffee available.Anyway, back to Maison Ikkuku. This is the place I visit on the weekend, when I want to have a real coffee. Fresh ground beans, well roasted, and made properly with a decent espresso machine operated by people that know what they're doing. Best coffee I've had in Singapore.

I enjoy telling them one or two key ingredients or taste, let them mix a cocktail, and be surprised. Of course, you can always try their more popular drinks. The bloody mary is one of the best in town. So are the smoked whiskey & chili drinks. The service is great. Everyone is cheerful and friendly. The vibe is uplifting, cosy for a group of friends to hang out or catch up. My only pet peeve is no reservations after 9.30pm but I do understand their point of view.

For the first time in Singapore, I had a version of spam musubi with REAL SPAM...at $3, it was a bit overpriced for its small size, but it satisfied my craving (the few places that sold musubi used generic spam). My caramel latte was much better than I expected...not too sweet but the coffee was strong and flavorful -- definitely not your average brucnh latte. Our friends ordered a side of potatoes and it was a lot smaller than we expected -- it came in the same sauce-like container the guacamole came in...it made the musubi for $3 look like a good deal haha.

It took 20 minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited. The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2.

Get Welly to pour you a signature MI Latte - he's pretty good. Heck, even the chef's a bit of a barista himself! Oh and the food's pretty good too. Try the weekend brunches. Or grab a musubi if you're in a hurry (spam on sushi rice? yeah.)Second level houses a menswear boutique. Cult brands, decent selection. I've been making eyes at some Miansai accessories for ages... picked up some Twins for Peace shoes instead. #firstworldproblemsTop floor is a boutique cocktail bar. Now if you remember a mixologist called Leslie who used to be at another bar a couple streets away... I found him. He's a smooth operator, and he's got a wealth of experience.

It's probably the only place of its kind in that enclave. I was looking for a good coffee boost but didn't want to have turkish coffee so my friend brought me to this place, it's along the row of shophouses just opposite the malay heritage centre. It's got a very welcoming cozy vibe - the kind that invites you to just hang out here for hours. I ordered an iced latte (loved how it was served in a generous portion of a jar!) and had a red velvet. Indeed I got the coffee boost I wanted and more! The coffee was beautifully prepared, with alot of love. The red velvet was a nice accompaniment though it was quite a huge slice that I couldn't finish it.Haven't been to the other floors of this place but definitely have become enough of a fan of the cafe to check the rest of the place out!Final verdict: A good break from middle eastern food and atmosphere of arab st!"

On a quiet side street, the calm of a quiet Saturday afternoon is broken by the hum of conversation and the hiss of milk being steamed under pressure. The painted brick walls with industrial style copper pipes and light fixtures are far removed from the original shophouse that was here, and are closer to a contemporary urban studio apartment. There are some quirky touches also, with old pieces of furniture suspended from the walls, and doors recycled into tables on an outdoor terrace.An espresso shot is the foundation of many different coffees. It's hard to make a bad drink with a good espresso, and so much easier to make a bad drink with an over extracted shot. The espresso shot that I ordered arrived with a medium dark brown crema, and a small volume of coffee. (The crema colour is an indicator of freshness. If it's pale, it's stale, which is why I always make a note of this. The small volume suggests that the shot was not over extracted, which would give rise to unpleasant flavours in the shot, as non soluble coffee grounds end up in the cup). It was bitter, with hints of woody flavours, and a slightly thick mouthfeel. The aftertaste was bold and lasting - overall a well executed espresso. So far, so good. I ordered a latte also. The espresso was definitely muted by the milk. It was smooth, with the coffee flavour not lost or drowned out by the milk. However, the overall quality is reduced by the presence of larger bubbles in the milk foam - this is something that I have seen before in Maison Ikkoku. This might seem like the most minor and insignificant point imaginable, but there are valid underlying reasons for pointing this out. Larger bubbles do not impart the same silky smooth mouthfeel that microfoam does. Also, the baristas have gone to the effort of creating latte art. Unfortunately, larger bubbles cause the foam to break apart, so the overall affect is lost after a few minutes. This is something that is fixable, and it's a shame to see their efforts go to waste for the sake of a small change to the steaming technique. It's also the difference between a very good latte, and an average one. One thing to bear in mind however - the point above is simply not relevant for anyone who prefers drip or brewed coffee, and might not even be an issue for anyone else.  There is also a good selection of brewed and drip coffees available for anyone with different tastes. Pourover coffees are on the menu, along with cold dripped, syphon, aeropress, andV60 all available as options. Coffee choices include pretty much everything except ristretto shots. That's ok though, there's more than enough on offer. One thing that Maison Ikkoku does well is the pairing of different bean types to different brewing methods, and the baristas are well versed in which method to pair to which bean. This is great to see, and speaks volumes about the cafe, and the owners intentions and reasons for starting. Prices as are expected - $8.50 for the latte and cappuccino above - and broadly in line with what is charged in other quality cafes. Along with Smitten and Chye Seng Huat Hardware, Maison Ikkoku has a very well stocked retail section, with accessories that are not always found elsewhere. There is a good selection of items for brewed or filtered coffees, including Chemex and V60 coffee drippers, cone filters and syphons. There are also tampers on sale for home baristas. Unfortunately, Maison Ikkoku does not sell coffee beans. This is something that I would like to see happen, as there are some interesting blends and single origins  from Columbia and El Salvador being used. Overall, 4 stars, as the selection of brewing methods available, and the quality of espresso, makes up for the steaming issue described above (which will not affect everyone), but it's unfortunate to see this when everything else is done so well. Also, Maison Ikkoku can be very crowded at weekends, with queues for seats - opening the second floor cocktail bar during the day would help to alleviate this. It's certainly worth a visit, and along with Symmetry and EspressoLab, is a good choice for anyone craving caffeine in the Arab Street area."

Boutique - Great Japanese brands, mostly for men.  Bought a few things, decent options and easy to chat with staff.  Great way kill time while waiting for a table.  Bar - Friendly (and skilled) bartender, tasty tasty drinks. 2nd favorite cocktail bar in Singapore (Tippling Club reigns as #1, no surprise there).  The bad: Cafe - Food has taken a nosedive since opening. Change in chef/recipe?  Something is off, because before it was the best eggs benedict and now it's just average. Tiramisu is to die for, literally.  Gave me and my friend a stomach ache. Always crowded, so be prepared to wait.Boutique - Would love more options/sizes. Bar - A bit too congested and pricey. Need cheap/beer options.  Haven't been in awhile, I hope they added a free/self serve water option because it wasn't there before.  The ugly: If the drop in food quality is any indication, this could be one of those great venues that gets popular and forgets about the little things that made it so. I'm optimistic though because it seems that the staff actually cares."

Its one of those, don't have a menu but tell me what you want type of speakeasy-ish bars. while the decor isn't that of a speakeasy - the drinks are the classy types that reminds you of one. Try to go early on a random week day to get a seat at the bar, so you can see the amount of care and skill that goes into each drink. I love watching the mixologist (okay, NOT just ""bartenders"", but this is some classy stuff - so ""mixologists"" it is) going at it with each drink, pounding away on the berries/cucumbers for super fresh flavors, slapping the mint (NOT just ripping it up like how ppl usually do, but SLAPPING it), and lighting up rosemary on fire for extra flavoring and a show. drinks are amazing here - the only time i've had to have something re-done was for Maison's version of a bloody mary, it wasn't that it was bad, but it was just too spicy. overall - i always have a great time here, chill vibe, classy music and decor, and most importantly, each drink makes me feel so special.

It almost had a nutty flavor. I'm guessing it's the way they roast the beans.  They also are hitting on the trend of offering a ton of different coffee preparation styles: French press, vacuum, whatever.  C's coffee was superb.  The only downside to this fabulous little eatery is that we felt bad holding the table so we quickly sipped our coffee and skedaddled.  I'm totally going back next weekend."

We had the jumbo prawn mee with soup, no bean sprouts.  The soup was tasty but not as flavorful as I expected, can be better.  The jumbo prawns are jumbo but somehow the prawns are also not as tasty as it can be.  But compared with other prawn noodles I have tried here so far, it is indeed the best one.  At 8.80 for a small bowl, I thought it is a bit overpriced?

Likewise, the price ranges from 3 dollars for a small portion of sliced prawn mee to 10+ for the jumbo prawn mee. Upon ordering, one can choose the spicy or non-spicy version. Personally, the spicy version is preferred as it provides a nice kick when drinking the broth at the end of the meal. The prawn and noodles were cooked nicely, no hard and overcooked prawns. But the real deal lies in the prawn broth which one can get free refills of. The broth haste a strong prawn taste fragrance that left a sweet after-taste. Do note that one will have to park further away and walk to the stall as the stall is located facing the road. Finally, the stall opens till 4pm daily, hence do expect to have it only for lunch and tea-time meals."

The secret's in the soup- its a robust, aromatic soup thick with pork and prawn essence. a soup like that probably was boiled The ingredients like the prawns and pork ribs are pretty decent.Oh and theres a terrific ngoh hiang (fried food assortment)!Parking's difficult around this area, try to take public transport/taxi if possible."

LOL!  Regardless....OUR MEAL WAS DELICIOUS!  Maybe because we have tastebuds for food like this because we grew up around Mexican food or the like living in Southern Nevada or maybe because this was an unexpected gem in a sea of Asian cuisine in this region of the world, but this was a great experience and a fantastic meal. We asked for their ""top selling suggestions"" from our waiter and ended up with the following at our table: 1)Tono Ceviche - an unexpected twist to what I would normally expect when I order a ceviche with baby calamari and beet root paste. 2). Mariscos - this was a savory, minimally salty, delicious rice dish with fresh seafood. 3). Salmon - raw fresh salmon with a pop of unexpected Peruvian flavor (ordered from their Daily board)4) Pisco Sour & Chilcano - two great custom cocktails!  Refreshing, light ceviches, remarkable flavors.    My husband and I shared all items in order to try everything.  Most items are priced between $25-$30SGD each and designed to share and explore (although potions not gigantic or anything).  We loved everything about this place.  Decor, design, Britto artwork, delicious unique food for Singapore.  WE CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!"

Given our love for raw fish (just look at the number of sushi and sashimi restaurants, plus the recent poke craze), i'm surprised it's taking so long for ceviche to take off! TONO Cevicheria is also Asia's first-ever Peruvian Cevicheria opened by Peruvian Chef Daniel Chavez, co-owner and chef of OLA Cocina del Mar. Expect authentic flavors and strong Pisco Sour from the team of Lima-trained Latin American chefs.If you're wondering what Peruvian food is like, well... It's kinda fusion, with influence from the Incans, Spanish, Africans, Italians, Chinese, and Japanese. We can see a mix of all flavors in their national dish, the ceviche. (I'm just making this up, there isn't a national dish but if there should be one, it has to be ceviche.) At TONO, there are a few types of ceviche to pick from. Starting with my favorite Tono Ceviche ($28). This mild but balanced dish uses an interesting tiger's milk which features charred ginger, and smoked aji amarillo (peppers) among the typical citrus-fish jus. Plus there's an added crunch from the crispy baby calamari to go with the fresh fish.If you want something to kick start your appetite, the Nikkei Ceviche ($24) is a tart Japanese style yellowfin tuna salad with a soy, mirin, hondashi tiger's milk. There's a lot of lime in this one! There is some avocado puree with the dish but i couldn't detect much of it due to the overwhelming acidity.Another Japanese inspired dish is the Yellow Pituco Tiraditos ($24). The yellowfin tuna is sliced thinly in this one (almost carpaccio style), and dressed with chilli vinaigrette and some cream sauce. The spiciness is one that will take you by surprise and give you a hacking cough (like that when you choke on ma la). The garnishes depends on chef's mood for the day and we had radishes, crispy quinoa and plantain chips on ours.Fun fact of the day. There are more than 4000 varieties of potatoes in Peru. Well we only had 1 type in the Escabeche causa ($22) which is served with 2 types of chicken (chicken shreds mixed with mayo, and grilled chicken with panca chilli sauce) served with potato mash and escabeche sauce. The piquant sauce is made with fresh peppers and aji panca (dried red peppers), garlic, tomatoes and onions, with chicken stock. The aji panca gives the dish a light smokiness.Skip the Jalea ($32), which is essentially a crispy seafood platter with tapioca chips, salsa criolla and smoked chili mayo. It's not that it's not nice, it's just that there's nothing special about it. Plus we can always get more interesting seafood elsewhere in Singapore.Same goes for the Lomo Saltado ($40), a Chinese influenced stir-fried beef with red wine vinegar and the other typical Chinese aromatics. As with their Chi-Fa (Peruvian Chinese food stalls), this is served with french fries and rice. My take? I'd have the authentic Chinese stir-fry. Anticuchos (chicken or beef, $22/25) are meat skewers which have been marinated in a mix of red wine vinegar and aji panca before being seared on a plancha. It is served with a Chalaquita sauce made with a little tomato, pepper, onions and white tiger's milk (used in ceviche clasico). The beef was more juicy than the chicken skewers. Peruvian meat dishes, actually most dishes, have varying degrees of sourness. It's appetizing at the start but sometimes you just want something heavy to anchor the meal. Thankfully we had the Arroz con Mariscos ($34) a seafood rice with crabmeat, fish, prawns, and calamari in aji panca, aji amarillo and achiote oil base. Long grain rice is used here and provides more bite. The seafood remained succulent as they areseared separately before being folded into the rice. Peruvians love their sweets and i had too many alfajores con dulce de leche when I was in Peru but these Alfajores ($12) at TONO are way better! The light butter cookies with dulce de leche and mango mousse simply disintegrates into powder when you bite into them. The dulce de leche is housemade, as is the mango mousse. Both are delightful without being cloying.More rice for desserts? Sure if it's Combinado ($12), a comforting spiced vanilla rice pudding and purple corn Mazamora. The rice pudding is made of bomba rice cooked with milk, cream, sugar, orange peel and vanilla, with coconut puree added at the very end. While the purple Maxamora syrup may look strange, it's made with Christmasy ingredients like star anise, apples, and quince, along with pineapple skin and purple corn."

The space wasn't crowded and we could enjoy lunch at a leisurely pace. The buffet was mostly focused on local cuisine.  The cold bar involves a selection of greens to build your salad plus a sampling of seafood. No sashimi but you can build a cold platter of prawns, crawfish, mussels, and clams. The warm food ranged from local faves like carrot cake and otak. Also includes a range of Chinese and Indian dishes like bok choy with goji berries and lamb curry. Carving station for roast beef as well as a made-to-order laksa station where the broth was surprisingly more lemak and tasty than it looked. Dessert included fruits and a nice selection of local nonya kuehs. Pair the sweet Kueh Dadar with coffee from the espresso machine and it's a nice way to finish the meal. Folks are friendly and attentive. Perhaps pricey at the full price but very reasonable with discounts from places like eatigo. Ginger is not a fancy buffet but more than does the trick for variety."
