Once inside, the decor is good enough. The beer list is fairly long and they do offer ""sampler sets"" but they are large 6-8oz pours at S$14 per set. They definitely should make them smaller and perhaps offer a set of five. Just a better business model I've seen work some many other paces. The food was fine. They definitely specialize in beef and the proportions to price were less than appealing. While understanding Singapura is expensive, it seemed a bit overpriced for the ambiance (or lack there of), while watching patrons from a nearby gym club swim in the pool just on the other side of the windows. Definitely a step down from their previous location in/near Katong. While I wasn't aware of them there, it seems like it was a much better location for attracting customers. Oh well."

The toppings were great, it's good to see places take risks with a bit unconventional toppings.  The only thing lacking was the sourdough crust.. it was a tad undercooked. For a pizza oven, it probably meant spending just 30 seconds to a min longer in the oven. APart from that.. its a decent pizza place."

You can't go wrong with Brewerkz located in the middle of Sentosa Boardwalk.We chanced upon it while walking back to mainland after a day in USS. Despite my headache, I agreed to 'seize the moment' and stayed in to have a few beers and snacks. The drinks were the same as you would get in bars anywhere else and not exceptional (about 16 for a beer), though some of them are from their own microbrewery. The snacks were also unexceptional but definitely satisfactory. The onion rings were $9 for a fairly large basket, and desserts of brownie with ice cream and bread pudding with ice cream were $10 each with equally decent portions. The best part is the view, which is really what you're paying for. The sparkling lights on the floor to mimick the night sky above coupled with the serenity of the sea and the distant twinkling of the cable car lights was a simply divine combination. At 9pm, we were unexpectedly treated to some sort of light show in the distance of a floating platform in front of Sentosa. I'm guessing many already know about this but it looks like two birds fighting and ended off with loads of water, light and fireworks. From our location, it was perfect, not too loud or crowded, and with the soft backdrop of the bar music. We had actually just paid and were about to leave for the bus home but were mesmerised by the fireworks and abstract lights.This is a very romantic location to bring a date, or just a laid-back environment to chill with friends."

They use real charcoal so you get a much better flavor than with a gas grill. And they cook the meat for you! For six people, we ordered:1. Thin-sliced brisket (WooSamYeop) 28 SGD x 2. Would definitely order this again, and again and again. The brisket was subtly marinated and cooked to crisp perfection. 2. Yangnyum Galbi 45 SGD x 2. Would also order this again. It was a fantastic flavor. 3. Marinated pork belly (Mansinchang) 25 SGD. Also delicious4. Premium beef (Ggot Sal) 38 SGD. Again, very tasty. I found this and the Galbi to be pretty interchangeable?5. Jap Chae 23 SGD. Christian loved this dish. I think he finished it single-handedly. 6. Dolsot Bibimbap 15. Very reasonable price for dolsot bibimbap, but an uninspired interpretation. 7. Seafood Pancake (Haemul Pajeon) 22 SGD. Much eggier than the versions that I'm used to. I didn't really like this and wouldn't order it again. 8. Sundubu Jigae 18 SGD. We barely touched this and I definitely wouldn't order it again.There's not a wide variety of banchan, but you get a lot of veggies. Next time, I would weigh much more heavily towards meat."

I love beef but for most of my friends who can't eat beef for religious purpose, it's a bummer. It's been a while since I've been here but since I was in the vicinity and craving army stew for a long while, we decided to head over there.Verdict:- Army stew (contains beef broth and pork) - This is delicious except that I found the soup abit lacking in taste, to which I added some soyabean chili paste. Yum! The stag will thoughtfully put a pot of soup on your table in case you need to top up the soup, which gets thicker and spicier as it boils.  - Woo Samgyup - This is their trademark beef with marinated sauce. Guess the trademark comes from the secret sauce recipe. The beef is tender and juicy yet thin. It's like shabu beef on grill! - Pork belly grill - This is awesome as always; well marinated. But I found the fats pretty daunting so I stuck mostly to the beef! Total bill came up to $100 exact! How often is it you get a whole, round number? :) All in all, I was amazed that the staff grilled the meat for you which could be a Singapore thing. However, if you go to other korean restaurants at Tanjong Pagar, some of them let you grill the meat yourself. That's the fun part I feel!Tip: Go there early for dinner as the dinner crowd starts streaming in from 630pm. I was there at 530pm and got a nice seat quickly."

The meat was amazing and when I wrapped it in lettuce with a bit of shaved green onions and sauce it was even better. This was my first time having Woo Samgyup, and I have to say that I will definitely have it again. The only thing is that aside from cooking for you at your table, the servers don't really stop by to check up on you."

The waitress cooked the meat, so we dont have a chance to slow down our eating speed, and i wasnt allowed to put garlic on top of the grill. Sad! I love eating meat with grilled garlic.

When I saw the long queue outside and the abundance of tables inside when I enter, I was surprised and thought it must be an awesome marketing strategy! To make you feel like it's very popular!But I can't blame them, during our meals, the servers have been very dedicated to help us grill our meats that they are probably quite shorthanded.Service-wise, their servers literally stood beside my table and cooked the meat well for us, leaving us to fully enjoy our meal. Tea however was often not refilled, and I don't like that they use plastic containers for the tea. As for the food, the kimchi soup is nice and authentic, but a little too spicy for me. For each time we visit, always loved them serving the long row of vegetables that are so fresh, crunchy and so... green!Each time, I ordered only two sets of meat for two persons to share and couldn't finish it. Tried their five spices marinated meat, pork belly, the first page highly recommended beef and the premium beef set.

Located at the basement of Vivocity Mall, this branch of the ever popular Akashi chain of restaurants possibly has the best location out of all the Akashi restaurants. It is easily accessible because of the Harbour Front MRT station, and being located in a mall by the sea allows one to take slow leisurely walks to fend off the post dinner coma. The sashimi here is cut lusciously thick; the katsu is addictively crispy on the outside, and sits on a bed of fluffy white rice. Prices are pretty reasonable too, as with all Akashi restaurants. I recommend calling ahead though, because this branch can get quite crowded at dinner time."

He also enjoyed the Sweet potato fries that accompanied the burger! Honey Baby Back Ribs - my FIL enjoyed his the most he declared. I tried a bite and the meat was moist yet falls-off-bone tender. Seasoning also on point. Mad about Salmon - MIL said it's nice. Salmon meat was not dry and Rosti was great too. Beef Mac & Cheese - daughter didn't like the shell pasta but she still polished the whole tray of baked pasta! Haha... the sauce base is tomato with cheese over it. Think it's more lasagna than Mac & Cheese really. BBQ Cheeseburger - this should be good because my 8 year old ate the WHOLE burger unassisted!

Being established in 1977, they are located at Keppel Road, sitting on top of a grain silo, serving Beijing Cuisine as well as dim sum for lunch. Having visited 4-5 times here on Business Agenda, this place and her food had never failed to entice me.Locating the restaurant may be a little tricky as a miss in a turn will make you go a big round to locate it. Since its located within Prima's premises, parking lots are rather limited. However, valet services are provided for diner, thus one do not have to get stress out of parking lots.Once entering the lobby area, diners have to take the lift up followed by a flight of winding stairs to reach the 11th floor then escalator. Interior is in line with the old school traditional vibe with rosewood furnishing, fish tank, round tables with lazy Suzy and square tables. Atmosphere is like tuning into a time machine, going back in time into 1980s.The entire one round of revolution takes about an hour and of course the best seats are by the side of the windows offering a panoramic view to the surroundings to the PSA and Sentosa Island.On our visit, we had the Menu 5 for 6 persons instead of ala carte.Shredded Scallops with Fish & Egg White is one of Prima Tower's Signatures. The dish was served with ingredients segregated, thereafter the server will perform the mixture of egg, egg white, fish and scallops in front of us.Shredded Scallops with Fish & Egg White 赛螃蟹Despite of the dish name in Mandarin that mentioned crab, there was no sign of crab as an ingredient. The combination of ingredients blend well into one another which is sweet and delighting to our palates, very suitable to start off our meals like this. To enjoy this starting dish, add some black vinegar and pepper for taste.2nd dish on the menu was Fish Maw and Seafood in Thick Soup. Similar to the 1st Dish, we added vinegar and pepper for taste. The serving is prepared in personal potand the thick soup too, was fresh and refreshing.Fish Maw & Seafood in Thick Soup 鱼鳔海鲜羹The legendary Chinese Dish - the Peking Duck. Glistering Peking Duck will be parked by a side on a trolley waiting to be carved by the skillful waitress / waiter. If you are wondering where does the rest of the meat gone to after having its skin encased in the egg wrap. Well, the meat can be used as ingredients for other dishes such as fried rice.Authentic Barbecued Peking Duck 烤北京填鸭We have ordered egg wraps and staff will fill the wrap with the crispy duck skin, spring onion and bean sauce.Soon Hock Fish was served in Teochew style with light and tasty broth. The meat was tender and topped with garnishing like coriander and chilli stripes.Steamed Soon Hock in Teochew Style 潮式蒸顺壳Another dish that struck me by surprise will be their stewed pork ribs that was served separately with buns. In Dialect, Hokkien language, we called this ""Kong Bak"" where by this braised meat was sandwich in between the pieces of fluffy buns. In this case, its more of pull pork. The meat was fork tender and easily fell off with little force asserted.Stewed Pork Ribs (Served with Buns) 京烤骨皇 （代花卷）These pork meat was very flavorful in its generous serving of braised sauce with a few stalks of coriander to enhance its taste. Having said that, the pork was not greasy at all.The buns that come in a set with the Stewed Pork are fluffy and looked different from the usual ""flat pouches"" kind of bun we had from else where. Instead, these came in shapes and had some lines patterns on the surface.Soup was sweet and delighting with Chinese spinach, shredded scallops, wolf berries in superior broth.Chinese Spinach with Shredded Scallops, Wolfberry & Whole Garlic in Superior Broth上汤蒜子干贝杞子灼苋菜An ending surprise with souffle balls encased with red bean stuffing. Even though it was fried, exterior was not greasy and amazingly soft. Initially we thought desserts was fish balls but the skin was soft, taste of egg white and chewy.Souffle Balls with Red Bean Stuffing 高丽豆沙I love its texture, also given that the red bean stuffing was not too sweet.And just this month, we visited in smaller group and ordered Menu 4.Menu 4A popular delicacy in a Chinese restaurant whereby sharkfin was flavored in stock. Soup was great with ingredients like Fish Maw, crab meat, fish and chicken.Braised Shark Fin Soup with Seafood 海鲜鱼翅Enhance the taste of the delicacy by adding black vinegar and pepper."

There's a current Peking duck and seafood special that is a really great deal at just $288 nett for 10 persons. Really enjoyed the shredded scallop and fish in egg egg whites. It was just so delicate and light but you got the full flavor of the seafood. Same applies to the broccoli & crab dish. The fish maw & seafood soup, the Peking duck, and the  sea bass were pretty good too. I found the stewed pork to be on the fatty side and didn't really care for the jelly desert. Still all in all, it was a very delicious meal and since we added some dim sum to the menu, we were stuffed and satisfied. Service is efficient albeit a little curt. Still, you get lovely views of the city as you go through your meal and that compensates for a lot.

At 37 years old, Prima might be the oldest revolving restaurant in Singapore. It is also, according to them, the only revolving restaurant situated on top of grain silos in the world. It's a good thing I only read that after lunch because under the right conditions, flour can act like explosives. Erm. Right. On to the important stuff--does it revolve? Yes! So you get a nice view of Sentosa-Keppel-Mount Faber-Telok Blangah and back again. It moves slowly, say 30min for one full rotation, so unless you're very sensitive no one will lose their lunch. Today being a public holiday they were full house for lunch; I heard that this place usually serves the lunch crowd, but best to call ahead in any case. We had the set menu (which was on promotion) so it worked out to under $30/pax, including the nommy Peking duck. Many other families also thought it was good value and ordered that; however, Prima also has an extensive dim sum menu that other tables were ordering from. I am going to return to try that out! Food was tasty (Beijing cuisine, the menu said; old-time flavours, the aunties said. ), service was prompt (never had to prompt for tea, food came out at a comfortable pace, only had to wait for dessert but that was when they were at their fullest). So. Yes. Come for the novelty, and enjoy a good meal with it!"

It is pretty easy to get a reservation on Chope, or even as a simple walk-in on a busy Friday night in Sentosa.My first impression was thinking...this is definitely one of the least attractive spaces to label as a Michelin Star (that is, one that isn't a hawker). It looked like a normal cafe with an identity conflict being casual vs dressy. However, my mind changed pretty quickly when I encountered the impeccable service from the very beginning. The hostesses are amongst the kindest and most professional I've ever come across in ANY restaurant. I was quickly seated and provided the giant one page menu and their drink menu which was mostly French and Australian wines, with a lacking cocktail menu. The wine sommelier (quite a young sommelier for a Michelin Star restaurant) assisted me in selecting a bottle of Australian Shiraz which was actually also their house Shiraz and quite good. I ordered the following:1) Truffled Kalamata Olive Flatbread - They served this with a Pistachio butter that came in what looked like a toothpaste tube which was slightly unattractive. The flatbread was a nice starter.2) I unfortunately don't remember which steak I ordered but it was the recommended Australian steak. It definitely was not presented well but had a great flavor that I truly enjoyed. They give you two small beakers with a sesame sauce and some other sauce that you can play with along with three side garnishes to enjoy. The meat was extremely soft and flavorful.3) Hot Chocolate Soup for dessert - This was their recommended dessert but I can't understand why. You are literally served a cup of hot chocolate sauce (similar to the lava from a Chocolate Lava Cake) and a cup of vanilla ice cream. That's it. It's as if I was drinking a rich hot chocolate with a side of vanilla ice cream. Very unoriginal and I felt ripped off by this.Frankly, although this restaurant had good flavors and solid service, I scratch my head thinking how this was awarded a Michelin Star. CUT at Marina Bay Sands is lightyears ahead of OSIA (my opinion) with regards to flavor, drinks, wine, ambiance, everything and that is what you would actually be comparing in the same category. Michelin aside, it's good although not entirely memorable.However, if you are on a Michelin Star hunt, extremely hungry for steak and stuck in Sentosa, then I would definitely recommend OSIA."

It's a good starter for those with smaller appetites, because it leaves space for the heavier stuff.We also shared a seafood platter; grilled octopus, King prawns, scallops, a half lobster, and a small bowl of clams in white wine. They paired it with a side of hollandaise sauce & cocktail shrimp sauce, which were both really good!For desert we had the macadamia soufflé - the portion was huge, and it was really tasty!

Fresh, clean flavours abound, and cooking styles were deliberately kept delicate. Perhaps it's the lack of a dining crowd during lunchtimes, but Osia's set lunch menu, at only $45 for a 3-course set ($35 for 2-courses), is probably one of the most value-for-money ever. A competitively priced set lunch in order to draw in the customers, I supposeService was excellent at Osia. I'd gotten terribly lost in the labyrinth of a carpark and was an angry mess by the time I arrived at the restaurant, but the waiter was so empathetic, so cheery, downright nice, that it wasn't long before I cooled down. And despite a couple of serious cock-ups (the restaurant's power tripped which caused the credit card facilities to fail, so after 20 minutes of trying to swipe our cards, we were then told that only cash was accepted, and there was this faint stench of the sewage that reeked through the restaurant towards the end of the lunch dining hour), service recovery was fantastic. Apologies were profuse and sincere, and reparation efforts were made to provide us a better dining experience by way of a discounted return visit. We had:1) Mixed Flatbread ($11), a chewy confection burnished half with Truffled Kalamata Olives and the other half with Macadamia Pesto.2) A starting option on the set lunch menu, the Black Angus Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio, dusted with dukkah spice and topped with creamy egg mayonnaise: scrumptious.3) Cardamom Citrus-Cured Yellowtail Amberjack: another starter, crisp and refreshing, complemented by the mild sweetness of fennel and the fruity bite of a thick orange-ginger foam.4) Pan-Fried Foie Gras (supplement $12): a stellar mainstay in their rotating stable of appetizers. The melty richness of the liver was balanced with a whipped light-as-air banana mash, Jamaican rum and Madagascar vanilla.5) Onto the mains, the Chicken Leg Confit: set atop a velvety garlic potato mash, slathered in a luscious red wine sauce, and contrasted with the subtle bitterness of charred radicchio.6) Braised Compressed Oxtail: fork-tender, and laden with ratatouille and blanketed in a caramelized onion puree and robust red wine sauce.7) For a lighter entree, the flaky Grilled Perch, stewed with boiled potato and fennel in a tomato fish broth, was flavourful and exquisite. This was served in an earthernware and then ladled onto a bowl for consumption.8) For dessert, there was just the one option of a sublime Valrhona Hot Chocolate Soup with black pepper-spiked vanilla ice-cream and sesame crisp. Great textures and wonderfully balanced"

First there's the reintroduction of the weekend lunches at Joel Robuchon restaurants. Then this weekend, Celebrity Chef Andrew Turner of Hotel Café Royal in London is presenting his specially created dishes (13 to 16 May) alongside resident Chef Scott Webster.We started our set dinner with some Stone Hearth Flat Bread served with extra virgin olive oil, butter and dip. Truffled Kalamata Olive and Macadamia Pesto are the hot favorites here and i enjoyed the fluffy hot bread when it was first served. Osia's Char Grilled Fremantle Octopus with cucumber apple slaw and green chili jam failed to impress with its rubbery texture.  Osia won me back with their Pan fried Foie Gras by with textures of banana (in espuma and caramelized form), Madagascar vanilla and Jamaican rum. It's a first having bananas paired with foie gras and it was surprisingly a good match due to the savory and salty caramelized bananas. The signature Osia dish is the Perch with sesame ratte potato, pea tendril, soy milk curd and a shiromiso glaze. Light tasting dish with a little sweetness from the miso."

The expectations are met for a good restaurant, but does not have the makings of an excellent one, we did not walk away wow-ed by the food. Our experience was marred by the inability of the wait staff to execute their duties with pride. They were malaise, and at time downright condescending and rude in their communication with us. Unfortunately, this was the case for 3 of the 4 wait staff we encountered. Despite an empty restaurant (only 3 other tables were occupied) and four wait staff loitering the area, the front of house was at a total loss. No one filled our water. We mentioned that we wanted wine with our mains, but no one followed up or offered the wine menu. When we were seated, one wait staff said ""We can offer you our flatbread, please choose two toppings"". We were later charged for the flatbread, and duly paid. However, this left a poor impression as we did not feel that the wait staff was unaware of the implications of the words she chose.We spent approx $350 for the dinner. For this price, there are numerous other places one have visited for a memorable dinner with better food quality and service. We will not return, and recommend that if you choose to patronise this establishment, try it for a casual night instead of a special occasion."

As a result, he has become somewhat spoiled in the gastronomical department, with very jaded taste buds. So when he rang me up one day and gushed about a new restaurant, I sat up and took notice. In fact, he even went so far as to proclaim it the to-go place to take someone he'd want to impress.When faced with such a bold statement., I quickly grabbed the nearest friend and went down to Osia as soon as our schedules allowed.Food : The truffled  kalamanta olive flatbreads were pretty yummy and came with a tube of squeezable dip which was really fun! I loved loved loved the seafood ice experience. Maybe I'm partial to seafood, and maybe also because I'm partial to sorbet, but this was such a great combination. I always believed that if one served the best produce, one needs to do very little to actually enhance its flavour. And nowhere was this clearer than in this particular dish, where the natural sea freshness of the food was sharpened and crystallised by the different accompanying flavours of sorbet. The foie gras was pretty well done, as was the compression of truffled water melon with goat cheese. The beef was decent but the barramundi was so-so. Didn't think much of the chocolate Valrhona soup but then I'm not much of a chocolate fan.Ambience : Lovely, we were there on a Wednesday and it struck a nice balance between bustling and a ghost town.Service : Excellent.Overall a great experience.

It kind of reminded me of Indian curry. There were tons of chicken in the bowl but with bone on so you really do have to chew or cut at the meat. They had a pineapple slice which was nice.The butter pineapple bread was ridiculous. It was cut in half with a slab of butter in the middle. I wasn't a huge fan of this one and hope to find something else in the city later.The chicken wings were plentiful but really tiny. They were about half the size of a normal wing.

I like spicy food so I enjoyed this dish.  However, if I had to pick just one noodle dish, it would be the Signature Crispy Pork Lard Truffle Noodles (S$12 or about US$9.80). Toss the springy noodles with the crispy cubes of deep-fried pork lard for a flavourful mix of textures. The earthy truffle oil made this dish more addictive unless you aren't a fan of mushrooms or truffles. If you can tolerate spices, try the Chili Pomelo Crabmeat & Minced Pork Xiao Long Bao 小笼包 (SGD9 / USD6.65 for 4 dumplings). The filling packs a spicy punch within a thin, pliable dumpling skin. If you need help to overcome the burn from the chili, order a bottle of Blue Lotus all-natural Soya Bean Milk to ""put out the fire in your mouth""."

Anyway, while it may be American it seems to have borrowed the idea of cook your own meal from the Koreans (though as my mum said, why go to a restaurant to cook a meal when you can do it at home - she never understood the concept). As for this place, it's pancakes that you cook, which means that you can make them as big (or as small) as you like. Hey, if you really want to you could probably make them as big as the grill.

I guess I was expecting century egg and pork flavour. They recommended us the herbal chicken thigh set which was less than 8 dollars. A whole very tender fall apart thigh and the sauce had the herbal taste. Made for good drizzling. You char kway (or is that yoo char kway) had a crisp bite to the edges without being the crunch biscuit type. Seemed to soak up the congee well and serving size was big in the set. It's 40 cents per condiment and it's small portions. Think of 1 tablespoon portion. But it's only 40 cents. We tried the salted egg. It was soft and succulent (ie not overcooked) but only 2 quarters, ikan bilis (crunchy and light). Then we ordered a tau kwa with braised peanuts for 2 dollars. That was quite a good deal. The tau kway was silky and smooth and piping hot. There's only a few tables here but it does taste home cooked. As we left my mom was saying she would come again."

The kind waiter gave me the menus and I asked his recommendations on what to do. I ended up getting what I thought was a 3 course menu (although I don't see it on the site) and consisted of:1) Trio Medley on Ice - Abalone, crab and some veggies on an ice bowl. Tastes like you're eating cold leftover food. Not really my thing.2) Milky Chicken Broth served in a coconut shell - Interesting and creative although again not my kind of flavor.3) Lemongrass Jello - Nice flavor.I don't think I did the true Forest experience but the two dishes I ordered were highly recommended and they just weren't to my palette. I will come back again to see if their tasting menu is any good."

The restaurant itself is casual. Families and kids would be comfortable. There was some dissonance in the place. Service was attentive but the ambience did not match the refinement of the food, which was good. Presentation was top notch. Quality was excellent, ingredients were matched with great imagination in terms of combinations. However taste, which is the final arbiter was good but not great. Don't get me wrong. It was very good but expectations were sky high considering the chefs reputations. Unfortunately the food, in my opinion did not manage to reach the bar. It was pricy and frankly you could get better tasting food elsewhere. Nonetheless I would recommend a try. The food is an attempt to expand from typical ""Chinese"" to a kind but not quite fusion food. The chefs should be lauded in trying to break out from the usual. To that extent it was successful."

They had mosquito coil under the table which I thought was a nice gesture, I was still bitten once but that's not too bad..I love the fact that the menu is not too big and the waiters seem knowledgable about the food. Quick individual reviews: Cod (extremely delicious and was our favorite, perfectly cooked; the mushroom and spinach and broth complement the fish well), cauliflower (tender inside with a slight crunch on the outside), lamb ribs (must try, very interesting spices), bone marrow (i've never had bone marrow with snails but good combination), strawberry basil sangria (a little too sweet, would have been perfect for brunch).Minus: Slow service.

Ever since my first visit back in 2012, I've revisited a couple of times may it be for a quick bite or just a couple of after-work drinks with my colleagues. Two Sundays ago, me and 2 other friends decided to visit the restaurant for a casual brunch and to try out some new items in their brunch ""tartines"" menu. We reached at around 12-ish and were greeted by the manager in charge, Max. The restaurant recently underwent some minor ""face lifts"" with nicely upholstered chair and the addition of 2 very modern / zen centerpiece. But what makes this place so inviting anytime of the day is the beautiful natural light that shines through the glass panels from one side of the restaurant. The other side of the restaurant faces the ""jungle"" gives it a cooling and relaxing effect while you dine in.For drinks, M and S ordered mocktails each while I opted for a cocktail (of course.. by any given chance to get drunk on a Sunday) . Their mocktails were refreshingly while my sea salt and chili margarita totally woke me up from my half-sleepy state. Not too strong but still with a kick. Love the Ron Julio Reposado tequila they use as the base. We had seared scallop Carpaccio and beet-cured king salmon for starters. The bright color of the king salmon (from the beet) got us asking for more while we polished that plate of scallop carpaccio within minutes. Both starters were light, flavourful and perfect start to the afternoon.  For mains, we had a plate of crackling suckling pig and grilled french quail to share.  While we all agree that the mains should be bigger in portion, the flavors were spot on and the accompaniment definitely elevated the dish. The suckling pig was amazingly good with mashed sauerkraut and mustard while the grilled quail comes with bits of bacon sprinkled all over it. From the newly brunch tartines menu, we tried 2 items - one savoury and one sweet. For savoury, we had braised whole egg plant with onion, garlic and tomatoes with pine nuts. I might be slightly biased and you can just grill an eggplant with salt and I would say it's good. This one was phenomenal. For sweet, we had a bostock brioche with almond cream paired with prune and almagnac ice cream. Typing the description itself makes me really hungry now. FML.  And if you're here, this is something I would highly recommend you order.For desserts, we felt that the poached pear was slightly undercook (hard) and could be executed better. I am not a big fan of poached pear so I just had a small piece and washed down with the lemongrass tea I ordered. My dining partner had a latte and was impressed to know they brew Vittoria coffee from Australia.  Service was attentive and our glasses were filled with water most if not throughout the meal."

I got the set lunch, consisting of a salad/soup, main and dessert, for $38++. It was decent though not fantastic, main gripe though, was that the service was achingly slow. - Roasted pumpkin salad with Roquefort cheese: more pumpkin than rocket, and it was slathered in a heavy glaze. It was a bit heavy tasting, though the pumpkin went well with the cheese. - Grilled Norwegian salmon, chorizo and shaved fennel: presentation was good and the diced chorizo in beans was tasty. While the salmon skin was nice and crispy, the fish was slightly overcooked, tough and bland. - Sweet corn panna cotta, popcorn and truffle oil: slightly too firm but went nicely with the popcorn. The truffle undertone definitely added an interesting twist to the dish. I also heard good things about the hangar steak and prawn linguine that my friends opted for. Seems like the dinner items seem better than the lunch. Would love to return to try!"

But there was simply too much olive oil in the sauce.  The flavor of the olive oil overpowered many of the other flavors.  The small tomatoes were some of the best I've eaten in Singapore.tinyurl.com/8sphepwKing Prawns al la Plancha - The prawns were good but certainly not the best I've had recently.  The mushroom and chorizo ragout was very nice.  I enjoyed this more than the prawns themselves.  I would note that the two elements of this dish (prawns and ragout) did not really marry as a dish.  It was more like two distinct dishes.tinyurl.com/8uf7m6tSteamed Mussels - We loved these.  Lol, my companion wrestled the dish back from a server to insure she could have the very last mussel.  They were quite small.  But they were very tender and the citrus flavors of the broth were very refreshing.tinyurl.com/98qmkp7Roaster Miso Cod - This was a nice dish.  There wasn't anything particularly fancy about it.  But the fish was well prepared and the flavors were very delicate.tinyurl.com/8swr5hwApple Rhubarb Crumble - For dessert, I selected the crumble.  This was very much a western style comfort dessert.  The crumble part was a little harder than a normal crumble.  This made it difficult to incorporate both crumble and fruit into single bites.  But the rhubarb and apples worked perfectly together.  I enjoyed this every much.tinyurl.com/8ldncv9Passion Fruit Brûlée Cocktail - My friend selected a cocktail for dessert.  It looked quite tasty and she certainly seemed to enjoy it.  tinyurl.com/8knxyo9Overall, this was a very enjoyable dining experience.  While not extraordinary, the restaurant does combine a very nice ambiance, solid service, and, for the most part, well executed and presented food.  I would return."

I went with high hopes, bolstered by a slew of wonderful praises about the ingenuity of the food here, and the suspense was ever-more built by the fact that I had tried to brunch here more than a couple times (and something always happened to stop it*).*maybe it was the gourmand gods/ fate.it's a rather awesome menu - large, interesting-sounding, and immensely enticing what with the descriptions. I massively love menus that tell me exactly what I'm going to eat - there's something to be said for being held in suspense, but usually I like to order what I know I'd really want to eat.I've come to a point where small portions are appreciated only when expected - usually as part of a many-coursed meal - and I most certainly don't expect it at brunch, which in itself is a hedonistic activity to ingest in a single meal what you would eat in two.the amount of food we got irked me to no end, especially since the quality of cooking and execution here was pretty great. it's a pretty refined brunch, dishes are colorful, and the flavors are more than decent.an eggs cocotte was redolent with truffle and savoury mushrooms, and my halloumi dish was perked up with segments of peeled orange and a couple gren leaves.the partner was the only one that ordered a brunch big of braised pork cheeks, all soft and tender and delicious over a bed of soft silky truffled mash.but at twenty for my halloumi, I expect a little more than what would constitute only a small square of cheese and not even half an orange; and at thirty for the pork cheeks, perhaps some greens would have been welcome - not to mention quite a bit more mash or meat for a satisfying meal.the desserts were even more spectacular in execution, but didn't buck the (lack of) size trend.this magnum-like bar of roquefort & honey ice cream coated in dark chocolate was a play on contrast between the rather blue ice cream and the not-too-sweet quality chocolate shell that shattered upon impact. I can't much tolerate blue cheeses, and this was almost too strong for me to take, but the chocolate helped temper the pungency - and I found myself returning for more.the sticky toffee pudding was also darn delicious (and more sizable!): warm, moist pud sloping with its weight of delicious vanilla-speckled ice cream all drizzled with a delicious caramel.and also the peanut-butter-and-chocolate fondant, which came super dark (almost black, really) with roast banana slices on the side with another scoop of that fantastic icecream. it was warm and oozey and satisfyingly chocolatey.at the end of it, it was a fantastic meal flavor-wise. the chefs know what they're doing in the kitchen, and flavors are contrasting and complementary, and the plating is both beautiful and very modern - but with three courses needed for any measure of satiety, and lunch-set portions what's more, it's a format of dining I think best left for more measured, formal meals than brunch.the meal left me disgruntled for sure - I understand restaurants need to be profitable, but there's a fine line between sustainability and miserliness, and I think they might have stepped over it."

On weekends, the menu is limited to brunch tartines (open sandwich) and a couple of specials only. We opted for the lobster tartine - definitely as fancy as it sounds. One big slab of bread covered in delicious lobster and toasted gruyere. We also opted for the special, which was truffled chicken. Also delicious and delicately portioned. The food is expensive, but the ingredients are high quality too. I did scoff at the $20+ 'Melbourne tartine' of smashed avocado on toast, but then again they charge about $18 for fancy versions of that at home too. The service was very attentive (almost too much given how few people were there) and it was a relaxing and quiet break after a full week of living on hawker centre food."

Dinner, or weekday lunches where they have great value sets.Okay. Ribs. Crispy lamb shortribs. OMG THESE ARE LIKE CRACK. They're crispy, fall off the bone tender and flavourful, served with a yoghurt sauce and couscous. It's just the bomb. I could work through a plate of these allll byyyyy myyyyyself. (Yes you're supposed to imagine me sing that)The fish skin. Deep fried. Crisp. Light. Super appetizing. If you've never tried fried fish skin, you need to try it. Think pork cracking, but well. With a SLIGHT fish taste. I believe the dish was called salt of the sea or something like that.Beyond that? Many of the other dishes are pretty good, though those two are by far the absolute bests on the menu imho. I've been with 3-4 different groups of people, so trust me when I say it's generally a hit amongst most people I introduce to it.The biggest compliment I would pay it though, is that I personally think a meal at TDC is far more worth it than Bacchanalia. Similar concept, in the sharing dishes and modernity. Totally different pricing, totally different feels... but for me TDC is so much better value, and so much more likeable. #truestorybrah"

Service was friendly and attentive, they provided explanations of the food we ate plus the best way to eat together with which condiments. It's pretty basic and quite casual so no stress. The food was super fresh and eaten within seconds of it being cooked. Although everything was fried, the batter was light and everything was very tasty. Outstanding was the tofu with uni, the chawanmushi with foie gras was the best I have ever tasted and the rice with black truffle, which was at the end of the meal was incredible. Full as I was, I could have eaten another bowl. Was it worth the $200 per person? That really depends on each individual. My family agreed that it was."

I've dined here many times (mostly alone) for its hassle-free concept and centrally located in Tiong Bahru. Among my go-to sushi: Jack mackerel Surf clamyellowtailOtoro (fatty tuna)UniClam Miso soupLunch or dinner crowd can get very intense, so it's recommended to make a reservation before you come. There's an app for it. As for solo diner (like me), you can always walk-in and get a seat within 10-15mins. The reservation system can get really messy, especially when I've seen families with reservation tickets and still have to wait at least 30mins.  And for that, I am subtracting one star. Overall, Sushiro is not a bad place despite a rather poor reservation system. The sushis and sashimis are fresh and reasonably priced. It's like traffic jams in big cities. You can't avoid them, but you can plan your day ahead so you don't get too stressed out. Same here. All you need is a little planning - may be eat a little earlier or later before the peak hours.

The non-fan wife has now started craving Barrio's Fish Tacos! Loaded Nachos ($13.60)Off the bat, they are very generous with the ingredients. For a snack, the Nachos came loaded on a plate, topped with a generous amount of chili con carne, jalapeños, guacamole, cotija cheese and melted cheddar. The guac was very good, fresh, clean and creamy but while it was tasty, I personally felt that there needed a bit more depth to the flavour. The chili wasn't as beefy or salty, while there weren't enough jalapeños or fresh tomatoes to add that level of acidity and the cheese didn't quite give that needed punch to lift the flavours. Again, the flavours are there but sort of all blended together with none of the ingredients really shining and bursting through. Carne Asada Rice Bowl ($14.80)This was yum on many levels. The rice was well cooked and fluffy, while the black beans added a nice crunch and depth to the flavour. The beef was tender and very tasty while the sour cream and salsa picante added a nice sour / spicy kick to not only help elevate the flavours but cut the meatiness of the dish as well. Fish Taco ($13.40 for 2 / $15.90 for 3)This was truly the star of the show. The beer battered seabass was very lightly coated and fried to perfect crispness while the fish inside was soft, moist and cooked perfectly. It was wonderfully seasoned and went perfectly well with the crisp clean vegetables. Pickled red cabbage helped bring out the sweetness of the fish and made the flavours even more appetizing while the chipotle aioli helped add a level of saltiness and pungent-ness that tied and lifted the flavours to another level. Topped with a squeeze of lime and the taco came to life, bursting with flavours and having a mint salsa party in my mouth.  Mexican fries ($4.50 or upgradable in a set)Fries were a little gimmicky, essentially being just fries with some peppery powered over. The dip the fries came with however was excellent and the portion was pretty generous. Overall, dining at Barrio reminded me of why I loved Mexican food so much. It's bright, clean flavours makes for not only an appetizing experience, but one that will leave you craving for more!"

Rochester Mall, I suspect, is pretty much empty during weekends save for Sunday's church goers (a famous mega church, new creation is located nearby). Rochester is situated near offices and education institutes, both of which are deserted on weekends which explains the emptiness of the place despite having a renowned chef. Executive Chef Kenny Yeo has a vast experience helming renowned restaurants in Singapore and Taipei including a 3-star Michelin hotel in France.

The service is attentive, and the menu is typical european style. The website mentioned that it is an epicurean restaurant, so I was expecting great things. Maybe if my expectations weren't that high, it wouldn't have been so disappointing. The dishes are average or slightly above average, but there is no outstanding dishes. I had the risotto with foie gras. The foie gras was nicely cooked, but the risotto was lacking in finesse. If the prices are lower, I would go back a second time."

It created a rather appealing environment for dining. Business was brisk when we went in but we were still seated right away. The service was up to Singapore standards meaning it significantly exceeded US standards. We had the duck which was very nicely prepared. We had rice, vegetables and garlic tofu as accompaniments with tea to drink as part of the lunch set. I was rather happy with the experience in general. The price was very fair at just over $30 SGD for the two of us. My colleague picked up the tab so I did not see the final tally. But it struck me as a very good deal for the quality of the fare. If you are in the area, it is worth a stop. They apparently also have a handful of other locations around Singapore as well."

Back then, I thought of it as an udon place -- they used to sell mentaiko udon, which was delicious. Sadly, it's no longer available. However, I discovered their Japanese charcoal grill, which is fantastic! And they also do excellent fried foods, like chicken and pork katsu, and croquettes. My meal today was a chicken katsu donburi, which is a giant chicken cutlet with egg and onions on top. The entire giant plate was only $8.50! My companion had a heaping of grilled beef and chicken with Japanese curry for $10.90, and it's some of the best grilled beef around. I have tried their ramen my previous visit, and I think it's a way better idea to get the meat dishes. You won't regret it. Just make sure you are prepared for the size of the meal because I have seen people throw away so much food from this place just because they give too much. *tear* Such a waste!"

Someone had asked if they could omit bacon from the avocado wrap but we were told they couldn't because they are pre-rolled. I mean that's pretty lazy shit if you can't make an avocado wrap to order. Ironically I ordered the avocado roll and was among the last to be served even though it was already pre-made and all they did was microwave it. You can taste the lack of effort in the wrap which was a trend repeated among all the other dishes from salmon in broth to the angus cheeseburger - sloppy, lacking flavor, and miserly portions.

Especially since it's park land, and rental suppose to be lower. And then there's the service, which many point out as a positive. I do agree, the staff are friendly, but they could be a lot more efficient and attentive to details. For example, we were a table of 6, but they only provided 5 sets of cutlery in the little pail, coffee came without the sugar etc. And so there was always the additional need to summon their attention when it could have been avoided.

We were there on a Saturday evening and I believe that you should not have any problems getting a seat even without reservations as Bishan Park is not the busiest place to hang out in during the weekends. The menu is extensive, with pizzas, pastas and mains like Beef Bourguignon and Yorkshire Pork Rack.For my group of 4 at dinner, we ordered 1 Sakura Chicken (friend's comment - delicious!), mushroom soup (did not ask for comment) and 3 Yorkshire Pork Racks.A minor disappointment happened right here with the pork racks. Only 1 was served and the other 2 were not looking like they were appearing, so we checked with the staff. The staff came back to us to say that the pork racks were 'on the way'. From there, we waited long enough for them to have cooked the pork racks from scratch so they definitely forgot the 2 other pork racks. Would have been great if the dishes were served together, but mistakes do happen. Would have loved if we were told that the dishes were missed out but understand that some customers may throw a fit right then and there if this was mentioned.When my pork rack finally came out, it was tender, and delicious. The lovely layer of fat was very scrumptious and the mashed potatoes were creamy and had me lapping up every last bit of it. The pork rack was easy to handle, and did I say it was delicious? However, I do have to bring up something less than ideal about the pork rack. I believe that they might have been rushing to serve the pork rack due to having forgotten it prior, so the meat was actually rather pink in the middle. I chose not to sent the food back to the kitchen and I do think this was an exception to the norm, so this should not discourage you from ordering the pork rack.All in, this was worth a visit and you should drop by. Just tell them to pay attention to the pork if you are squeamish about blood."

But the ambience is actually quite good for a quiet chat. So, just focus on the surroundings and your company, more than the drinks available.Another thing about canopy is that dogs are allowed in here, which is very cool. So there are quite a few pet owners with their dogs here especially during weekends. Hence, if you are allergic to furry cute dogs, it may be a good idea to steer clear during the weekends.I think the food, drinks and service really warrants about 3 stars but I just really like the idea of dining within a lovely park so this gets 3.5 stars!

I was shocked to see a queue of at least 20 people at the entrance. Everyone apparently had a reservation as well. We had a party of 10 with a reservation as well, but we were told that one person had to stand in line and make the payment for all 10, and the remaining 9 could go in and get a seat. So take note, to have all your cash ready to make payment before your enter.Sakura had just undergone a renovation and here's their new interior. Gone are the old bambo/fake japanese looking deco. It looks alot bigger and roomier than it used to.Here is their fresh fruits, jelly and cold desserts section. I tried their mango sago and I found it too sweet and thick. The blueberry yogurt jelly tasted like a yakult pudding and it was quite nice. There was a cooked food counter which was churning out Hokkien Prawn Mee, Oyster Omelette and Fried Carrot Cake. So here is their prawn mee with a pretty huge prawn. There was some wok hei to it, and tasted decent. The Oyster Omelette was okay too, the portions are just right for your to test taste. The PRC uncle will ring a bell to tell you that the food is ready for collection. Here is their drink offerings, by the end of our buffet at 1:30pm there was no more ice and no one came to refill it. The lunch buffet ends at 3pm. But when the coffee machine drawer was full and I notified a waiter, he quickly rectified the issue so we could enjoy cups of cappuccino. The coffee machine makes coffee which is mainly 1/2 cup of milk and drips of some coffee. It can be quite bitter but I enjoyed the bitterness and I nibbled on my plate of rainbow cake.I tried every cake because I have a sweet tooth and I thoroughly enjoyed their rainbow cake, durian puff which is the plain looking cream puff. The cream puff which has a white topping is actually a plain cream puff. The banana tart/cake was decently sweet, though tasting slightly artificial, since I wasn't able to eat any actual bites of banana in it.Though miniscule compared to the ones you get at cafes. It was just nice for me. The sponge was light and the butter cream was sweet enough for my liking. The rainbow cake was refilled only once during the buffet at 1:30pm as we were leaving. It was popular amongst families with young children.Sakura offers soup buns with a hole cut inside, for your to pour a small portion of soup in. The bun itself was slightly crisp, and it tasted okay with the cream of mushroom soup. The chicken karage was very crispy and tender. You could taste the thigh meat. The calamari tasted okay, but it was not crispy. The tempura vegetables were quite hard. The sushi were better than what I remembered Sakura used to have. At least they improved on that.Each table has an induction cooker with a pot of soup so here is their shabu shabu section. Lots of vegetables for anyone who aspires to be rabbit, and also fresh raw fish. Otah, Satay and even hainanese chicken, not a bad selection of local cuisines. The satay itself was okay, but every stick were drowned in satay sauce. I didn't mind the sweetness of it. The har jiong kai (fried prawn paste chicken) was crispy and very tasty. I enjoyed it. Tasted like the ones you get at the Tze Char restaurants at coffee shops.I tried their mac n cheese which on the bottom left tray and the cheese tasted very strange. Probably heavily processed cheese. The meatballs were definitely frozen, didn't taste good.Here is their sushi offerings. Quite popular with the crowd as I watched them disappear with a blink of an eye.The service staff were quick to clear our plates and they were attentive and helped refill our soups a couple of times. My worst experience from Sakuta came from the entrance at the cash register. The guy who is collecting cash/the bottleneck is also the same guy who is picking up phone calls and reservations. You could be in line waiting to give this guy hundreds of dollars, and he's starring at you but taking down a phone reservation. This needs to change, because this is what caused the long line of people outside Sakura.. TAKE OUR MONEY AND LET US EAT! All in all a decent buffet for $16.90++ for lunch. A lot of office people from the nearby industrial estate and since it is the school hollidays, alot of families with young children were seen at the buffet. Do come early, else they will sit you outside, no air con but they have oscilating fans. I did enjoy the rainbow cake :) I would re-consider this buffet again during lunch should I have a massive rainbow cake cravings. Definitely not the best rainbow cake I have had, but it is a nice treat to end the buffet lunch."

Annnd according to their menu, they don't use MSG (Although I get that thirsty, MSG mouth after, but ever so slightly. Not complaining. The food is good!) I usually judge a Korean restaurant by their banchan (side dishes) and Hansik's doesn't disappoint. Fresh, delicious, free and -- best part -- unlimited (some Korean restaurants here cut you off at 2 rounds ! Usually, we're given 6-7 banchan such as: kimchi, beansprouts, mushrooms and blanched spinach. It changes all the time, but kimchi is one of the staples. The menu is quite extensive. I haven't had em all but most of what I tried, I liked. Here are some of my recommendations: Soups: soft tofu seafood stew ($16), ginseng chicken soup ($23), beef short rib soup ($18).  The soft tofu seafood stew looks spicy but it's not. You can ask them to adjust the spice level. I thought the Soybean Paste Stew ($16) was chock full of clams but a little on the salty side.   Bibimbap: Go with the Hot Stone Bibimbap ($16) for more drama and crunch. It differs from the regular Bibimbap (which comes in a regular bowl) by $2.Hot Pot: If you have 2 or more people, consider getting a hot pot to share. My favourite is the Seafood Hotpot ($43)BBQ: Best part is that they do the cooking for you!! Both chicken dishes (Spicy BBQ and Charbroiled, each at $21) are excellent. I guess it all boils down to personal taste and mood. The Spicy Chicken isn't spicy and is marinaded in gochujang (red fermented bean paste that is the base of so many Korean dishes). The Charbroiled is marinated in a soy based sauce. Beef: Was a little disappointed in the A+ Prime Ribeye ($42). I guess because it's such a fancy cut, the portion is pretty small. I ordered it with the Charbroiled Chicken and it was not as flavorful or plentiful compared to the chicken. Do note that for BBQ, you have to order a minimum of 2 dishes (chicken/beef, chicken/chicken or chicken/pork). One cool thing is that you get to ""top-up"" your 2 dishes with a soup, more mushrooms or steamed egg for $10. Usually a soup costs $16.    I really love their cold barley tea, and they have Hite beer and soju too. My only gripe is that service can be spotty/brusque and if you come between 7-8pm, you'll have to wait.  What I usually do is go around 6pm. Best value for money is the lunch sets. The ginseng chicken soup usually costs $20+ but for lunch it's $12+"

I must say I did not believe her much when she said it was good or that it was always crowded. Reason being it always looked empty when I passed by the place on week nights around 6pm. I guess the crowd only appears closer to 7pm and on weekends. After many months since the recommendation, I finally made it there at 630pm on a week night. The place was partially filled. I thought it was quite kind of the staff to give us a table for 4 when there were only 2 of us. I realized why when the food arrived. The beef bulgogi pot took up a lot of space! Add the banchan (7 of them), and they filled the entire table. We ordered the beef bulgogi with mushrooms for 2 persons and the quantity was more than enough to feed 3 or 4. We were stunned when we saw the amount of meat and mushrooms and tang hoon on the pot. The staff will come around to cook the food and cut the noodles and beef into more manageable sizes. The beef was tender and the mushrooms were big and juicy. Love it. The ban chan was good and we were just so filled up that we did not finish any of that. The kimchi stew was also stellar. Spicy, sour and full of cabbage and tofu. I love that instead of water, they put a jug of houjicha (cold) on the table for our consumption. The bill came to about $60+ which I thought was quite reasonable. The service was prompt and efficient. I am so glad to find a place for decent Korean food place in my area, and I no longer have to make do with those from the food courts."

I recommend the ginseng soup, the barbecue set and the bibimbap.Price: 3.5/5 The other downside of the place. The ginseng soup, which was very delicious, costed $21 and if you want extra soup, you have to pay an extra $4. The price came to about $182 for 4 people which was quite expensive.

One thing i love about Korean cuisine is the kim chi and it has to taste just right else it would spoil the whole meal. The kimchi here was excellent just like the ones i had in Korea.The other dishes like beef, their pancakes and stews were all so delicious. Although they came in small portions but it was just nice as they had quite a number of dishes served.

I might be old-fashioned at heart, but when I go to an Italian restaurant, I would prefer if the staff was Italian. If it's Japanese sushi, I would prefer the sushi chef to be Japanese instead of some chinese guy spouting Cantonese. As such, it was a pleasant surprise that the staff at this quaint korean restaurant were all korean. True, their english is not fantastic, but I come here for good food, not for anything else so it's all good. The menu was impressive by its diversity. I was spoiled for choice because there were so many items on the menu that I couldn't decide. I ended up choosing the ginseng chicken soup since I was sick and it did not disappoint. This is the best ginseng chicken I've had in Singapore so far. The soup was tasty and the chicken was so tender. And I love the congee in it. Definitely a good choice if you're into ginseng chicken. The small dishes were good, although nothing blew me away. The seafood kimchi pancake was on the small side but the flavor was good. I loved the bibimbop here. The vegetables were fresh, the sunny side up was perfectly cooked, and the ratio of meat and vege to rice was 2:1 which is great for the carb-conscious. The tofu stew was pretty good too, has a kick in the spice department. The cold noodles were very authentic as well. We got the mushroom beef pot to share as well. I thought the beef was better bbqed than broiled in the hot pot but my sister really liked it so it's a matter of taste. Reasonable prices, no conventional crazy strong smoke smell in the restaurant (which is a big plus), good authentic food. Need I say more?"

As similar to the previous restaurant, the restaurant also offers lunch set at reasonable prices ranging from $12.80++ to $18.80++.One of the lunch set is Bara Chirashi Set ($14.80++), which comes with salad, appetizer, steamed egg, miso soup and fruits. It is quite a good deal considering that an ala carte order of Bara Chirashi Don costs $18.80++ for normal and $28.80++ for Premium.The steamed egg is served pipping hot and taste smooth down the throat. The miso soup is light and flavourful. The salad is served with soyu dressing, tastes light and refreshing. The appetiser is spicy chicken cubes which is refreshing cold. The bara chirashi is consists of cubes of tuna, salmon, crab stick, swordfish, egg and furikake on top of sushi rice. The mixture is quite tasty and the seafood tastes fresh too. The dish is also beautifully decorated with a flower on top.Overall the food is not bad. Staffs are quite friendly too.

The lobster comes with the full shell and claws, so it might look intimidating at first, but actually most of the meat has already been cooked in with the pasta.

That being said, I enjoyed everything form the crispy pork cheeks to the duck confit to the beef tenderloin. None of the desserts were very extraordinary though. Skip the extra charge for the souffle dessert as it wasn't really that great. The highlights are really the foie gras and the meats, but that's what most crave for anyway.

Now, he's back with a bigger menu with a lot of options to try! Ranging from burgers, chicken and fish plates to  shrimp, steaks, ribeyes and po-boys.They even have a wide selection of sides, most mains come with two sides. Pick from mexican rice, double baked cheese potato, mushroom soup, spicy louisana chicken gumbo, heinz baked beans, coleslae, regular fries, cajun fries, fresh salad or pasta salad.1. Cheesesteak Po-Boy $9.90First up was the cheesesteak po-boy, having lived in Pennsylvania, home of the Philly cheesesteak, I was excited to try this! This is only the lite version, which was still at least 6 inches long. Paired with the baked cheese potato which I highly recommend and coleslaw. The meat sadly, was very tough and hard to chew on. It's the hardest cheesesteak sandwich I had ever come across, I was sad to end up wiping the plate clean of the sides and leaving the sandwich behind. 2. Fish and Chips $6.90The fish and chips faired alot better than the cheesesteak po-boy. The fish fillet was huge for the price and tasted pretty good. The mushroom soup here was served in a cup, there were real mushrooms in there and you could tell it didn't come out of a can. The soup tasted good and the salad was fresh.3. Cajun Chicken Plate $6.90The cajun chicken was very tasty. I love cajun flavoured food and this was one of them. It wasn't too spicy, just slightly tangy.Their serving of fries was ginormous! I didn't expect this much for a lite serving of Cajun Chicken.All in all, hits and misses, but with their low prices and hidden location in an industrial estate, only time will tell if their business will succeed. I visited on a weekend and noticed several families with young children were patronizing Big Bern's. Another plus point is this coffee shop on the second floor is air-conditioned."

It may very well turn into my go-to place for a casual place to hang out and leave with a fat, happy stomach.I was born and raised in the US and just recently moved here. Singapore food is great and there's tons of variety. But I get these cravings for solid American food - a good burger with fries, sandwiches, steak, etc. Mostly, my wife and I kind of settle for fast food (McDonald's, Carl Jr, etc) because ""Western food"" can be either really pricey or not quite the same level/standard as we're used to in the US.I'm thinking about moving into the Toa Payoh area and noticed that there was an American grill place nearby. (It's a pretty decent walk from the MRT - you should get there in a bit under 10 minutes.) There are pretty large, clear signs so you'll find it, for sure. I was pleasantly surprised to find Big Bern's located indoors (which is nice because it's air-conditioned) next to some standard Singaporean ""hawker fare"". Kind of interesting to find an American grille smack dab in the middle of local SIngaporean stalls - but all the more awesome because you can grab Indian, Chinese, Malay, Indo food, drinks, desserts to combine with your American fare.We were greeted by Big Bern himself - generally pleasant guy and the staff were cool. Note: The place is self-service but straightforward and casual!Big Bern's has good deals - I got a cheeseburger with two sides (spiced cajun fries and pasta salad) for $11.90, which is about what I'd pay for about the same amount of food at other fast food eateries. BUT.. the quality is way better! The meat itself was high quality and you can see how everything was fresh and handmade. The burger itself wasn't very wide in diameter, but was really thick (nearly 2 inches thick!). Portion size is substantial - I was intending on splitting it but ended up eating everything myself and left pretty full.I noticed that they have a pretty extensive menu and I can't wait to go back and try their cheesesteak sandwich and steaks! Not sure where they get their meat, but it's one of the better quality meats I've tasted while here in Singapore for a very affordable price.I'm super happy to have found a laid-back American grill place within walking distance from where I'm looking to live. TOTALLY LEGIT!"

Firstly, make reservations. If not, you'll wait for a long time. Even with reservations, you have to wait! Secondly, know that this place is pricy. If you're having crabs, be prepared to drop a good dime here. Estimate about $90 for a medium crab--good for 2 or 3, I think.We got the butter crab and crab bee hoon. Crab bee hoon is the classic dish here and everyone gets it. It is very good. Add more soup and bee hoon; it is worth it. The butter crab is good too, and has a more heavy flavor and is also very creamy. Both were delicious. The crabs are fresh and the meat is plentiful and succulent. After all, you're paying good money for these crabs.The other side orders are good too. We got rojak chicken, tofu with pork floss and mushrooms, and salted egg pork ribs. The salted egg pork ribs were not very meaty, unfortunately. Come here for crabs. The crabs are so good.

This outlet which I went is located at Ang Mo Kio, it is just located right below a HDB. I went to this place on 2 separate occasion and it's always bustling with people. There's a huge carpark located infront of the restaurant and fret not there's plenty of car lot. But try to avoid popping by during dinner time as this is a residential area so car lot might be limited.We order quite a number of dish that night and it was a treat by a friend therefore I can't state the bill for the meal. 1) Signature Crab Beehoon Soup 5/5This is a must to try, the broth make you go drooling and it's so flavourful as the beehoon and crab is cook together. I always ask for extra portion of soup as it's really very good.2) Salted Egg yolk Crab 4/5Anything cook with salted egg yolk is always so yummy. The crab is coated with salted egg yolk and the flavour just blend in so well which keep your finger locking good3) Butter Crab 4/5Oh my, the mantou really goes well with the butter sauce and the children keep dipping into the sauce with their mantou and crab. I think this really tells you how good it is. 4) Cereal Prawn 4/5This is one of my all time favourite, love the fragrant smell of the cereal and Prawn. They just simply blend in and the Prawn is so crunchy.If you ever pop by here, pls order their signature crab beehoon soup. Trust me it's really very very good."

We had the crab with bee hoon soup, butter crab & chilli crab with fried mantous (dough). For drinks we had the fresh coconut ($5) each. Our guests love this place & declare it as the most delicious crab they have ever eaten in Sg.

So my suggestion will be make an effort to call and make a reservation 1 day before.They are famous for their crab, the most famous dish will be the crab beehoon (rice noodles) soup. So you will see almost each table will have this dish. The soup are very nice have a strong taste of crab freshness, if you want more soup you may request for a bowl or two, but they charge for each bowl or soup.I also recommend that you try the butter and salted egg crab. You might want to skip the chili crab, personally I find it don't taste as good as lots of other restaurant in Singapore.The only problem I have with this restaurant is no Aircon, so get ready to sweat when enjoy those yummylious crab."

The wait here is VERY long, even on rainy weekdays so definitely do come early.

Pick up a menu, and prepare to order while waiting in line so the wait for your food will not take as long once you are seated.We ordered 2 small chili crabs, 2 small butter crabs, 1 medium Signature Crab Soup Bee Hoon (Noodle Soup), Jia Mantao (Fried Buns - which are great for dipping in the chili or butter sauce), and stirred fried vegetables.

Our chrysanthemum tea had dead flies in it. It was like the box was infested with dead fruit flies and they just brewed the tea anyhow. My cousin and my aunties raised hell, and it was quite possibly the funniest moment I've ever seen.This being said, they first tried to deny it, and then they brought us fresh tea.

Firstly, the queue is always large, others here seem to think you can get through quickly at certain hours, but not anywhere near dinner. We arrived at 7:15pm, were seated at 8:30pm and the food arrived after 9pm.But when it does arrive, it is well worth the wait. The menu does not have prices listed, which is terrible, so prices may be slightly off. The first to arrive was the tofu combination ($7.80) which was a dozen or so fried tofu squares, some broccoli, two shelled prawns and two scallops. Quite average.Next up was the famous fried crab bee hoon ($55). We were lucky to get a female crab with lots of roe, and the whole dish is out of this world awesome. Not an incredibly secret list of ingredients, it should be easy to replicate this at home.Finally, the last dish was butter crab ($55) which I would never have ordered normally, except I read the comments on HGW and honestly believe in the wisdom of crowds. Very awesome dish, the sauce was thick, buttery, had a hint of chili and went perfect with the crab.So the positives were to be expected, the crabs are fantastic, and well worth the trek to AMK. Their are a few suggestions I have:* put prices on the menus. Yes, I know seafood is at market price, but even the veges on the menu are not priced. It is great that service charge + GST are included, but everyone should do this.* the tofu combination is below par* take credit cards and lose the whole no 100% guarantee crap - no-one advertises their terrible customer service"

The price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food; definitely better in every way compared with the boat quay tourist traps.

Opening its door since 1975 and serving quality food to her customer, Gim Tim has been seen popular with many. Gim Tim is located in rather humble air-conditioned restaurant below the HDB Blocks, for those who is not very familar with Ang Mo Kio area, the landmark to spot may be the Market & Food Centre in Ang Mo Kio Ave 4. Growing from this into establishing a group of resaturants with 3 outlets serving finest Hokkien, Sze Chuan and Cantonese cuisine.For weekends, its hardly that you will get a table without a reservation as it is usually fully booked with tables of happy family. Fortunately, we walked in early and got ourselves a table and was served by friendly staff. One good point to note was that you can see that Gim Tim employs senior citizens around as servers I felt very comfortable with.I must say that I was not very hungry but I had an impressive start with their deeply fried golden brown Xia Zao (Prawn Dumplings). Dipping into its sweet and savoury sauce was truly heavenly. The taste of it was indescribable and definitely unique on its own. I haven't tasted such different Xia Zao anywhere else! Deep Fried Xia Zao - $12 / $18 / $24Vegetables were not stated on their menu somehow and we had ordered the stirred fried Kai Lan with garlic. Nothing extra special about the dish, its quite standard.Kai Lan with Garlic - $10Replacing the bowls of rice, we had the fried traditional tapioca roll. If you enjoy the Hakka Abacus Beads / Seeds, I bet you would pretty much enjoy this dish! Ingredients were almost or identical to the Hakka dish with dried shrimp, spring onions, bean sprouts and tapioca. The catch in the dish is none other than the thin and springy slices of Tapioca Roll complemented by the sweet tasty sauce as well as the fragrant of fried dried shrimp. Yummy!Fried Traditional Tapioca Roll - $12 / $18The true blue classic Hokkien dish that I'm waiting for! Since everywhere is emphasizing on healthier food, I guess this is why Kong Bah has become lean nowadays! Slices of ""Bui Bui"" (Fatty translated from dialect) meat has gone lean!You can still see the distinctive layers on each and every piece of the Kong Bah though it was deeply coated in its toothsome braised sauce. Sandwich this good stuff in the fluffy smooth pau with a portion of lettuce and enjoy the absolute juicy-ness that comes to your mind as you sink your teeth into the meat! It was ever-so-satisfying!Steamed Preserved Meat Served with Bao (Kong Bah Bao) - $12 / $18 / $24Here comes the Teochew's Favourite, Or Nee aka Yam Paste! Marvelous, suiting the taste buds! With mashed Taro mixed with Gingko nuts and corn kernels, its naturally sweet with minimal use of sugar and coconut milk. I thought it was good as they had given good consideration to older folks who enjoy the desserts!Sweetened Taro Paste with Gingko Nut (Or Nee) - $4 / $15 / $30Nothing fanciful spotted from the Mango Puree with Pamelo, perhaps the way they served in a cup got our eyes wider? It was something running of the mill and not much comments about it.Mango Puree with Pamelo & Ice Cream - $4 / $15 / $30Gim Tim, I have always wanted to visit them many years back after hearing pleasant things about them via words of mouth and I was very pleased to visit them!  The spirit of their stuff and atmosphere of dining is something I'm looking forward to and you can see happy faces enjoying meals with their families of generations. It's a good place for family gathering and also if you enjoy such cuisine."

Unlike Changi, however, where the apron / tarmac separates you from the runway, you are only a stone's throw away from the runway at Soek Seng 1954 Bicycle Cafe (and those private jets' parking lots are literally right at the doorstep).The decor in this cafe is also interesting with more than 20 bicycles hanging around the cafe. These classic bicycles dating from the 50s belong to the owner and have all been restored to perfect working condition. Besides the bicycles, there are other bicycle related objects on display. Foodwise, the menu is a mixed-bag with some local fare and some western comfort food for lunch and dinner. There are a selection of cakes and coffee to complete your meal.

The main components include pieces of teriyaki beef slices and a bowl of curry sauce for you to dip so as to enhance the flavour of beef. Very often the bowl of curry comes with one or two pieces of carrot as well. Other components in this set meal include a bowl of seaweed soup as well as 2 blocks of agedashi tofu. The seaweed soup is not only tasty but, visually appealing. I could even see particles dangling in the bowl of soup. While in other places agedashi tofu of the same quantity is generally sold at S$2, I feel it is worth the price here as this S$2 has been included in the total price of S$6.30. Besides, the agedashi tofu here tastes much better than other places. I enjoy the wonderful sensation when the skin of agedashi tofu melting in my mouth very much. I am not sure how it's cooked, but I have seen stalls elsewhere simply pour boiled water over a bowl of lightly fried agedashi tofu and eventually add some octopus flakes. No wonder they taste so differently. Given the scenario of the current global recession, enjoying quality and affordable Japanese cuisine at this place is undeniably a wise choice."

While it does seem to be a decorated stall, do not let it's short queue question it's taste. That is because Penang Delights has a very fast service time, keeping the queue short and customers happy.Whenever I drop by Ang Mo Kio, this stall would be one of my prime considerations. I would order a large bowl of their prawn mee with added chili. The prawns were fresh and one could taste prawns in their prawn broth, showing the long hours put by the owner into watching the delicious pot of broth. While the texture of the noodles were average, it is compensated for by the presence of boiled pork strips to add to the chewiness in every mouthful. I find that it is customary to finish the broth despite it being more spicy than the average chili.Price wise, it is affordable, at $4.50 for a large bowl. One should definitely consider having Penang Prawn mee at this stall and realize how high a bar this stall has set for the standards of good prawn mee."

There is no centralized hawker centers but scattered coffee shops and food court all over made tracking good food difficult. However, this Hokkien is a pure delight to residents here. It is prepared by the distinct looking 70 year old uncle. Kudos to him because opening hours start from 11am to 11pm. He takes a break between 2-5pm. It's no easy feat, plus it's opened on most days of the week.This hokkien mee is sure not to be missed if you like the wetter version. This is really wet, stock is really flavorful and it really combines very well with the noodles. The wok hei (wok taste) is also very much apparent, yet not overpowering (which could make it tastes like chao tah (burned). Very light and comforting wok hei. That takes skills man!Chilli is the light orange kind of color. I'm not sure if they make their own chilli or get it from a supplier, but the chilli is well made, well blended to the noodles and has a kick. The lime, the chilli and the noodles are a very good combination. Queues can be long on the weekends and during lunch. Do try it after 7pm or for a supper. The let down is probably the food court's ventilation isn't very good and it can get pretty stuffy even in the night."

Bliss Restaurant may not serve the best food around, but it certainly has a nice chilling atmosphere for you to sit and enjoy a nice supper or late night drink with a good friend.I never knew the Community Centres can be so hip until I visited Bliss Restaurant at Cheng San CC. The food was so-so but the environment is pretty good. Besides the ""hu"" and the ""hah"" from the guys in the basketball court doing taekwando or other activities, it's actually pretty enjoyable. You can choose from the alfresco outdoor dinning (it can get rather dim so you may not really be able to see what you are eating) or the indoor dinning (for those who cannot live without aircon).They also have an interesting selection of alcohol from beer to wines and even cocktails. For some sweet bites, the selection of desserts is still decent but of course, not comparable to a town restaurant.The price is economical and overall experience. Wouldnt mind hanging out there again soon."

Beers and wines. Nice and cool to relax after a day of hard work. A social restaurant.I had the lamp shank and felt that it was overlooked as the meat was too soft. The sauce wasn't adding enough flavours to the dish. Only the mash potato which supposed to be the secondary item tasted great. This is a restaurant where it creates jobs for the special people. Therefore please support them whenever you are nearby. Might try other foods next time. Giving them another chance.

It is located in a community center near to Ang Mo Kio MRT. The restaurant offers quite a variety of alcohol drinks besides the usual western menu. Something special in a neighbourhood.What we like about the place is that it offers alcohol at a reasonable price and not crowded. The pace there is slow and you can enjoy the night sitting there. Another good thing is that it is easily accessible, out of safety concern. we can take public transport back after in take of alcohol.Never had the chance to try any main dish there. But from observation, serving are quite big but serving time is quite slow. We ordered fries to go along with the beer. Beer took some time to be serve and fries took even longer. It was serve after we are half through our beer. But what's the hurry when you are at a slow pace place. Totally acceptable"

The food was ok. Not exceptionally different than any other restaurants like swensen's. One thing to note, servers were inexperience and you could be exasperated that they kept coming to clear your dish when clearly food are still on the plates. They have their rubbish cart places right behind our seating area. I guess that explain why we have the fruitflies kept attacking our food. Some flies even fall into our plates. We were busy shooing the flies away while eating.We were there for long as a family gathering. When we left, 2 mins after we realized we left our daughter's jacket at the restaurant's chair. My husband walked back to retrieve it. To his astonishment, when he enquire with the waiter, clearly a senior waiter (maybe the business owner), the waiter mentioned that he threw the jacket away. My daughter's jacket is a sweet pink clean jacket wore only today! He could thought that it's unwanted and threw into their rubbish cart! It's totally bad service and even not wanting to keep the jacket thinking someone might come back to get it. To come for food to fill stomach and go, probably could consider. For service and food, McDonald's probably is a better place to eat."

It's quite a chill place if you stay on till late, which we did, with our bottle of Moscato. The drinks list is pretty extensive, like it was at Punggol Park. The service is more attentive now that the space is smaller and brighter (the servers can finally see our faces). Beer, cocktails, wines etc are available along with Western mains and snacks and desserts.We had some finger food which were not too bad. In my alcoholic state, i could hardly remember what i ate but i vaguely remember the cheese fries which were quite good and chicken wings maybe? The mud pie wasn't too shady as well.In all, not a bad place to get decent food and wine at affordable prices."

Their menu presents quite a standard selection of western food - grilled chicken, steak, pastas, fish.I ordered their grilled chicken and sausage, priced at $18.90 before GST. The presentation of the dish was pretty well done. However, the taste was normal: nothing good nor bad about the dish. After main course, my friends and I ordered some of their desserts: Choke on Choc and a Banana split. When it came, the portion was humongous. One can literally choke on the amount of ice cream served. We left the restaurant barely able to finish the desserts.I would say that their desserts were pretty good, but the main course meals were a bit on the expensive end, considering the quality of food. Service was slow, even for a a relatively empty restaurant. I recommend Bliss restaurant for some after meal desserts."

The food offered is reasonably tasty, with standard western fare like pasta and meat dishes. Their finger food stands out as awesome tidbits to share with friends and family.

The chicken and pastas are must tries.Mushroom soup and pumpkin soups are awesome.

It's menu boasts the tastes of Europe, and of course realising that this was no fine dining establishment, we weren't expecting gastronomic adventures like never before, neither were we expecting bland attempts at being European in cuisine. We went in expecting the meal to be decently priced and of a decent quality suited for families, students, friends, and young couples alike from the neighbourhood and its surrounding towns.Being short on time we quickly started with the mini sausage platter, approximately $9, which we soon found to be one of the better items we savoured that night. Might I add that the waiters were pleasant, attentive, quick and were men of few words but without being rude. This was perhaps an advantage of our late arrival. The peak dinner time crowds could have left the waiters in a different mood altogether. Both the chicken garlic and chicken cheese sausages were tasty, juicy and filling. Enough to be an appetiser, yet leaving you with enough capacity to pursue a main course.We moved on to get the Zamorana Paella (Beaf meatball ham, sliced garlic chicken sausages and bacon - $13.50) as well as the braised lamb shank (with mashed potato and garden greens - $19.50) to share and we were left with mixed feelings at the end of the night. Having been to Spain I've come to realise that unless you're willing to pay top dollar, paella will never ever quite compare. But I enjoyed this dish, it was moist and tasty, with sufficient meat to satisfy my temporary paella craving. The lamb however, was disappointing. I felt it was a tad bit too raw, and perhaps the meat was not fresh and there was no rich flavour to the dish. I would skip the lamb shank on my next visit.There are many other dishes here to try, definitely heading back there on another occassion where a fuss free meal is warranted, however, I'd probably stick to the more safer and simpler looking dishes simply because I trust they would get it right like they did with the sausages. To be fair based on my first experience there, I am giving them a 3 star rating because I feel that they have yet to wow me."
