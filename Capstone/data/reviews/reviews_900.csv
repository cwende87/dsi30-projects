To customize your Bento, you have to select 3 different items from various cuisines and flavors... from Mediterranean to Asian. I personally was delighted by the choice of vegetables and the 100% tricolor quinoa instead of the usual and unhealthy polished white rice. Please also try the raspberry soda! It's natural, not too sweet and fresh as it should be!"

First all the servers had on this face mask that I believe was intended to prevent them from breathing on the food, but just made the place feel like a hospital. Also, there were a lot of staff standing along the walls with their hands behind their backs just watching the dining room. I suppose this may be more customary in Asian countries, but was a little offputting to me. I mean, who wants to be stared at while eating. Anyway, like I said, most of the good was pretty tasty and came out rather quickly. So all things considered, not too bad."

Place was packed, so we put our name down and they told us to have a seat. After 25 minutes, the manager came up and said it's going to take a bit and thanked us for being patient. We asked for a menu so we could figure out what to order since we thought that would save some time. We were seated after about 40 minutes of waiting and were ready to order but took us at least 10-15 minutes before we could flag down a waiter. We ended up giving our order to the manager. About 5 minutes after we submitted our order, a party of 7 was seated at the table next to us. This is where it starts to go downhill. We are kept waiting and waiting. 15 minutes pass and no one has given us our drinks. 20 minutes after we submit our order, that party of 7 gets their drinks and snacks BEFORE us. We told the manager we wanted to walk but he convinced us and told us he would serve us personally. Our teas come out about 5 minutes after that. After about an hour of waiting our food finally comes out. It wasn't piping hot but more lukewarm at best. They also mentioned they ran out of certain items which we ordered. After our meal we complained to the front desk and waiters who basically stayed silent and didn't say a word. Very disappointing experience. They really need to work on their customer service. I know it gets really busy but don't ignore us after seating us. There is honestly better dim sum options in Singapore so I wouldn't recommend this place."

We ordered the chilli crab AND the butter crab. Both dishes were fantastic! The chilli crab was super HOT and spicy and the butter crab flavor is to die for! Similar to eating New England lobster, you MUST wear a bib or your clothing will be destroyed! Especially with these delicious sauces splattering all over the place as you crack open the crab shells.I must say that even though it was pricey and you could probably find this dish elsewhere in S'pore... it was worth every penny trying this famous Singapore entrêe!

The atmosphere is very nice with a high quality feel and fish tanks. The outside is also quite nice as it is on the water. The chilli crab was phenominal. Very messy but the sauce was so spicy, flavorful, and delicious. Cracking it open and dunking in the sauce was fun and tasty. The only problem was the waitress hovering over us while we were eating and talking loudly awkwardly close. Delicious food with a corresponding price."

It has a nice vibe with a touch of elegance, and I love the wall of aquaria. I had a couple of minor service issues last time, but they are usually pretty attentive. The crab is pretty good, but if you have a crab craving you should go to Melben Seafood instead. I would highly recommend the coffee ribs, the egg yolk prawns, and the home made tofu."

Granted, that it was a Saturday afternoon, I have no one to blame but myself for not going down earlier at 11am.I decided not to wait 1 hour for my noodles and hence decided to try Happy Chef. Like, finally yeah!Verdict:- Chicken Chop - Portion was huge and worth every penny of your $6. Chicken was grilled to perfection, tender, juicy and delicious all at the same time. They were overly-generous with the sauce, but I like it that way. The fries were Long John Silver standard (crispy on outside, soft on the inside). However, my only gripe was that the sauce had a heavy BBQ taste which was too 'sweet' for me. I would prefer something more savoury, especially for my meats. The other side of mash potatoes was unique - sauce was homemade and went well with the potatoes. I felt the potatoes was not mashed enough and a tad lumpy.- Fish & Chip - The fish was fresh but the portion was of average size. Fries was good as usual and the coleslaw fresh. I absolutely hate it when hawkers serve 3-day-old coleslaw, thinking they can get away with it by refrigerating it.*Note that for both dishes, you are allowed to choose 2 sides.It is rather sad to see that this coffeeshop thrives on the booming business of Bak Chor Mee and Happy Chef. While Happy Chef may collect 'spillover' clientale from Bak Chor Mee (like me!), I know of some who will purposely make the trip down just to savour the chops. The lone popiah stall stands miserably empty and the hawkers were swatting flies inside. Pity though, but alas that's the way the cookie cumbles!Great western food but will not make a trip down just to patronise this stall. For Bak Chor Mee, yes I will."

They serve a wide range of Hainanese-style Western food which has been drawing crowds from all over SingaporeOne of their popular items is the Chicken Kiev--deep fried chicken rolled with cheese and ham. At $9, I found the price steep initially but the portion was HUGE. The amount of gooey cheese right at the centre was very generous, and thus stealing the limelight from the leading actor, Mr Chicken. There was no doubts about the crispy chicken coating, but the cheese solidified very quickly and turned into a chewy rubber that dislodged from the chicken. The taste emerged neither from the chicken nor the cheese, but the HAM. Better eat while it is still hot.Nothing unique about the homemade mushroom sauce, as raved about in the video.Perhaps we should have ordered the Fish & Chips instead of Chicken Schnitzel $6. Despite the visible black pepper flecks, the chicken itself was bland and nearly tasteless. Did not help much by the salty chilli sauce. Though the entire cutlet was flawlessly fried, some parts of the chicken skin was uncoated evenly and became very soft & greasy .  We wished we had KFC as we slogged through the characterless meat.I can't be sure whether standards have dropped since it's my first try. (The owners who made TV appearance were not there) Furthermore, I have only tried 2 out of the 30 dishes here. Food not exceptional but the Chicken Kiev is still the better out of the two. And I just realised there is an AMK outlet which is nearer to my area. Hopefully the chefs over there are happier."

My gold standard for western hawker food is chicken chop, and I just thought that the chop was lacking in flavor and the chicken itself was not of top notch quality. I didn't really think the sauce was very good either, which tasted like a bad mix of ketchup and bbq sauce. I also tried a bite of the ribeye steak and was also disappointed.

However Mookata in Bugis Junction is rather new to me as I don't remember seeing such a shop.Soon we settled down and order their Set for 2 at $34.90Interior was spacious and with dining tables by the side of the restaurant, leaving the middle a wide area for easier movement.Decorations in dining area was unique with wooden colorful umbrella hanging upside down. Interior is rather modern and does not have any resemblance in the Thai Culture.Each table comes with a ventilator hanging from the ceiling that helps in absorbing the BBQ smoke. Upon Ordering, the helpers switched on the electricity and let our Mookata pot warms up. A flask of sweet corn soup stock was also provided.What I like about their Mookata is their 3 versions of chilli from non spicy, mild spicy and spicy.Set for 2 was a straight forward and fuss free order. It consists of a combination of marinated chicken thigh, pork collar, prawns, squids, suriyaki, streaky bacon, fishballs, pork belly, meatballs, crabsticks, otah fishcakes, Chinese cabbage, kang kong, xiao bai cai, corn, golden mushrooms, eggs, tang hoon & tofu.Set for 2 - $34.90Looking at the amount of meat on the set, we find that the portion was quite little for us and we decided to top up some of the meat portion.Marinated meat was served in orange tray form which can be stacked up together.Additional Chicken Thigh - $7.50The meat was absolutely fresh and well prepared.Additional Pork Collar - $8We poured some of the soup from the flask into the moat surrounding the skillet. The soup was light in taste but sweet. It allowed the essences of grilled meat juice that was placed on top of the skillet to flow down and mix with it to obtain a rich and flavourful soup. For additional taste, you may opt to have your vegetables and other items mixed in too.One good point to take note is perhaps not to pour too much of soup into the pot while you have your grilled items still lying on top of the mookata as the juices will shoot directly onto your hands or faces. I enjoy Mookata even it may cause me smelling like a walking BBQ food item after the mookata session and with the smell clinging onto the hair that gets away after a few wash."

We ordered set for 2 with extra pork liver and thai milk tea for drink. First of all, the staff are slow in serving and do not have attention to customer. We had to wait  about 10 to 15 minutes for food to come. However, they forgot to serve a bowl of rice until I asked them. Secondly, the portion of food is very small. I did not expect too much but set for 2 is not good enough for 2 person. Moreover, meats were flavorless and seems like not marinated at all. The soup is another nightmare and is over sweetened by MSG. There are three kind of sauses and those are another disappointment. All of them have similar flavor and none of them are good to go with mookata. My overall experience at Mookata was terrible."

I eat here during lunch and always order ala carte. I get that most office folks dig the set lunches which come in these flower shaped platters, but I prefer ordering 3-4 dishes (portions are more than adequate) with friends and it works out to about the same price. Food here is pretty close to what you'd get in Thailand.The fish and prawn cakes here are handmade and fried fresh, just like at Joe's Thai. The tom yam soup is authentic and therefore searingly spicy. Even for someone who comes from a line of chili kings & queens, Jai Thai sometimes gives me a stomach ache afterwards from the spiciness so I usually ask them to tone it down a bit. I also like the steamed tofu with basil chicken, which is a different take on the usual Thai basil chicken. Their prawn tung hoon (which is one of my barometers of a good Thai cook, along with beef soup and fried duck) is darn good too. Basically, I haven't found any dish that wasn't to my liking. Prices are ridiculously cheap but don't tell the restaurant that. Service is hit or miss and if you reach there any later than 12.30pm on a weekday and aren't willing to share a table, go look somewhere else because this place is always packed."

I ordered the Phad Thai since it is a Thai dish that can determine the standard of a good Thai restaurant. The dish was so fragrant that I could smell it the moment they brought it out of the kitchen. To my surprise, the Phad Thai was flavorful and fulfilling. The dash of lime balanced the sweetness of the dish and made it perfect. Also, it was not dry like how most Thai restaurants do it, so it was really palatable.

The chickpea is like the one that you get in an authentic Indian or Pakistani dhaba.The best dish is the karahi chicken which is only made to order and takes close to 20 minutes as its prepared from scratch for every order. A must if you have the time or can do a take away as well.Should try their special chicken fried rice which is very flavourful with large amount of chicken, sauted onions, tomatoes and green chillies.Didn't bother trying any drinks as there is nothing out of the ordinary and are normal items."

The chicken was mildly spiced and the garlic naan was hot and fresh. Finding seating may be difficult at times since this place is so popular with locals and the number of seats are limited by the outside space.

I had the butter naan and at first glance, I was skeptical as I could see the naan dripping with the liquified butter. Not something I would order if I knew it was so high in the cholesterol. When I tore the naan apart, it peeled easily. The texture was soft in the inside but mildly crispy on the outside and it was actually much better than it looked. Even when consuming it without the curry. I also had the chicken masala to go with the naan. This curry was sweet and not spicy. The chicken in it fell off easily from the bone, which is exactly the way I like my meat - stewed for a long time and soft and light on the palette. The curry could have been a little spicier to give it a kick. The teh tarik here is just average and we ordered siu dai to preempt an often too generous dosage of the white matter from the drinks maker. I had a coffee to go too. First time having Indian coffee and I can only say that Indian coffee isn't something I'll ever order again.This place is cheap! You can get all the North Indian food you want - masala, chicken, mutton, naan (all types), fish, whatever here at an affordable price though I hope I haven't spoken too soon less they raise prices. Moderately crowded, all the seats were occupied at 8pm on a weekday night. Will definitely come back to try the other stuff!"

Delicious, and always fresh off the tandoor -- always. They take their leavened breads very seriously. I've been coming here for years and I've never had a cold, stale one. Or one that wasn't delicious.It occupies an entire kopitiam unit at the junction of Serangoon and Desker Roads, so it's bustling, all the time. The staff are efficient, personable and funny; the drinks a touch too sweet, as any north Indian/Pakistani place would be. No night time adventure to nearby Mustafa Centre is complete without cheese naan, chicken kadai, dal fry, pepper fish, haleem and nihari (the latter two sell out early!). It's not quite restaurant-standard clean, but the food is; the surroundings may not be.

Nothing changed. The restaurant is still beautiful, the service is warm and friendly and the food items remain unchanged. and that's pretty sad. We were here for brunch last Saturday before a matinee show at the theater, so we kept things simple and didn't order too much - chicken & biscuit (a southern-style fried chicken sandwiched by a biscuit the size of a standard burger bun with melted cheese topped with a fried egg), a salmon avocado sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Two black coffees to make it a complete meal. One thing about Southern food is that it can get very rich to the extent of cloying if you have it too much, so I would suggest you come in a party of 3 or 4 and share the food. You'll be surprised to hear we can't even finish the food we ordered, as I was struggling to finish the mac & cheese towards the end of the meal. Overall, the food was just decent. Not great. If you ask me if I would return, I will think twice or unless I run out of food options in MBS. A 3-star worthy of an experience only, unfortunately."

So I guess I'm fixin' to just say my peace on the matter and be done with it:  firstly, the bird needs looking at, often it's the ingredient and not the technique, and secondly, the bar needs tweaking if it's going to churn out cocktails from a Southern bar.   The old fashioned I had was so watered down and devoid of flavor as to have been indifferently churned out at a generic airport bar.This concept has a ton of potential and solid branding to back it up, so there is no reason why it couldn't be bigger and better by being entirely different and actually being a roots dining experience rather than selling the illusion of one."

(Miami? That's a little too far South) The menu had almost all the Southern favorites I used to eat regularly when I lived in Atlanta. Fried chicken, collard greens, biscuits, cornbread, shrimp n grits, fried green tomatoes.  The chicken and waffles were good, with the waffles fluffy and the chicken mostly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside (except for 1-2 pieces that were a bit dry). I was particularly impressed by the fried green tomato blt, basically a re-imagined appetizer of fried green tomato slices with pork belly and cheese slathered on top. The peach cobbler had a crisp crust and nice balance of cinnamon and vanilla. It takes 25 mins to get out of the kitchen but I felt it was worth waiting for. Everything was really a high-end restaurant take on traditional dishes, immaculately plated and great service and presentation.The only menu items I didn't see were fried okra and pecan pie. Prices were also rather high, S$45 for the fried chicken n waffles, and S$25 for the peach cobbler. Definitely not your everyday dinner hangout spot.We're pretty far away from the Mason-Dixon line, but I think I found a place to get familiar favorites. 3.5 stars due to the dry chicken and the elevated prices, 4 stars for the good service."

It's a nice decent restaurant and it's not hard to tell by looking at how the host and hostess suited up. I was led to my table after got my name (I didn't have any reservation, it is solely for the purpose of greeting me and to make me feel respected). The waiter who attended to me was very polite and well trained who knows the menu very well. After found out the portion and the wine list, I decided to have the crab cake egg Benedict with a glass of Chardonnay. Trust me, the crab cake is simply awesome. It's not like some of the restaurants make the crab cake with 80% of batter and only 20% of crab meat. This one is opposite, you could get a mouthful of crab meats, so fresh and so yummy and the egg Benedict is perfectly done. It is heavenly delicious when you mix the egg yolk with the lemon hollandaise sauce ... mmmm..... Well, back to the reality ... time to settle the bill.

The menu pricing seems a bit off, as the Swine Burger is one of the cheaper menu offerings at $26, while a plate of chicken and waffles rings in at $45. The burger was all around fantastic--a mix of short-rib, chuck, and brisket, topped with pork belly--and is one of the best burgers you can find in Singapore. The fried chicken is excellent as well, and the macaroni and cheese is a must try.The only disappointment to speak of was dessert. We tried the Mississippi Mud Pie Flower Pot, which was quite small and just OK. At $18, it was hardly worth it, and I would be reluctant to try any of their other desserts, which all seem to hover around that same price point.Lastly, the service during both of our visits was very friendly.

The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was good but the chicken served to us was slightly pinkish still (I noticed this only when reviewing the pictures I took before eating) thankfully, it went down well with 0 salmonella issues! The sandwich comprised of 2 generously buttered slices of Texas thick toast and some pimento cheese, which was really yummy! We shared some buttermilk biscuits, and the biscuits themselves were fairly tasty, the honey butter and jam accompanying it was just okay. The honey butter needed a fluffier texture I think to complement the dougheyness of the biscuit, so a whipped honey butter would've been nicer. All in all, a pleasant meal and I would come back :)"

It's a Michelin star restaurant so you can expect it to be expensive, but throw in the fact that it's located at Marina Bay Sands, now expect yo pay even more than you would in the United States. The steak was excellent. Was it better than the US? But the service, sides, and food are very similar to the states. In fact, they don't even serve Singaporean beer because they want to be like an American restaurant. Interesting! Was it worth the money? It depends what you're looking for. To have excellent service in a high end, fine dining restaurant, and with excellent food, then it's worth it! We love it! In all the street foods we've eaten in Singapore, none ever give us paper napkins. We don't know why. It's just is.

Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate soufflé. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate soufflé. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company."

No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.Interior is modern/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from ""the usual"". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner..

But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative ""mixology"" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their ""spiked"" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause.

We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York.  D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point.  On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair.

Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes."

This review is overdue and I finally found time to write it.I visited the other CUT locations as well and am a regular here at CUT Singapore, in particular the one in Beverly Hills. I found the whole setup and service here in Singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well. If you are used to cold shoulder service, think again and visit CUT!The seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer. The staff was and is always polite, professional and naturally friendly. A 5* experience. Note that it is a pricey experience as well though, think 350-400$ for a two person meal. But worth it!!!You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine. This time we chose an Argentinian Malbec, a pleasure to drink. Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way. The young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always.The steak came, together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach.The highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert. Have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven (or a combination of both) right at the table.So if you are looking for your perfect dining experience, come here and you won't regret it!Enjoy ~S."

Additionally, the complimentary selection of breads, rolls, and breadsticks were all pretty impressive - it's hard not to fill up on them, but you should resist.For our main, I split the porterhouse for two. Not cheap ($178 if I recall), but between two it's actually one of the cheaper menu options. They carve the steak table side, which is a nice touch, and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards. The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat. The steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme, butter, and garlic. The meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite.For sides we had the onion rings and broccolini. Both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner. However, they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal.Service was truly fantastic here. Any request or order we had was met almost immediately. Even our order of onion rings came out a little late (maybe 5-10 minutes after the rest of our order) and they gave it to us on the house.

Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef.I was ecstatic when I discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in CUT Singapore. Even before flying off to Singapore, I already knew what I was gonna have for my steak.My favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye, particularly because of that fat, decadent layer up top known as the rib cap. When my Snake River Farms rib eye came, I was shocked with horror. It came WITHOUT the rib cap. I thought I was just unlucky, and during my 2nd visit, I ordered the same thing, only to face the same nightmare for the second time. -_-The rib eye itself was not that good too. It was too dry, and too chewy and was a great injustice to a Snake River Farms beef.I don't think I'll be back to CUT ever again.

I have an incorrigible sweet tooth, and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle. their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best I've had locally, but it's the souffle that shines - there's some magic in the substantial lightness, and all the textures and temperatures in it. I could wax lyrical all day (and I've done it once before), but really, just look at it - chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate.but you've heard me say all this before - so I'll try to spare you further expostulation. suffice to say that the standard's consistent, the chocolate deep and satisfying - well worth any gym-rat behavior. we also managed two other desserts this time - a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee, chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream; and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream.both were pretty good - and I especially liked the the chocolate-hazelnut slice (though I might be biased as a newtella addict), though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish. small detail though - we lapped everything up. the place is dark and intimate, service friendly and efficient - and really, the prices aren't low but I'm more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions. most definitely my favorite place here. ----------------------------------------------old review:utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss-out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands.

At Cut though, the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers, sides and mains - which are done well, if you need to justify the bill. A hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past $500 easily.When you're mulling over the menu, the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with American cuts in white napkins and Japanese cuts in black. The service is absolutely impressive - if you are familiar with Morton's you'll know what I mean.For wagyu lovers and first timers, I highly recommend the Tasting of New York Sirloin - it includes Kobe style from Snake River Farm (120g), USDA Prime corn-fed (120g), and Japanese wagyu from Shiga (60g). As you can guess, these are pretty tender and marbled choices, so if you prefer something more robust, try the Angus ribeye or such. It's a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone. Wolfgang Puck pops by to Singapore about once a year. so don't expect to see the man himself - instead, he's got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the US to oversee this jumpin' joint. The music's rather loud but we're told it's the way they like it in the States."

But I feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly ""incomplete"" experience, because it is just that good.What can I tell you about the cocktails here? I don't want to recommend a specific one... I'm sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? ""It's not going to be the same.."" I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn't... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails. And if you ever do go, don't forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert -- it's the bomb.Singapore has many cocktail bars, but a few great ones. I count the bar at CUT and the one at Tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail, time and time again."

We often see lots of customers dressed in suits after work so it has never come across our mind that this can be a potential awesome dining place. We assumed it's more of a drinking outlet!Had our lunch here on a Monday. Although they have a lunch menu, we opted for the main menu as well. Apparently, the lunch comes in sets ($22.80) which includes a complimentary FREE-FLOW tapas by the bar with every main course purchased. Also, it comes with either a house special ice cream or coffee/tea. We did not go for this set as we wanted to try something more adventurous from the main menu... Although I must say the tapas bar looks really tempting. Garlic Basil prawns was AWESOME due to the sauce which I believed was prepared with white wine and garlic. Great combination! I would suggest everyone to give this a try. We had 3 pizzas and all were almost equally good but I particularly loved the truffle pizza and pizzoto pizza (crispy bacon and melty egg in the middle)!! The portion was HUGE, each pizza is good for say 2-3 people. For the portion, quality and taste, I think the pizzas are definitely worth the price at $26.80..."

I had the Greg Norman and my boyfriend had the Mexico City and we both really enjoyed the flavors and overall taste. The Wagyu beef on my Greg Norman was well-cooked and juicy.

Just keep that in mind as you read this review. Allergy alert: Worse place is you have food allergies!!!! They use the same fryer for EVERYTHING! So I can't eat the fried that come with the burger, so I have to pay $3 for substituting my fries. NOT HAPPENING!So since I can't eat anything that is cooked in the fryer which eliminates about 75% of the menu items. Now I ordered a coke and they serve it with a lemon inside; seriously!!!! If I order a plain coke I expect to get a plain coke, nothing added to it; no surprises. Surprise additions to food and beverage is a nightmare for those of us suffering from food allergies. Now for the main course. I ordered the California burger, no bun, no mayo (they have truffle mayo), no pickles. Which I may add I am glad I asked because they put them on the side of the burger even though it is not advertised on the menu that they do. Yes, I am allergic to pickles. So I paid full price for a burger and I can't eat any of the sides that it comes with. I only stayed because I could tell my husband wanted to have one of the burgers on the menu. We were told it would take approximately 15 minutes for the food to be ready. I was already starving so the 15 minutes felt like forever. The music didn't help. Thankfully it didn't take that long. I can't believe I paid 22 Singapore dollars for the ""burger"". What made it worse is that I could tell that the server could care less about my food restrictions. Seriously, I am not picky!!! I would rather not end up in the hospital or die after eating at your establishment. This is the 1st place in Singapore where I encountered insensitive people!!!! Music: OMZ!!!! I can't believe I had to listen to that music. We all have our music that we like and don't like, and the music they play is not anywhere close to my choice of music. There are plenty of artists with quality voices, then the ones playing. Like I said, someone else might like that music and that is fine."

However, my experience was very unsatisfactory for price charged.For a burger restaurant, the burgers were very average - at $22 dollars a pop, you expect extraordinary. I ordered the the American which I asked for medium-rare and the beef was still walking! The burger could use more sauce, though on the plus side, the chips were great. My partner ordered the Mexican burger and what a let down it was. It sounded like such an amazing concept but it was poorly executed. The fried onion ring filled with jalapeños was cold and did not fit with the flavour combination of the rest of the burger. When you hear Mexican burger you think - warm, spicy, packed with flavour - yet this burger was not even close. In terms of the menu, I was unsatisfied with its deceptive nature. Beside all of the house beers appears to be a price, hence why I was very excited to order a Californian brew for only $5.9! Yet when I received the bill, there was a $16.70 charge for that very drink. According to the overly-helpful waitstaff, this was in fact the alcohol content of the beer and the price was written in very small font in another part of the menu. If this had been explained upon arrival, I would not have spent such a pricey amount on an average beer. However, on a positive note, my food came very quickly, the menu had a great variety of drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic and to top it off the shakes were extremely large and filling and worth the money."

The wait in line took close to 90 minutes before we got a seat at the bar for 3 pax. Many people who came in pairs were seated quickly so one tip is to go as a couple then you don't have to spend too much time waiting. On to the burgers. The 3 of us ordered the All American, The Greg Norman and the Old Fashioned burger. My ranking in terms of taste is The Greg Norman, All American and the Old Fashioned. Why in this order? The blue cheese in the Greg Norman really brought out the luxurious taste of the wagyu and it was just a great delight demolishing the burger. All patties were medium cooked and it was perfect for the all American if you are just straight up hungry for a good burger. The most disappointing was the old fashioned because the patty was too well done. I supposed with the extra time needed for the cheese to melt and the mushroom to be nicely topped, the patties were more cooked than it needed to be. Another thing to praise is the yummy sweet potato fries on the side. I would go for that rather than onion rings any time. THE ALL-AMERICAN BURGER | $22prime burger, lettuce, tomato, pickles,american cheese, special sauceTHE OLD FASHIONED | $22prime burger, crimini mushrooms, swiss,caramelized onions, horseradish sauceTHE GREG NORMAN | $26wagyu beef, house buttermilk-dill,blue cheese, arugulap.s i prefer shake shack! :P"

If no where else in America could get it right, how could a small place inside of a mall in Singapore do it? I'm not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good.Is it true to form NYC? Not entirely. They're a bit on the small side but boy, do they have a bite to them. The old myth of New York bagel success was something along the lines of ""it's (the elements) in the water"" but was later debunked to be the boiling process of said water and barley to make it truly stand out. Could Two Men be employing a similar method?They claim to be the first bagel house in all of Singapore and started only a handful of years ago. Each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who don't want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability.The bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density. The variety is not impressive to most New Yorkers / Montreal folks, but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar, salt, garlic, and all-sorts (everything bagel). The salmon they're using is not the kind of lox I'd find back home, but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world.For first timers, keep an open mind. This is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the US. Try one of their bagel sandwiches (I vote for the lamb or bo-ssam) and beware of the morning lines."

Walked up to the order counter and just about everyone in the kitchen greeted me with a big hello and a smile. Don't come here if you're looking for a bona fide, proper New York bagel because the owner, Borne, tells me that his bagels are made with the Singaporean taste buds in mind. He's tried bagels from both coasts of the U.S. (probably in between too) and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller. He make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality.

I went with a friend and got 3 bagels toasted, with no schmear, mostly due to the price tag. The schmear costs +$3-5 extra, which is quite significant compared to the cost of the bagel. All three bagels I ordered (black and white sesame, multigrain, and cinnamon raisin) were excellent, tasting fresh and perfect. Will definitely come back again when I have my carb cravings!"

The smoked beef one is particularly good, although being able to go and buy a decent smoked salmon bagel in Singapore still remains one of my favourite discoveries in the relative food desert of Tanjong Pagar.

The layout of the restaurant is very ""chill"" and carefully planned. The menus are written across the wall in chalk, in a font that screams hipster style. You can take your time and read the menu, and I've seen quite a few people (myself included) taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time. When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready. I recommend doing their ""Two Men's Crafted Bagelwiches,"" don't just get a plain bagel with cream cheese. They have gotten so creative with their menu, and I have to say there is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound mouthwateringly delicious to me. I am working my way through their menu, and so far everything I've had is top notch.

Hence upon moving to Singapore, I scour the island every time my inevitable cravings hit. Two Men Bagel is an obvious choice for bagel lovers and you can see from the queue that it's made up of a lot of homesick westerners. The bagels are no where near as massive as in New York and it doesn't have that sheen to it, but then again, they don't have the water. The sandwiches are inventive, bordering on too ambitious. Because the bagels themselves aren't that large, the filling often falls out, leaving your hands a mess. Like all foreign foods swept far from their homeland, it's more expensive (especially the drinks, my God it's robbery) and not as good, but it's all we have. +1 star for the great 90's and 00's rap and hip hop playlist, interrupted only by great 00's emo music."

It did taste different from what I am used to, and was a bit too thick and fatty for my personal taste, but the greens and the relish and the sauce.. very nice. The bagel itself was close to fluffy, but still some density for a good bite and taste without having to worry about an immediate shutdown of any bowel movements which is often the case with heavy bagel dough.Later on I was curious whether roast beef in S'pore is different from what I am used to and went on their Facebook page: there was a photo that showed the Rodeo with pinkish roast beef.

I was all ""hrmph who brings store bought food to a potluck?"" as I cooked my organic sausages from Ryan's when he said, ""I brought bagels"". That made me almost drop my sausages right there.Bagels?!! In Singapore? """"Please tell me it's not those expensive things masquerading as bagels from 'New York' that are sold in Cold Storage?""""Nope it's from Two Man. It's right by my house, I chat with them all the time and they make awesome, as-good-as-it-gets-in-Singapore bagels...oh and try the walnut cinnamon raisin something magic spread in that tub and thank me later.""At that point I was pretty stoked to find the bag contained TWENTY bagels in a gazillion flavors. I couldn't find a sesame bagel (cos I'm boring like that) but I found a brown raisin one, popped it in the toaster and generously spread the magic stuff on. Oh. Ma. Gawsh. Oh. My.I ate that bagel in about a minute. And then I ate a half more.It was crisp on the outside and had a good chew. Granted it isn't New York or Bodo's great, but hey we're in Singapore.

I'd have one (or two) a day every time i'm in NYC (it's my post yoga breakfast staple). I even signed up for bagel baking classes just so that i can make my own (i still haven't though) because nothing in Singapore satisfies my craving. Well Sacha & Sons does a decent one but there is only 1 option (sesame, with garlic herb schmear). I've been meaning to try Two Men Bagel for the longest time, upon word that freshly baked hand-rolled doughs are done here. To determine the quality of the bagel, i had to order them on their own. Bagels are priced from $2.60 onwards. I went with the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Walnut and Raisin Cream Cheese ($4.50) because sweet is always logical with a latte.Well well. Knock knock. The crust was more like a shell, with a slightly blistered crust all around. It was too hard (mind you i'm comparing them to the NYC ones). Plus the dough was a little thin, thus it lacked that nice doughy chew. Flavor wise, it was also kind of strange, with an alkaline aftertaste, possibly due to the almost pretzel like shell. Perhaps i should have stuck with the regular cream cheese because the walnut raisin one was kind of grainy instead of rich creamy and the amount was so little! URGH. #spoiltbynyc Next time, i may just go with the Plain Cream Cheese and Berries Jelly but honestly they need to have more cheese on these.Well Jr really liked the Chix ($9.90) on his onion bagel. The tender house-roasted diced chicken thigh were generously smothered in lemon garlic aioli and peppered with the sourish pickled relish and fresh greens. We both agreed that the filling was delicious but it overshadowed the bagel. It could have been any other bread. In fact, it would have been better if it were a different carb that didn't jab our gums with the hard shell. I had a few bites of the onion bagel on its own and it was rather flavorless, alkaline, and hard. BAH.I really wanted to love Two Men Bagel, but i can't. Can i like it? Maybe. But it kinda ranks the same as the packaged NYC Bagel Factory bagels, which may not be as fresh but at least their crust is better. Go for their bagel-wiches to avoid disappointment. At least it'll fill you up and the filling will distract you from the bagels. Or get the sesame bagels from Sacha & Sons and slather it with your own cream cheese mix."

If no where else in America could get it right, how could a small place inside of a mall in Singapore do it? I'm not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good.Is it true to form NYC? Not entirely. They're a bit on the small side but boy, do they have a bite to them. The old myth of New York bagel success was something along the lines of ""it's (the elements) in the water"" but was later debunked to be the boiling process of said water and barley to make it truly stand out. Could Two Men be employing a similar method?They claim to be the first bagel house in all of Singapore and started only a handful of years ago. Each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who don't want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability.The bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density. The variety is not impressive to most New Yorkers / Montreal folks, but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar, salt, garlic, and all-sorts (everything bagel). The salmon they're using is not the kind of lox I'd find back home, but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world.For first timers, keep an open mind. This is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the US. Try one of their bagel sandwiches (I vote for the lamb or bo-ssam) and beware of the morning lines."

Don't come here if you're looking for a bona fide, proper New York bagel because the owner, Borne, tells me that his bagels are made with the Singaporean taste buds in mind. He's tried bagels from both coasts of the U.S. (probably in between too) and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller. He make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality.

I went with a friend and got 3 bagels toasted, with no schmear, mostly due to the price tag. The schmear costs +$3-5 extra, which is quite significant compared to the cost of the bagel. All three bagels I ordered (black and white sesame, multigrain, and cinnamon raisin) were excellent, tasting fresh and perfect. Will definitely come back again when I have my carb cravings!"

The smoked beef one is particularly good, although being able to go and buy a decent smoked salmon bagel in Singapore still remains one of my favourite discoveries in the relative food desert of Tanjong Pagar.

The layout of the restaurant is very ""chill"" and carefully planned. The menus are written across the wall in chalk, in a font that screams hipster style. You can take your time and read the menu, and I've seen quite a few people (myself included) taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time. When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready. I recommend doing their ""Two Men's Crafted Bagelwiches,"" don't just get a plain bagel with cream cheese. They have gotten so creative with their menu, and I have to say there is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound mouthwateringly delicious to me. I am working my way through their menu, and so far everything I've had is top notch.

Hence upon moving to Singapore, I scour the island every time my inevitable cravings hit. Two Men Bagel is an obvious choice for bagel lovers and you can see from the queue that it's made up of a lot of homesick westerners. The bagels are no where near as massive as in New York and it doesn't have that sheen to it, but then again, they don't have the water. The sandwiches are inventive, bordering on too ambitious. Because the bagels themselves aren't that large, the filling often falls out, leaving your hands a mess. Like all foreign foods swept far from their homeland, it's more expensive (especially the drinks, my God it's robbery) and not as good, but it's all we have. +1 star for the great 90's and 00's rap and hip hop playlist, interrupted only by great 00's emo music."

The layout of the restaurant is very ""chill"" and carefully planned. The menus are written across the wall in chalk, in a font that screams hipster style. You can take your time and read the menu, and I've seen quite a few people (myself included) taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time. When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready. I recommend doing their ""Two Men's Crafted Bagelwiches,"" don't just get a plain bagel with cream cheese. They have gotten so creative with their menu, and I have to say there is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound mouthwateringly delicious to me. I am working my way through their menu, and so far everything I've had is top notch.

Told my colleagues about this place and got her hook up with this AMAZING bagel house. She ended up going to this bagel house almost everyday. Meanwhile, I was busy with my works and didn't start to visit this place until two weeks ago. It turns out to be the best bagel place I ever been to!!! HANDS DOWN!!! They HANDMAKE all of their bagels (which you rarely find it even in the states) Personally, I grew up eating a lot of bagels during my high school years. I always had some cravings when I came back to Asia. Luckily, I discovered this place and all the bagels here are on point. Also, all the staffs are very SWEET and shoutout to Borne for making amazing coffees all the time. Food: a variety of bagels you can choose from. They have some great menus and definitely going to suit your taste buds. My favorite one is LOX bagel and they deliver good quality foods consistently! People & service: I always value customer services more than anything else. I promise  you, you won't regret talking to any of those staffs there!!! I pay a full respect to the business model they have for the bagel house.Keep up with the good work man!!! Will definitely come back visiting when I come to Singapore :)"

On top of that, they serve these bad boys all day long.Prices are reasonable ($8.50 for the piglet) if not a touch pricey given the size of the servings. Taste makes up for that though. I also went out on a limb and splurged on the $4.50 lemonade. It was worth it. I even got a free refill; probably wouldn't happen if I hadn't been one of only 3 or 4 customers on a lazy Sunday, but kudos for the responsive service given the circumstances.The vibe is relaxed and you can see the young staff rolling the dough and tossing those suckers in the oven.

And then they have seasonal ones during the holiday like pumpkin cream cheese around halloween.  They have great breakfast sandwhiches too.  The people are ALWAYS super nice.

My first counter with Two Men Bagel House was during a Yelp event that my friend brought me to (also the event where I downloaded the app and joined the community) where there were coffee and bagels! I had quite a good impression of the menu that they brought over during the event and definitely fell in love with the Jalapeño cream cheese - it is to. die. for. (IMHO*) The bagels that were brought to the event were way beyond the normal plain bagel, and my friend and I were lucky enough to be the last to share a sundried tomato bagel - I highly recommend this because the bagel itself is so flavorful! It was a more DIY / pick-your-own-fillings at the event, which I liked because friend and I decided that we should share the bagel AND have two different flavours in one bagel as we didn't want to take one each - too much bagel for breakfast! My office recently moved to somewhere near Icon where TMBH is located, in fact, we're practically across-the-road neighbors now! And, I had to had down to try at least one other bagel, right? Thus began the quest to find lunch buddies who wanted bagels too - which wasn't too hard because all I had to do was shout 'bagels for lunch?' and I got a few brave volunteers that took the journey to TMBH with me. There was a crowd! It was around lunch time and there were many other brave knights who had braved the CBD heat to Icon and were waiting be around for their orders. Even though TMBH has seats, not many were filled up because office people, we just like to have lunch in office (me especially, because what's a cafe in the office for if we don't use it!) I got myself a Piglet to bring back and I swear, best piglet ever. It's something I highly recommend everyone to try if they're looking for a breakfast /brunch / lunch bagel!* in my humble opinion"

Hello! How are ya?  I was intrigued, and everyone knows you shouldn't go into the grocery store hangry, so.... off to bagel land I went. I asked him what the most popular bagel situation was and he told me two, one was the Rodeo.  I was a little skeptical being from Texas, anything in Singapore called the Rodeo could not like up to that name, right?  But it sounded mildly interesting so I went with it.  The service first of all is super friendly, but they only take cash, or net.  No CC.  My bagel goodness gcame out in a jiffy, and it was REALLY good.  I chose the sea salt bagel (they should sell them to go) and it came with some kind of mustard relish and roast beef I think.  Whatever the mixture, it was good.  I could barely finish it, because it is a meal, but VERY tasty.  My only worry is that if I move in the neighborhood this will up my carb intake, but it'll be worth it!"

But 101 before in baking dough is, dough needs to rise. This gives it that consistency of that doughy taste. Unfortunately there was no rise.

Meanwhile, I was busy with my works and didn't start to visit this place until two weeks ago. It turns out to be the best bagel place I ever been to!!! HANDS DOWN!!! They HANDMAKE all of their bagels (which you rarely find it even in the states) Personally, I grew up eating a lot of bagels during my high school years. I always had some cravings when I came back to Asia. Luckily, I discovered this place and all the bagels here are on point. Also, all the staffs are very SWEET and shoutout to Borne for making amazing coffees all the time. Food: a variety of bagels you can choose from. They have some great menus and definitely going to suit your taste buds. My favorite one is LOX bagel and they deliver good quality foods consistently! People & service: I always value customer services more than anything else. I promise  you, you won't regret talking to any of those staffs there!!!

But since it is called ""Satay By The Bay"" you have to try the satay!City Satay is one of the first stalls you'll see and smell and you can't go wrong with this one. Cheap and great quality satays! The menu shows various set options and a set of 20 is perfect for two people to share. Do note you can mix and match your meat options. I recommend their chicken satay: flavorful, very tender, grilled to perfection, and goes very well with their sauce!Serving sizes are a tad small but the flavor of the satay and the quantity makes that irrelevant. They do provide a lot of the yummy sauce, always a plus!Overall, a convenient location for a hawker with good options. A must-visit if you're craving satay!"

There was definitely a lack of adequate beverage selections at this pavilion, and I did find a place that had a guava smoothie. It was like sludge and the most unappetizing smoothie I've ever had. I don't know what other ingredients were in it, but I begrudgingly drank it because I was that desperate for something that would go down easy. I will never forget this awful smoothie. I still cannot believe I drank it all. I kept thinking I could get used to the taste, but I never did. Because there is so much I didn't get around to trying, I figure there are better dishes around the pavilion, but we eventually went to another venue about an hour and a half later to get different food to make up for what lacked in this visit."

The chicken meat literally fell off the bones.  The jasmine rice was moist, fragrant, and complemented the wings.  Following the wings, I tried an egg and onion briyani from the briyani stand.  The breading was good - soft, fluffy and the onion added a kick to the light flavoring.  If you are an egg lover - like me - the briyani probably could have used two eggs to give it a bit more omelette/egg flavor. Satay By The Bay has lots of other foodie options, including fresh seafood offerings.  There are lots of Chinese cuisine stalls (e.g dumplings, stir fry, and noodles) and most definitely several satay stalls - hence the name Satay By The Bay.  There is also a full bar and juice bar that also offers fresh cut fruit.Lastly, Satay By the Bay has a nice garden surrounding, and is worth visiting if you don't want McD while you are at the Garden By The Bay."

Not just a modern food court, Satay by the Bay brings back some of the old charm of the old Satay Club. Maybe it's the outdoor setting with its wooden stools and low tables or Maybe it's the hint of salt water coming from the reservoir. Which ever it is, it's certainly made Satay by the Bay one of our favourite food joints. While we've yet to try everything here, there are some notable stalls we would and wouldn't recommend. Sri Geylang SateDefinitely our favourite stall of the 6 (or 8?) stalls available here. I suppose Satay is quite selective. We love this store because the meats are well marinated and very fragrant. The chicken is is juicy, mutton too. Beef, a little of the dry side but still very very tasty. City Satay is probably the most popular of the Chinese owned satay stalls. Maybe it's the variety or the fact that they're a well know brand but personally, I feel that he sauce is a little synthetic and factory made. Boon Tat Barbecue SeafoodDefinitely our favourite Tze Char stall here. They have a good variety of dishes but we personally enjoy the BBQ stingray here. Unlike other BBQ stingrays, the chilli used here is more dry Belachan than it is Sambal. It's salty, flavorful and goes very well with the stingray. Another favourite is their Special Fried Chicken wings. Refusing to say what the marinade or batter really is, there is a hint of fermented prawn past. The chicken is nice and crispy and very juicy (except for our last visit where it was a little over cooked). Maybe they aren't used to the crowds thanks to Gardens by the Bay's Christmas Carnival. Another notable mention is Wholly Crab. Opened by local celebrity Felicia Chin, the crab in a bag looks absolutely delightful. Though we haven't tried it personally, the number of people happily digging in and licking their fingers is enough to get my attention and we're going to try it next time! Overall, we love this place. Is it touristy? A little but there's enough good food here to keep the locals coming back. Some items may be on the slightly pricier side as compared to our regular food court or food centre stalls but, it's still worth the walk and definitely worth the price. Satay Party anyone?"

First to start... just walking into this place feels VIP... and the cocktails are phenomenal.The muscat cocktail was my favorite to start with, and the Japanese peach.We were seated in the bar area first and when our private room was ready, we went in. It's pretty amazing that everyone gets a chefs table seat and you get to watch majority of the food prepared in front of you.It's an omakase that consists of fresh seafood and some meat. Dietary requests can be accommodated as well. But I myself don't have any so I just go with whatever the suggest.Chef Tetsuya is mega famous and he is literally the god father of soooooo many world renowned talented chefs. I honestly don't even know if he knows how many of his offspring are very successful chefs with multiple restaurants under their belts in highly populated cities. I've been to many Tetsuya offspring restaurants, so although it was my first time eating at his restaurant and even though it was prepared by one of his chefs and not him, the dishes were embraced by my palette.I left this restaurant soooo happy. Even though we came to celebrate my hubby's bday... I felt like it was mine. Every dish was beyond amazing.I am a big fan of the abalone, the prawn and the Wagyu cooked to perfection as well as their signature dish... the sea urchin, baby Shrimp & Caviar. Just stunning. The seafood bouboulaise with bread was also excellent. I hope to come back sometime in this lifetime!"

They only serve 20 customers at a time, in small 6 people dining rooms in front of a grill and your own chef.Dinner is omakase only with a price tag of 400SGD plus tax, and of course you may wish to pair it with wines (a wine pairing where every dish comes with a recommended wine or sake costs additional 250SGD).Service is elegant but also extremely personal. Since I was dining alone, my server made a point to strike conversation a couple of times, gently and always respectfully. I really appreciated the tone and the courtesy of all the servers.The dinner starts with impressive raw seafood dishes, among which I certainly was amazed by their signature dish, a composition of sea urchin (uni), shrimp and caviar. One of the most delicious dishes I ever had, and I traveled extensively in Japan tasting some of the best kaiseki ryori in the country. Other gems followed: tagliolini with caviar and freshly grated truffle. Abalone gently grilled and then smoked in front of us with cherry blossoms (!). A bouillabaisse of lobster. Delight after delight, concluded by a delicious and delicate ochazuke.Each dish was expertly described, along with suggestions to enjoy its flavor at the best.After dinner, each party is moved to their own table, together with people from the other rooms, in another common dining space overlooking the marina and the famous Singapore skyline, not to mention the light and fountain show. Here delicious desserts are served (pre dessert, main and petit four, in a very customary sequence).In summary, this was a masterpiece dining experience, flawless from start to finish in all its most minute details. The price tag is serious, but I am not regretting a single dollar at the end of this sumptuous dinner."

We split the lobster spaghetti, Wagyu chim over rice and the fried chicken. The Wagyu was so wonderfully fatty you could feel you're gallbladder contract after eating it.

Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu."

I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene. At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (""Ghin"" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of. The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!"

Took off a star because I was only wow'd by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre. Most of the dishes are good, but not memorable. I've been here on two separate occasions. Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the ""menu"", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal.

I had the following (out of order unfortunately)1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist.7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience."

Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once. Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent. The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that. One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening."

However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service.

Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu.  The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience.  In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world.  Now, that's an achievement! The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff.  To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks. Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side.  Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space.  Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline. The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening.  Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms.  This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu.  We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef. The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us.  I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list.  If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin. Our menu:* 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy* Scampi Pasta* Gyokuro Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat.  I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive!  At least we know it's fresh! Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along.  I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal. Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food.  Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth!  Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction.   Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert.  The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Our dessert menu:* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening.  We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening.  A lovely touch and memento. Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience.  From the food, to the decor, to the service.  This is seamless top class dining.  This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come."

(And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway). The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ /10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff. The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite.  For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well."

After a day of sightseeing and getting lost in the Marina Bay Sands complex, sitting down in the Club55 lounge felt like heaven. We arrived at 8 pm right as the restaurant opened and were seated immediately next to a window, which provided gorgeous floor to ceiling views of the bay and Singapore skyline. We were one of only about 5 tables the entire night, which worked out well for us as everything was always stocked and service was attentive. The buffet itself runs $48 per person (about $35 USD), with cocktails and glasses of wine running around $18 a piece. I opted for the wine pairing for $19, which included a red and white wine (both from Chile) as well as a port. The red was definitely drinkable, though the others were a bit disappointing. I'd probably suggest skipping this and going for a cocktail or other bottle of wine instead. There is a self serve coffee, juice, and soft drink bar, though this is not complementary and will be added to your tab. The bread and cheese selection here is solid. They had three loaves of sliced fresh bread - French, wheat (though the placard said sourdough), and one with dried fruits - as well as an assortment of breadsticks and more cracker-type carbs. As for the cheese itself, there were probably about a dozen options. The cheeses were mostly French, though they also had a Swiss Emmental and a few hard cheeses from the UK. My personal favorites were the Camembert and the blue/Brie combo. Rounding out the cheese bar was a small selection of nuts, dried fruit, honey and preserves, and probably the best grapes I've had in a long while. The serving setup was a little awkward, as most of the soft cheeses were presented as an entire wheel, with a few scattered knives throughout so that you can cut your own wedge. I think they also need to come up with a refrigerated way to present the cheese selection, as a few of them did look a little ""sweaty"" as the evening went by. The dessert bar here was an absolute dream. There were easily over two dozen options, and every dessert was presented beautifully. They were mostly individually served portions, though there were a handful of gorgeous cakes, like the cheese wheels, that were presented whole with cake servers to cut your own slice. Highlights for me were the assorted macarons, the dark chocolate and orange creme brûlée, and the assorted mousse cups (especially the caramel+coffee combo and the white chocolate avocado mousse. I also really appreciated that they had fresh grapefruit and honeydew to break up some of the richness. For some reason the dessert bar also had mini Milky Way bars and Hershey kisses, though I don't know why anyone would waste valuable stomach real estate with those.  Overall, this was a fantastic experience, and well worth the money in my book, as just a ticket to the MBS observation deck is about half the price of this incredible spread. And with Singapore (especially the Marina Bay Sands area) being as pricey as it is, this buffet is an absolute steal."

Regarding the setting - it's located in Marina Bay Link Mall - so basically in an underground tunnel which is also a shopping centre with various shops/cafes.  Its not the most relaxing ambiance, but I very much doubt people seek this place out for the amazing setting - the food makes it worth it and the restaurant itself is big enough where you can feel a bit removed if you don't sit right by the window.Overall, great food and consistent quality!"

Cos let's be honest, I don't know about you, but for me eating xiao long bao alone for a meal will never made me satisfied. Yeah yeah I know. I am a girl with a big appetite and I like varieties. I love that though Din Tai Fung is a chain restaurant, but they always maintain their standard really well. The food taste-wise is always consistent.

Partially, because you can never get enough of what may be the best Xiao Long Bao dumplings in the world -- but also as a fan I wanted to compare to the Taiwan and L.A. versions.I will say that they aren't QUITE as good as those two. Mainly because, I understand, these are franchises rather than direct original family owned like in Taiwan and L.A. Also, they've opened a mind-boggling number of them in Singapore. We were eating in a DTF that was mere blocks from another branch in an adjacent mall.Even considering that, it is still 5-stars, because even a lesser XLB dumpling from Din Tai Fung by far trumps the best from anywhere else I've ever had. There is no comparison. I also am an advocate for the thinner, lighter skins they use versus the more traditional thicker wrapping. It highlights the filling.I will say the Singapore restaurants (and Taiwan) have somewhat larger variety than the L.A. branch. However, the juicy pork and juicy pork and crab are unbeatable so it's ""gilding the lily"". Actually, I personally didn't like the truffle dumpling -- which seems to be only available in Asian branches -- very much. I also had the opportunity to eat some other, non-dumpling dishes since my in-laws like the variety and I have to say that DTF also excelled in those as well. Of course, while well executed, these dishes aren't the revelation that their XLB are. I will shamelessly quote another reviewer, Mel P., because they said it perfectly: ""Din Tai Fung should be some kind of universal translations for 'best dumpling ever'""."

Wow, what a big different in between DTF at So.Cal and DTF Singapore. The quality, the taste, the texture of the food and the presentation. Wow, I can't stop saying Wow!The restaurant is crowded, but the service is excellent. +++ Pork dumpling in the spicy sauce: Head down for this one. If I ever mentioned the pork dumpling in spicy sauce is good at So.Cal, I probably never had any better until this one shows up. The flour dough is thin and smooth, meat is juicy, tender, fresh and tasty and the sauce that goes with it is lightly seasoned, but it wasn't bland.You can taste every single ingredients in the bowl. Mr.Q and I ordered 3 times from the same dish. That's how good it is. +++ Truffle xiao long bao:  Normally I am not very fascinated about truffles. However,  this time the truffle did work together with the pork bun. The pork bun has a nice aroma of the truffle and also the freshness and the tenderness of the meat filling. Mouth watering when I try to remember how I bite the xiao long bao open and have a sneak peek inside, trying to not drop the xiao long bao while admire it.  A excellent must try dish.+++ Xiao long bao: The flour dough is thin, the soup broth is the bun is tasty and the temperature of the soup is just nice, It didn't burn my tongue. The pork filling is juicy, tender and fresh. +++Duck roll: Smoked duckling meat in a crispy layer of the spring roll. The duck meat is lightly smoked, chewy(in a good way) and salty, but the green onion and the crispy spring roll balanced the tasty salty duck meat.  An excellent dish.--+ Oriental salad in special vinegar dressing: Crisps greens and soggy rice vermicelli. The sauce wasn't overpowering the salad. However, there wasn't anything special about this dish. -++ Crab meat xiao long bao: It tasted similar to the xiao long bao, however the crab meat texture is a little bit dry and the broth in the bun is a bit lukewarm. +++ Steamed red bean bao: The flour dough looks puffy. The bun was fluffy and the filling were lightly sweetened.  The aroma of red bean and yam is strong and the filling were moist. It wasn't chunky at all.  +++Lemongrass juice was exotic and interesting. It definitely gives you the coolness in the super hot city.The only cons that I can think of this place is "" Dear manager, please get rid of the Christmas decorations from last year"". I highly recommend this DTF for all my Yelpers, if you have the chance to visit Singapore, it's a must go."

First SG review!What to say except that the dimsums were fabulous? My friend and I ordered quite a lot of food actually, maybe too much, but it felt so right as we were eating these dumplings! We tried steamed dumplings with vegetables, pork, shrimp and crab. Also, we tasted the dates filled with rice and the chili wanton soup. My absolute favorites: the shrimp, and then the veggies.Then, we gave a shot to the sweet dumplings and were absolutely amazed by the coconut peanut ones. As for the red beans, they were not too sweet but the peanut was particularly flavorful. Also, we tried the almond and sesame pudding: quite odd to say, but the almond tasted a bit artificial while the sesame's bitterness was just perfect. Overall, excellent dishes for about $60.Only complaint: the service. I don't know if it's considered normal in SG, but the waiters exclusively spoke Mandarin and the bill was also in Mandarin. My friend who lives here was also shocked, so I guess there could be room for improvement.I guess I'll go back for sure just for the shrimp and the peanut. Except if I find another dimsum place that has even more outstanding flavors!"

The chain leaves Crystal Jade in the dust. Honestly, why do people in Singapore still go to Crystal Jade? That's the kind of crazy they don't even have medication for.I, for one, am not a fan of the truffle xiao long bao (this may be controversial). I'm an XLB purist (I don't even need vinegar or ginger) and believe the truffle flavour overpowers the awesome minced pork & fat flavour. Din Tai Fung makes a good, solid, dependable basic XLB and you should order like 20 as soon as you sit down. Per person.Apart from the XLB, I like the pork chop fried rice, the drunken chicken and this prawn pancake thing they have (I forget the name of the dish on the menu). Why people still order dan dan mien here is totally beyond me also. It tastes like nothing but peanuts, people! Check out the braised beef soup also, it's a gem.This particular DTF is an excellent venue for dinner because there is like, never a queue. Imagine walking straight into a DTF without taking a ticket or having to stand uncomfortably, propped up against a mall fixture, in a sea of people waiting for your number to pop up?

I'm also always quite surprised how so many Americans like the food here. It's interesting to see different form of their XLB - chicken instead of pork in the Indon one. I was always fascinated with the XLB that had assorted colors. It almost makes the meal look like it's something to play with - pink, green, yellow, etc.Other then the delicious pork XLB (they actually don't place the ginger in the soy sauce and eat them in Shanghai itself!), I usually go for the lamian (noodles) or fried rice when I am at DTF alone or not with a large group of friends.The lamian is pretty plain, but it's springly and soaks up the broth and tastes so good in your mouth - just plain noodles and broth. The soup is clear and slightly dark, with a thin layer of oil at the top. Scoop up a while eating the noodles to quench your thirst or if the chilli is too hot!I'm generally a happy man when I get fragrant fried rice with succulent prawns. Add some chilli for a kick!This outlet is pretty good but the people in the Raffles City one seem to one you to hurry up and finish your meal so they can prepare the table for the next guests.

It's really pricey at 3.80 per bao but I suppose it will probably have a great aftertaste. The price put me off a little so didn't try but I would certainly recommend anyone to give it a go.I had the duck crepe thingy here and its really good!

Vegetarian does NOT mean mushrooms or gooey tofu here. Not that there is a ton of variety, but they do the few vegetarian items that they do very well. The steamed vegetable dumplings are light and tasty. I love the plain noodle bowls with sauce over them. I believe the dan dan noodles and the noodles with peanut sauce (or house sauce or something) are vegetarian. At minimum, they are visibly meat-less.   Admittedly, it is tough to get the staff to stick around your table long enough to answer detailed questions about the menu or ingredients because the place is constantly busy. Language has also been a slight barrier for me at times in cases where I want to know exactly what is in a dish. There are plenty of plates of lightly sauteed greens on the menu. Yawn. But the surprising favorite in the starters category are cucumbers dressed in some combo of vinegar and soy sauce plus lots of minced garlic. Ridiculous to order simple cucumbers in a restaurant! But I can't always resist, plus I prefer the dressing as a dumpling dip far more than the soy sauce-vinegar-ginger combo I can mix for myself at the table."

We went to LAVO to celebrate our 12th year anniversary. The view was amazing and what saved this rating. We ordered lamb chops (medium rare), with fries for me and mashed potatoes for him. The chops had more fats than actual meat and came with the most undesirable sauce ever. The fats could be rendered more. We asked our server what sauce it came with and was told it was steak sauce. It was mighty sweet and didn't complement the lamb at all. She offered to bring us a different sauce and gave us a few options. I was disappointed that the options were  either chimichurri, bearnaise or horseradish cream. I was hoping for something minty as that would complement the lamb tremendously or a red wine/port wine reduction sauce. So we ended up choosing the chimichurri and the bearnaise sauce to try out. The lamb tasted much better with the chimichurri than the original sauce it came with. Shouldn't the chef know which sauce to pair it with? Since we paid SGD88 for each plate, we expected much more. The other saving graces were the truffle fries and the desserts. My husband ordered the twenty layer chocolate and PB cake, while I ordered the panna cotta. Both were delectable. Overall, we were happy with the view, service and desserts. I wish I had ordered the barramundi instead."

We decided to get a meal on the roof top per a recommendation since the popular infinity pool is strictly only open to guests. You can not even see the pool from were it is gated off. While the recommendation was much appreciated the experience was underwhelming and the restaurant on a rainy day was over priced and over rated. No ""wow"" factor at all. Travel tip- Seeing the hotel itself is a must see. I recommend going to the botanical gardens before hand, and walking your way over. You get a lovely view on the bridge between the gardens and the hotel of the hotel, and the Ferris wheel. We arrived at Lavo between lunch and dinner and went for a drink. Since it had rained the patio outdoor seating was understandably closed there was only one tiny area off the side of the restaurant  that you could see the view outdoors. It was down a few stairs and big enough for maybe 6 people to stand... and filled with smokers so we could not stay to enjoy it. The majority of the restaurant was indoors and on the top floor, but not what I would consider ""roof top"" as there was a roof above us. The name is questionable. It was just like any other restaurant in a high rise. Nothing special, or different from any of the hotel bars in Chicago. I ordered the Dragon Aperoyl spritz. It was very good. It was a $25, and they included nearly $5 in service fees so $30+ total for one drink. (That's quite a required tip for one drink.) All mixed drinks were $25. Wine ranged from $30-$48 a glass. Beers including Heineken and Guinness were $12, coffee was $8. Service was slow to give us the menu, but quick to take my unfinished drink and wipe down the table after 15 minutes before we were ready to leave. In general I do not mind paying $30 for a drink if it's an experience. But there was no experience. No wow factor. No roof top. Not even really time to sit and relax our legs from walking all day through the gardens. Price point largely dictates the expectations for my star ratings. A hole in the wall food stand with $3 pancakes is a different scale than a $30 per drink cocktail bar. If drinks were even $20 each my star rating would have higher, but at this price point I expected a LOT more... like a roof top. Over all the spot is Basic. I would would not make a point to see this spot. If you have time then it's nice. Over all the restaurant was lovely. Modern vibe and interesting drink menu typically 4 star hotel bar. It was not the Uber special iconic luxury that I was expecting, or that the price point warrants."

For the price and location you'd expect more... but perhaps because of the location they just don't care.First off, we made reservations for a Saturday night. It was busy but not overly crowded. We were seated at exactly 8:30p though we had arrived a few minutes prior. Menus were dumped on our table quickly and the person who seated us immediately left. No waitress or waiter came by for 20 min even though our menus were closed. We had no water or anything. We then finally gave up and flagged someone asking for our waiter and she said ""I can be your server!"" We asked for drinks and she rudely and immediately said to hold on... do you want sparkling or still water? Um ok, fine. She took our orders and asked twice if we had allergies to anything. Less than 5 min later, we got water and drinks. And bread with marinara sauce. A minute later...our pastas. That's right. We got all of the food we wanted in 5 minutes. There is no way my pasta was made fresh to order and we suspect that asking multiple times about potential allergies was a way to give plates already made to diners who had no special needs or requests. This isn't necessarily the restaurant's fault but because the food came so quickly we subconsciously ate it quickly, so I felt overly stuffed to the point of feeling uncomfortable. My pasta was cooked al dente but tasted pretty average and certainly not worth what we paid. Our waitress didn't check on us except to ask us if we wanted parmesan. We again had to flag her down for the bill. We were so frustrated and annoyed that we took the option of just putting it on our hotel room bill instead of paying by card since it would be faster. I looked at my watch when we left. It was 9:37pm. That's right, for a relatively upscale place, we were the for 1hr and 7 min for dinner, a third of it spent waiting to just order food. This place is terrible. Avoid. Bad service and average food really ruined our night."

When traveling to or visiting Singapore, you aren't doing it right if you aren't spending some time on the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Head to LAVO to really make your trip worth while!!"

That was justification from them to try and box us into a 5:30pm dinner reservation for our kids aged 15 and 17.  We got another date at 7pm.Next the hostess seated us at the crappiest table - and gave us a hard time even though there were clearly tables available in a section with a better view.  She lied that they had been ""reserved"", even though she told us 2 minutes before that reservation requests can be made but a specific table cannot be reserved when we told her we called for the booking 2 days prior.  We pointed this out to her too. Then she said that the specific table would not be open for 2 hours but came back in 15 minutes to offer the table to us after we had got settled with some starters.  What we could determine was that the section was open and seating white people exclusively, but Asian and Indians were given tables in sections that were further away from the view - not so subtle racism is apparently free on the house!!!Food is absolutely average and skimpy portions - they ensure you have to add trimmings and sides to inflate the bill.  Octopus, tuna and tiramisu were fantastic as was the attentive wait staff at our table.   Brussel sprouts was a soggy tasteless disaster, pizza is more of a flatbread with a forgettable doughy base,but toppings were nice, and gnocci tasted good but was a stingy portion in a soupy sauce that left one feeling vaguely dissatisfied. The nickel and dime-ing continued with the 10% gratuity that is snuck into the bill.The view is spectacular but didn't quite make up for the overall distasteful experience and ho hum food."

I kindly asked the waitress if they had an substantive vegetarian options, aside from the vegetable side dishes. She mentioned pizza and spaghetti with pomodoro. Not a spaghetti fan myself, I opted for pizza with the play-it-safe rationale: ""how can they ever mess up pizza?""Whatever and however it is they did it, they deserve a gold medal in screwing up pizza. I've eaten cardboard that tastes better (yes, when I was a child, don't judge me!).  The crust was drier than my lips get after Coachella... and it tasted worse than a reheated, frostbitten Digiorno.  Awful.Not only that, they charged us for extra garlic bread. I don't mind paying for extra bread, I can afford it. It's just the principle of paying for extra bread at a restaurant that is supposed to be better than Applebee's but doesn't quite feel like it's better than Applebee's anymore after my experience here that irks me.

We were seated in a far back corner which wasn't too bad since there was a fan and even though it wasn't at the water edge we still had a pretty good view of the bay and MBS. We ordered cacio e Pepe ($26), pompano piccata ($42), and burrata ($24). For drinks a friend and I shared the watermelon frose pitcher ($68). My favourite was the burrata with green tomatoes and lime. The tomatoes were kind of spicy and were sort of like tomatillos, went really well with the creamy burrata. The piccata isn't something I would usually order but it was very good as well, the skin was crispy and I loved the trout caviar on top. Service wise- we didn't have the best experience. Understand that they were very busy and I think it might have partly been because our table was tucked in the corner but we were trying to flag down someone for more than 10 minutes with no success. Eventually my friend had to get up to get someone to wait on our table. They were very apologetic though and gave us a free dessert (honey cake) to compensate which we were very grateful for"

We came to this Hawker, went up to the second floor, and didn't have too much difficulty finding this particular stand, because the long line greeted us after a few steps!So you wait in a line. At this time, there must have been at least 15 people in front of me, where it was impossible to see the front of the shop where the menu was. It was a better decision to just get in line. One of the employees is working his way down the line, similar to In-N-Out drive through, where you give your order and payment ahead of time. I told him, ""I don't know what to order."" He said, ""It's okay, we only have one thing to order."" I said, ""Great!"" He said, ""$4."" And that was that. Then I continued to wait until my food was ready in the line, about 20 mins process. The kitchen is fun to watch. They are literally churning out dish after dish within seconds. The lady is either transferring it to a plate for dine-in orders, or transferring to a waxed PAPER, which she then FOLDS UP and places in a bag for the take-away orders. Wow. I've never seen someone so efficient, and also any hot food wrapped in paper like that before!The noodles were delicious, although I can't say it's my favorite dish, or crave it often. It was a mixture of flat noodles, round laksa-like noodles, in a delicious sweet soy sauce base. There were some dried shrimps, some tofu, something crunchy/crispy, and some bits of mussels (which I really didn't care for). Pretty good dish for $4 SG dollars! it's an experience, and you try this place."

Taking the orders early did not shorten the wait other than to make customers waiting in line come up with their orders more efficiently. the proprietor still fries them one plate at a time.. the pork lard was the secret ingredient that made the dish so delicious but their cockles were tiny and on the day I went there they were short on cockles so would not accept the ass on cockles to my order which was somewhat disappointing.

The char kway teow here was moist but not overly greasy. Just the right amount of sweet dark sauce to accent the savoriness, yet not overpowering it, and plenty of wok hei. Finally, the spicy chili gave this simple hawker dish just that bit of oomph. The Ingredients included the usual beansprouts, cockles, fish cake and pork lard. Most notable was, of course, the succulent cockles and ultra-crispy pork lard. Overall, definitely one of the best char kway tiao that I have eaten, and no doubt very highly recommended!"

Its depth of flavor really sets this place apart from other places.The sitch: I suspect I reaaalllyyy enjoyed this lunch because the place was empty (super late lunch) and the servers were still so super friendly and attentive throughout.

I was craving ramen so gave this a shot. It took me awhile to find. I left decently full but found the shoyu ramen to be too salty. Also, the salty and fatty pork cheek added to the saltiness. The atmosphere was nice because you can look out onto the river. The only issue was the waiter consistently kept trying to upsell add-ons to the ramen and dishes to multiple tables around. It was annoying the upsell table by table and then the customers would just say no question after question. They should know when to stop asking in my opinion or just not be so aggressive with the upsell. Which is why I decreased my review from a 3 to 2 stars. Not the best ramen and for the price I could try another place rather than returning. I'll have to update this review when I try other ramen in Singapore. Tip: seems like they're a part of certain promotions with credit cards, etc. It may be worth checking out of the deals and if it's available for Santuoka."

This was their first outlet in Singapore. Their second outlet resides in Cuppage Plaza in Orchard Road. Santouka's founder Hitoshi Hatanaka opened his own ramen shop at Hokkaido in 1988 because he was unsatisfied with all other ramen establishments. Its thin-noodle ramen with elegant broth topped perfectly with mouthwatering slices of char-siu pork and pickled plums gained popularity in Hokkaido immediately. Now in 2015, there's outlets of Ramen Santouka all across the globe and my friends even mentioned the outlet in LA, tasted better than the outlet in Singapore!Looking through the menu you realize that you get to pick your soup base. Be it, Shoyu (soy sauce flavour), Miso (soybean) , Shio (Salt flavour), or Kara-Miso (spicy soybean at $1 more). The dining area of Ramen Santouka is a rather elongated one, that stretches into the kitchen. The chef is able to see every customer who walks in and walks out. And for every customer that walks out, the chef will say thank you for patronizing them. It is very typical of Japanese ramen shops in Japan to be small and compact, so that the chefs are also able to witness the customer's experience with their ramen.Miso Ramen (Medium ) $13.50+I went with my lone favourite Miso. I admit, the bowl looked small, but it was deep. After my first few dips with my chopstick, I realized I was looking at the chance of skipping Beard Papa for desserts later! The broth itself was thick and you could see a thin layer of oil swimming on the top. It wasn't too gerlat, as much I managed to drink quite a bit of the soup. The noodles are the winner here. They are extremely springy. Similar to that of maggie noodles and yet without the waxy exterior that instant noodles give you. The texture of the noodles were consistent throughout the entire serving.  The bambo shoots here were also crunchy and since they absorbed all the flavour from the soup, they sure were tasty!The two glorious slices of char siew weren't fatty at all. Instead they were tender pieces of juicy meat, that again, absorbed all the goodness from the soup.I enjoyed my bowl of ramen as it didn't have me craving for water like the ramen from other competitors which are ladden with MSG leave me."

With so many options and only 1 stomach, I had to make very smart and wise decisions. Every food choice is strategic. It has to be the best if not why bother. There are tons of ramen places in San Francisco Bay Area. However, I always tell my friends nothing beats the options and quality available in Singapore. Outside Japan, I think Singapore is probably the only country with the most ramen shops per square mile. There is fierce competition. I researched and read reviews, strategically planning which ramen shop to go to. Santouka was my final pick! Oh boy!! I was blown away. The egg was perfectly cooked. Nicely set egg white and gooey, soft egg yolk. The shio broth was flavorful and not overly greasy. You can pretty much drink up all the broth and not feel coagulated fat swimming in your stomach. The noodle texture was great and it did soak up some of the flavor from the broth. The pork jowl ... OMG ... and OMG one more time!! one bite and I felt my life is now compete! Well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It tasted better than the pork jowl I had at Lazy Bear recently. I've been to Japan numerous times, ate many bowls of ramen. I must say I'm in love with Santouka ramen."

And I've been there multiple times, in peak periods yes and no, and they were all great gastronomic experiences. Look at the picture of the pork cheek I've taken. I call it angel's wings for a reason. The texture's so soft and feathery, it melts in your mouth, instantly warming you up from the inside and taking you to the heavens. The taste of the meat is distinct, the moment you eat it, it's there in you for life. The soup's thick and heartwarming, the flavours are well-mixed and the noodles have a springy consistency that keeps you going after many spoonfuls.The eggs are another level of genius. You HAVE TO buy the extra eggs to try.There's free plain water that comes in a JUG for you (woots!) and if you can, get the seats that overlook the Singapore River. In this way you can check out the great night view outside and also turn to your left to revel in the open kitchen - the mastery of the chefs.

And having had the chance to dine at Ramen Santouka in Harajuku when I was on a holiday, I can attest that the service levels and taste are all exactly the same. One must-have dish is their speciality 'toroniku' or pork cheeks ramen. The pork cheeks come on a separate plate with condiments from the ramen (available in 3 different soup bases - shio, shoyu, miso) so you have the choice of pouring everything in or dipping them in one by one. (i recommend dipping - it just tastes better!)

It's also served with a mini-sized cup of tea, which tastes like a normal Chinese tea. Please go to my blog to see photos!!

I really love love the Pork Cheek, it's so tender and tasty in a melt-in-your-mouth kind of way. Tried shio and shoyu broth and I prefer the shio because its cleaner tasting and is less salty vis-a-vis the shoyu. The portions they give for the noodles are huge! I was starving and yet couldn't finish.Only reason why this place didn't get a 5-star from me was cos its slightly on the pricey side and there was a long queue (so if you're starving think twice about eating here)"

The dozen or so times I have visited on a weekday evening there is a long queue, thankfully the table turnover is high, so the wait is never more than 15 minutes. I am a ramen lover, and for a decent bowl outside of Japan, this place is my normal go-to when those cravings become unbearable.  Being a Shio Ramen fan, I'll be honest in having no idea what the other items are like.

Service is almost invisible during busy times, though a great tasting bowl of ramen and pork cheek makes up for those short fallings. Jump in the queue and you won't be disappointed."

Best part of the set is that it comes with a side of pork cheeks (super good. specially imported from the US. it literally melts in your mouth) 2.

Despite the crowd, service was good as the staff were efficient without being brusque. This really is a get in, eat, get out sort of dinner though so if you're looking for a more relaxed pace, you're better off elsewhere. It really is all about the ramen at Santouka. While Santouka really does serve up a good bowl of ramen, I do think there are better ramen places out there. I've learnt, though, that ramen preferences can be very subjective. So while I found the ramen a bit too chewy on the chewy-springy spectrum, some of my other friends loved it. And while I thought the broth (the Shio broth) was super tasty, some of my other friends thought it was a bit too rich and salty.But we all did agree that the egg was tasty, though the yolk a bit too gelatinous. And the pork cheek was fantastic and and just the right proportion of fat. The portion is quite large though. So if you're ordering the pork cheek ramen, I would recommend ordering the smaller portion if you don't have a huge appetite."

S declared this the best ramen in Singapore even before we tried several other popular ones like Marutama and Ippudo. The verdict still stands though. The Santouka brand, which was started in 1988 in Asahikawa, produces the best Hokkaido ramen on our little island. Despite the secluded and hidden corner in Central Clarke Quay, the queue gets pretty crazy during meal times due to the small capacity (it's about a 25seater) and insane popularity. I think it has only gotten better with the opening of a second outlet at Cuppage Terrace. If it's your first time to Santouka, i highly recommend the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen (S$19.50 for shio/shoyu/miso, S$20.50 for Spicy Miso). For that price, you would get a dish of roasted pork cheek and a bowl of springy and curly yellow noodles. Sides sold separately. The jowl meat is the most precious and delicious part of the piggy. It's only about 200-300g per pig (duh, they only have 2 cheeks!) Very richly flavored and tender! This texture has been likened to fatty tuna. I would say the meat is more firm (this is pork not fish you know).Best ramen still. Ippudo doesn't come close."

It comes with a thick broth that tends to be too salty to drink but you can dilute its saltiness with tea and drink it as a soup. Oh yes. Don't forget to pair the ramen with a plate of their pork cheek slices.

Based on others reviews I ordered the ramen (shoyu) with pork cheek and a side of the soft boiled egg tamago thing. The service was super quick - but should be since all the ingredients are already cooked. The ramen broth was very substantial, more like a soup than a broth. Taste was excellent, and I'm sure a lot of that great flavor comes from the oils floating in the broth. This is one of those dishes that if you don't finish it (you should finish it though, it's really good) and put it in the refrigerator it'd probably have a healthy layer of fat congealed on the top the next day. Also known as Good Flavor. The pork cheeks, contrary to everyone's comments, does not actually melt in your mouth. There is a little chewing required, albeit not as much as, say, a pork chop of the same size. The cheeks are really flavorful. Fat, pork and salt, how can you go wrong? Everyone loves bacon.  Either you love it or you don't know you love it.  But you do love it... This is bacon for kings. I would eat the cheeks off these pigs any day. The egg was also good (for a hard boiled egg). I liked the creamy center. The marinade used to flavor the egg is very subtle and not overpowering.  I love them, I should have ordered another. This place is kind of difficult to find - at least it was for me. But if you are stubborn (like me) and have ramen on the brain (like me) you'll get there.  I had to walk through a different restaurant just to get there.  And then on my way out I felt sorry for all the fools eating at that other restaurant.  They should've gotten ramen."

The cha siew and chicken were cooked well, the chicken was tender, and the soy sauce was SWEEEET, so it's a bit different than what I've had; I think honey might be in the marinade recipe. I prefer the cha siew over the chicken because the flavoring was bomb, but the entire meal was very satisfying for me. The reviews here are mixed but I actually enjoy and appreciate simple + affordable foods and that's exactly what Chef Chan's belief is. I'm pretty glad a non-expensive nor fancy fine-dining restaurant like simple Hawker Chan received a Michelin star.

It's cool that this restaurant is in Chinatown, so you can shop and continue your food journey while in Singapore.After waiting in the line that was literally out the door (roughly 20 minutes), I ordered the soya chicken and rice, which is what gave this place its Michelin star.  When I finally received my food (about 10 minutes later), I struggled for a few minutes finding a table.  This place is packed! Seriously, good luck finding a seat, as people tend to ""save"" them for their multiple person families. Kinda rude, but smart. I will say that the chicken was good, but not very unique and definitely not worth the wait. It was roasted chicken, rice with soya sauce, half a boiled egg, fresh slices of cucumber, and roasted peanuts. Super random items and plating, but I suppose when they are churning out hundreds-plus plates a day they could care less. There are tons of other hawkers that serve the same food and you'll get it in 5 minutes without a wait.Suggestions:  Take your food to go and go sit on a bench or in the food court nearby to eat it.  It'll save you time and energy from wrestling for seats with other foreigners.

You can opt in to wait in line with the cashier or order via the automated machine. The machine is is easy to use from what I saw so it's a good option if there happens to be a long line.Service: Super Quick, mostly self service. Longest part of our wait was to order. Tables turn over extremely quickly too because the busboys keep an eye on the tables well and take empty plates immediately then wipe down. Post ordering your receipt comes with a number and when your order is ready it pops up on a screen. Go back to the pick up area next to the cashier. Then lady there was nice and repeated my order to make sure it was correct and then took the number portion off my receipt. 5/5Ambiance: Loud, but much cooler and nicer then it would have been across the street if it was still in the Chinatown Complex.*Note: DO be prepared to split a table with someone. There is limited space and we all want to eat our food and go ^-^Eats:Roast Chicken Soya Noodle 5/5 Savory, tender, and moist. Probably one of the best versions I've had of this dish. Definitely good and well worth the price. The noodles are also well worth mentioning here. They are soft but still chewy! Delicious with just a bit of the ""BBQ chashu sauce"" that comes on the side.Roast Pork Rice 5/5 I actually enjoyed this much more then the chicken. As a kid I loved roast pork more then roast chicken simply out of laziness haha no bones versus bones! Haha so I do have good memories with this dish. However Hawker Chan's roast pork is different in that you can really taste the spices in a good way. It's extremely aromatic for something that is usually so simple.*Note: Hot sauce, soy sauce, and chilis are available directly to the left of the pick up station. This is also where you get your chopsticks and spoon.Overall would definitely return even with the price hikes given it's new location and fancy ordering system because it's still a destination and achieved something never done before."

It's clear that there's only one thing you really order there, and it's the soy sauce chicken. The real question is do you get a half chicken or 2 chicken with rice. We opted for the option that maximized this heralded bird. The order seems to be streamlined quite well and they called our number within 5 minutes of ordering. It was really good. Was it worthy of a michelin star....I don't know about that. Was it worth 7 bucks, **** yea it was. There was no piece that wasn't juicy, tender, and soft. If you're familiar with Costco chicken, think like 5 times more tender without any notion of strands of meat. I honestly have no idea how it's possible to be this perfect. Normally you have to fight for the red meat, but this chicken was just perfect everywhere. No discrimination! The soy sauce complemented it well and obviously went well with the chicken. It didn't seem fatty at all either, so seems like a dish I could eat every day of the week. If you start getting familiar with hawker costs, you realize this place is double the price of other chicken, is it twice as good, probably not. Would I go here vs other ones with limited time? No question."

(Hello from Los Angeles!) Of course, I also have heard of this place because of the Michelin guide and it being the first hawker stall receiving a coveted star. I had to try it all - the soya chicken, the char siew, the roasted pork, and more. I had the soya chicken plate with the rice ($3.80 SGD) and the 3 way platter which comes with the char siew, roasted pork, and the pork rib ($10 SGD). It was amazing. You could really taste how different the soy sauce brew is, in comparison to other restaurants. The sauce is sweeter than most but with a very unique spice floral undertone. The char siew was amazing as well because of that unique soy sauce brew. The roasted pork is like any other in SG so you can totally skip this because I think they just have this, just to have people order it.This place is crowded on the weekends and getting a table inside is quite difficult so to avoid the chaos, the best thing to do is order your food as take out and bring it with you to the nearby Chinatown Food Street. Tons of outdoor seating during the lunch time and you can enjoy the meal without tons of people surrounding you as they queue or wait for you to leave and take your seat.This place wins for the price and their awesome product.

The restaurant is extremely crowded (surely due to the Michelin Star) and you have to stalk a table to sit down. Food is prepared quickly but generally you will need to share a table with a stranger and have someone standing over you waiting for you to finish. It's not worth the hassle in my opinion.

In case you don't know, Singaporean's consider this dish to be a National Dish. You definitely need to try it while in Singapore and why not go to the best?There are several locations and while this is not the original, I am almost certain that this is just as good. We didn't know that there was more than one location and we just put the name in Grab. The driver informed us that this place is really great. You can only imagine how confused we were to pull up to a mall vs Chinatown. However, it was 90 degrees outside and thought this was just fine. We wanted to beat the rush and arrived about 10:50am. There were about 10 people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly.The menu is pretty basic, you'll pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles. I went with their famous chicken and rice. The soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory. Served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce. It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken. However, that probably is what made it even tastier. An order of this dish sets you back about $3.50USD which is absolutely crazy talk. I don't know how they keep it so inexpensive. This is a must visit...but if you want to keep it authentic, head for Chinatown (although I am sure they taste the same)."

Yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses. The food stall is located on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex, which is across the street from the air conditioned sit-down restaurant. The reason I chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is ""supposedly"" better. Also, if I'm going to come all the way here - it's better to eat at the original right? (Especially since Hawker Chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world). The soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a Michelin Star. At the stall it is S$2.50 (super cheap for a Michelin Star meal!) I also ordered a char siew rice which was also $2.50. There are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice, roasted pork rice, and the chicken hor fun. Most dishes are S$3 and under. Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well. I love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate. Was it amazing? I'm not sure. There are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious. I'm not sure what makes the chicken stand out. The char siew, however, was really good - I liked it more than the chicken.Overall, I think my expectations were too high because of this place's popularity and its star. The only reason we came here was to try the ""cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world"". I'm not sure if I would come here again and wait in the really long line. Comparing this place to other one Michelin Star restaurants I would give it a four star (good food at a very cheap price). Comparing this place to other Hawker stalls I would give it a five star."

We ordered the soya chicken with rice, roasted pork with rice, and soy sauce vegetables. As a Cantonese I pretty much grew up eating roasted meats and chicken and I have to say the food quality was underwhelming. The chicken wasn't really tender and actually somewhat dry. Same thing goes with the roasted pork: there could have been more layering with the lean and fatty parts so the meat isn't too dry. You can't beat the price of $5 but honestly there are so many hawkers in Singapore that offer much cheaper and flavorful options.The seating/lining up situation was also very hectic given that there were a lot of people trying to find seats with trays of food in their hands in a very cramped space. It was an interesting experience given the chain's fame but honestly I wouldn't be back."

My wife ordered the famous soy chicken and rice while I got the meat combination platter. Normally my wife isn't a fan of soy chicken, but she said this one was exceptional. The chicken was moist and the rice with sauce was a perfect accompaniment. I ordered noodles to go with my combo platter of meat (Char Siu, roast pork, and roast duck). The Char Asia was by far the best piece of meat on the plate. The roast pork and duck were also good, but nothing stand out.

It left such a strong impression on me that I now refuse to order soysauce chicken back home because I know I'll be disappointed. The chicken is so so so so tender!!! I ate the white meat, yes the white meat and it was juicy and moist!!! The one place I don't mind eating white meat chicken instead of dark! That says a lot for me. Also the soya is sweet and savory. They pour the same sauce over with your rice or noodle. I do wish they gave a little more chicken though. After my first visit, I had to go back and get half a chicken. I also got a side order of the roasted pork and the Cha siu. Each time I've ordered these, they were always very flavorful and juicy. The pork was super crispy and the burnt ends of the cha siu were delicious.Now I'm salivating and hungry and craving all this as I finish my review.

I should've skipped the char siew because it had bones in it and the chicken rice was more than enough. Just enough fat but not too much to take away from the juicy flavor. I just wish it had a little more meat in it, but that's because I'm used to the larger portions in general in the US.

You won't find a cheaper Michelin-rated eating establishment anywhere in the world. For the famous See Yao Gai Fan (soy sauce chicken rice), it's S$2. With the current exchange rate, that's about $1.50 USD- it's pretty much free then. The chicken itself is fantastic- definitely higher quality than what your typical HK BBQ shop would offer. The chicken here is plump and succulent with gushing taste. Another thing, I'm surprised that no one talks about the char siew. This breaks into my personal top 3 char siew experiences. It's got a perfect balance between meat, fat, oiliness, marinate, and sweetness- it just melts inside your mouth and the outside has a good burnt char appeal. If you get the chicken rice, I strongly recommend the char siew as a side. They actually open at 10am, and regardless of the day of the week, there's going to be a long line. The original location, where you can see the owner, is found in the Chinatown Complex Food Court. There's another Hawker Chan restaurant set-up outside on Smith Street, which for some reason, has the same offerings but at a premium. Not sure what that's all about, but your best bet is to just go to the actual original hawker in the food court. Anyways, for what you're paying and what you get, this place is great!

I had the chicken and rice plate. The food is very simple, with straight-laced Chinese flavors.

I ended getting a portion with a ton of bones, whereas my bf said his was boneless. The rice was cold and hard - blegh! Was disappointed with this dish.-Roast pork with noodle: I enjoyed this dish more than the soya chicken dish. The noodles were tasty and the pork skin had a nice crunch to it.

I was a little confused when my googling brought us to this location that was clearly not a little stall, but instead a newer location opened up after the success of the stall. We weren't sure if we should just eat here, or go find the original stall.A little research brought me the following information (I can't guarantee it is all true since I didn't actually go to the stall):+the food tastes pretty much the same at both places+the food is more expensive in this store+there is a much longer wait at the original stall (and no AC!)After weighing the cost/benefits (the big one being AC), we decided it wasn't worth it to try and find the original stall.So we got in line and ordered:+Soya Sauce Chicken Rice ($3.80): a simple dish, but the chicken was actually really delicious! The meat was tender and full of flavor. The soy sauce flavored rice was also simple, but a good addition.+Pork Rib Noodle ($5.00): the sauce was on the sweeter side, with the option of mixing in the spicy sauce (I didn't). The pork rib was probably my favorite of the pork meats we tried.+2 Combination Platter (Char Siew and Roasted Pork) ($6.00): I wasn't too impressed with the meats as they were both quite dry and not that flavorful.+Seasonal Vegetable ($5.00): pretty basic dish, but helps to keep the meat from being too overwhelming. Nothing amazing, but it was done well.+Roselle Tea ($2.00): this tastes a lot like suan mei tang (not sure of the English name). It is sweet and tart (similar to cranberries maybe?). Im personally not a huge fan.The food was good, and I left feeling satisfied without needing to break the wallet. That being said, is there probably better food out there? Very likely so, but at least you can have bragging rights about eating at a Michelin star restaurant! I would definitely recommend trying it at least once if you're in the Chinatown area."

Soya chicken from my hometown is so... dry that I would never order it, so my thought was how can chicken get better.. especially to the point that it deserves a star.If you want the full-on experience, you must go to the original hawker stand on the 2nd floor of the building across the street, but it usually has a longer line and opens later than the new chain restaurant opened on Smith Street. Also, if you are price conscious while on vacation, the stand is cheaper: - Soya Chicken DishAt Stand - $2.50At Franchise - $3.80- Half a ChickenAt Stand - $7At Franchise - $12We tried both places and think the food is pretty comparable. The franchise is more to make money from tourists for the investment firm that approached the chef (I believe the chef gets 30% of profits or 30% share of the business). You can get angry at the price difference, but you got to give the man props. Now, he'll actually make money for about the same amount of work. My group also tried several of the Soya chicken stands in the area, and they do not compare. For me, its all in the texture and flavor. The chicken is tender while succulent and reminds me of roast duck, but with the heavy flavor of soy sauce. Delicious!I'd definitely recommend the trying either location.

This is the first restaurant of recently rewarded Chef Chan who is a Michelin starred chef! His hawker stand which is rated ""cheapest Michelin starred food in the world"" is not far front this restaurant. See Yelp link here:yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-s… We chose to try this restaurant as it just opened Nov 2016, and I've got to say that the soy sauce chicken is superb. It is nice that it is air conditioned as well. We got there and the queue was not that long outside but when we left it snaked around and was on the street out of the queue barriers. There is a queue outside the door, and they let you in in bunches so you don't overwhelm the kitchen and ordering. You either order at the counter register or get helped by someone at the ordering machine as well. Both seems effective and decently orderly. You order, pay, get a number, then, grab your seat. Your number gets called and you pick up your order. Utensils, hot sauce, straws, chilis, are self service too. The neat thing is Chef Chan was there putting out the food from the kitchen too. There is a variety of menu combinations or alacarte you can choose from but basically soy sauce chicken, char siew (BBQ pork), roast pork, roast pork ribs. Then there is rice, wonton noodles, hor fun (wide flat rice noodles).  Then veggies and drinks. We ordered a full chicken (S$23), 2 combination meat of char siew and roast pork (S$6), rice (.8) and wonton noodles (1.5), and two drinks. We basically had leftover chicken and a few pieces of the others but we knew that'd happen. Overall, as expected, soy sauce chicken their specialty, was by far the best. One of the best soy sauce chickens I've ever had. Weakest was the roast pork in my opinion but still good. Because of the air conditioning, the wonton noodles (which are served dry with the soy sauce chicken sauceon it) didn't stay as warm as I'd like but still was good. The rice with the sauce was good with the chicken too. I'd recommend stopping by and queuing for this whether it be the restaurant or hawker if you're in Singapore. Given that it's S$3.80 (around $2.50 usd) It is super affordable and yummy. FYI/ hawker stall info is in the link above and very near the restaurant is: Hawker Stall: Blk 335, Smith Street #02-126, Chinatown Food Complex, Singapore 050335Opening Hours: 10:30am to 7:00pm (Mon - Tues, Thurs - Fri), 8:30am to 7:00pm (Sat - Sun), Closed WedTip/ cash, credit, nets which is great for versatility of payment Tip2/ must try the soy sauce chicken Tip3/ very near the Chinatown MRT (purple North-east line) I believe exit A toward smith street is the proper exit."

Maybe I got very unlucky thoughFood: I ordered the basic rice and chicken combo, added some roast pork and a flower tea for S$7.80 total.Soy sauce chicken was more of a sweet style and lacked any real depth of soy sauce flavor or savoriness. You could tell than there were aromatics in the braising liquid like orange peel. The chicken was tender but almost to a gelatinous, slippery feel and the chicken flavor was masked significantly by the sweetness of the sauce. The hot sauce is also quite sweet and not really worth using.Roast pork was cut into nice small pieces and had a fairly good ratio of lean meat, to juicy meat, to crackling did lack a bit of crispness- it was a bit more of a stale crunch, but still decent.The sauce on the chicken isn't just regular soy but you can taste the seasonings from the braising process which is nice.The tea has too much sugar and not enough flower- would not recommend.Service/Experience:Staff is woefully unprepared which is why everything is so slow. The kitchen is actually very fast and all the food is ready to go but the actual point of sale system seems to be flawed and this is why the wait is so damn long. One cashier started taking my order but was abruptly stopped by someone else. One of the cashiers doubles to clean the dining room and let in the next batch of customers.

But I really appreciate some of the most down-to-earth restaurants that have gotten a Michelin star. For example, I gladly went to one in Hong-Kong. And in Singapore this Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle spot is sorely unassuming, but it must be doing something right to receive that star. The reviews are so mixed, it bewildered me. There are a lot of folks who like it and many who do not and call it overhyped. I ordered, I felt like, the signature dish on the menu. Yes, surely the classic soy sauce chicken. That's their claim to fame dish and they would sell this dish at their first stall for 2 SG dollar a plate. Later they raised the price to SG$3.80, but the extra cost goes into the overhead like the air conditioning, nice seating, etc. So essentially it's still a SG$2 Michelin star meal. The chicken looked beautiful, the colour looked  right, there was a bunch of sauce in the rice itself along with some soy beans. The rice was fluffy and tasty, the sauce's taste was uniquely sweet and much deeper than just mere soy sauce. As for the chicken, it's highly tender white meat, neither dry nor juicy. All in all, worth it notwithstanding long lines!"

I ended getting a portion with a ton of bones, whereas my bf said his was boneless. The rice was cold and hard - blegh!

I understand that's part of certain chicken rice recipes, but not as enjoyable for me when I'm constantly picking bones out of my mouth while trying to eat. More importantly than the bones, though, is the fact that the chicken was literally cold when I got my plate. I don't know if this is part of their recipe, but I thought it was kind of gross to eat. Chicken rice should be HOT. Serving size was good, and you'll get to say you've eaten the ""cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world"", but I can honestly attest to the fact that the chicken rice here is just not that good."

Located within Singapore's Chinatown, it is a close walk to many other hawker stalls serving up all kinds of Asian fare. The key to this place is to get here early, as I showed up 45 min before it even opened and there was already 15 people in line. The food is good and well worth the visit, I ordered the chicken and rice plate as that was their most notable dish. The prices are reasonable so I would suggest stocking up on two plates and sampling something else on the menu. Singapore has plenty of Michelin rated restaurants, and other great dining options so make sure to explore around and find some hidden gems within the city."

I realize the Michelin star was awarded to the original location in the actual hawker center, however the adding of locations must have have a negative effect. Honestly, it was easily the worst food we've had in 3 days in Singapore. The chicken was not very tasty, yet it was juicy. Perhaps because to us, it seemed undercooked. We had seen videos and saw some redness in the meat, but this was a little much. Rice was basic, sauce/gravy didn't really add anything. Sadly, the half egg was the best part.

'16.  I went to the original store around 1;30pm on a weekday.  It was closed and was directed by a sign to their new location which started less than a month ago during the end of Nov.  Many people like me were caught on a surprise,  Anyway, it was a short stroll from the hawker center to the new location, basically across Smith Street of Chinatown Complex where the hawker center is.  Wow....  the line was long, spend more than an hour to get in just to order.  And as you can see why a 3 stars?  Here's the summary....Service - The staffs were very unpleasant, somehow they were all burned out(This new store was opened less than a month ago when I came) or they were way under paid.  From the staff for maintaining the line to enter the restaurant(Just to enter the restaurant for standing in line to order).  The staff that guild you ordering via a kiosk and he will not let you touch it.  I tried to order myself as he was sllloooowwwwwww, his mind is like 20% working and the 80% thinking about something else, not work related I'm sure.  It's just a koisk, I know how to press on the things I want, there's picture too but he gives me the look.  Fine, after order and received a pager, attempt to locate a table while waiting for my food to be picked up.  As I was waiting, I saw the staffs were slow at cleaning the table, they were upset at people who removed used plates and placed on unoccupied tables.  People were cleaning tables themselves as they were waiting for the food.  When the pager rang, time to pick up my food and asked the staff for condiments as it was almost empty.  The ladies just replied 'Ok' and ignored me, I waited for more than 5 mins before someone came to fill.  I believe the other popular Chicken Rice store in Maxwell Food Center did a better job organizing.Food - The Soya Chicken was good but not to the extend for waiting for more than an hour or to die for.  I do like the taste but it's a little too sweet for me.  I don't mind the saltiness.  The chicken mixed well with either rice or noodle.  That's the only reason for a 3 starsPrice - Way to high.  I am not comparing this with a hawker food center prices but a typical food court in a mall.  For the portion provided with respect to price.  It's consider very expensive.  Generally, a plate of chicken rice/noddle comes with about a quarter of a chicken.  Therefore a chicken can serve 4 plates of chicken rice/noodle but for them, for a chicken they serve 8 plates of chicken rice/noodle.  You can imagine how little chicken you get.  For 2-3 person, I will suggest half a chicken to share and not chicken rice/noodle plate.  You will laugh at the portion for one person.Conclusion - Way overrated.  If you do visit Singapore, and you have not come here before, I will say do visit this restaurant but do plan according.  Standing in line for more than an hour is really waste of time.  Or to die for.  Do not expect service.  I believe hawker center do better than them."

To be fair, this could be my fault. I ordered the 3 BBQ Combo item. This included BBQ pork, Roasted Pork Belly and BBQ Ribs. Maybe I don't quite understand what Michelin means, especially for a ""hawker"". It's only after I sat down and looked at the screen and realize that they are known for their Soy Sauce Chicken. I thought Michelin stars for for the restaurant as a whole, not just one dish, but I could be wrong. Maybe the Soy Sauce Chicken is worth a try. However, I can say for an absolute fact that the 3 BBQ Combo I got was just pure trash. BBQ pork was not marbled in anyway and was completely dried and lacking in sauce. Roasted Pork Belly had barely any fat between the skin and meat. On top of that the Skin was dry and damp instead of having that oily, crisp crunch. Ribs were dry as well and also lacking sauce. As someone from the SGV area of SoCal, even he most average Chinese restaurant tops this place.Service (5): The line to order wasn't too bad and moved quickly. For some odd reason people were lining up to order with the cashier. But there was a order machine right next to them. I skipped the lines and made a quick easy order using that. I really enjoyed that and am a sucker for innovation so I am giving it a 5 because of that.Ambiance (3): You will notice I put hawker in quotes on the food section. This is because it's not really a hawker. It's a restaurant. Maybe at one point it was a hawker stall at the hawker centers, but not anymore. It's just a regular restaurant. Nothing special about it. It's pretty bland, but at least it's clean.Price (4): Decent and cheap price. However, this is an American's point of view and food is generally cheaper for us because of the conversion rates."

It was roasted chicken, rice with soya sauce, half a boiled egg, fresh slices of cucumber, and roasted peanuts.

The smart thing to do is stake your claim at one of the tables. Place your shopping bag, purse, umbrella or anything to hold that seat. Singapore is that safe, no one will take take/steal your stuff. Get on line and check out the menu before you order. My Yelper friend, Jessalyn P., (who came here two months before me) agree that it was our favorite meal while we were in Singapore. The shocking part, it was also the cheapest at $3.50 U.S. The portions are small. Kinda wished that we ordered more side meat dishes along with our meal. Get the veggies, it's simple yet one of the best I've ever had. I'm going to say that the biggest difference I taste in this chicken is the soy sauce they use. I think that's their secret. They pour it onto your rice too, so flavorful. The chicken itself is tender as can be, not one dry piece. I'm still dreaming about it. All of our eyes widen at first bite with a look of...OMG, it's so damn good.People will be hovering over you waiting for you to finish so they can take your seating. This is not a place to linger and chat. Be courteous, eat and leave.A must visit and worth waiting in line for."

You can opt in to wait in line with the cashier or order via the automated machine. The machine is is easy to use from what I saw so it's a good option if there happens to be a long line.Service: Super Quick, mostly self service. Longest part of our wait was to order. Tables turn over extremely quickly too because the busboys keep an eye on the tables well and take empty plates immediately then wipe down. Post ordering your receipt comes with a number and when your order is ready it pops up on a screen. Go back to the pick up area next to the cashier. Then lady there was nice and repeated my order to make sure it was correct and then took the number portion off my receipt. 5/5Ambiance: Loud, but much cooler and nicer then it would have been across the street if it was still in the Chinatown Complex.*Note: DO be prepared to split a table with someone. There is limited space and we all want to eat our food and go ^-^Eats:Roast Chicken Soya Noodle 5/5 Savory, tender, and moist. Probably one of the best versions I've had of this dish. Definitely good and well worth the price. The noodles are also well worth mentioning here. They are soft but still chewy! Delicious with just a bit of the ""BBQ chashu sauce"" that comes on the side.Roast Pork Rice 5/5 I actually enjoyed this much more then the chicken. As a kid I loved roast pork more then roast chicken simply out of laziness haha no bones versus bones! Haha so I do have good memories with this dish. However Hawker Chan's roast pork is different in that you can really taste the spices in a good way. It's extremely aromatic for something that is usually so simple.*Note: Hot sauce, soy sauce, and chilis are available directly to the left of the pick up station. This is also where you get your chopsticks and spoon.Overall would definitely return even with the price hikes given it's new location and fancy ordering system because it's still a destination and achieved something never done before."

It's clear that there's only one thing you really order there, and it's the soy sauce chicken. The real question is do you get a half chicken or 2 chicken with rice. We opted for the option that maximized this heralded bird. The order seems to be streamlined quite well and they called our number within 5 minutes of ordering. It was really good. Was it worthy of a michelin star....I don't know about that. Was it worth 7 bucks, **** yea it was. There was no piece that wasn't juicy, tender, and soft. If you're familiar with Costco chicken, think like 5 times more tender without any notion of strands of meat. I honestly have no idea how it's possible to be this perfect. Normally you have to fight for the red meat, but this chicken was just perfect everywhere. No discrimination! The soy sauce complemented it well and obviously went well with the chicken. It didn't seem fatty at all either, so seems like a dish I could eat every day of the week. If you start getting familiar with hawker costs, you realize this place is double the price of other chicken, is it twice as good, probably not. Would I go here vs other ones with limited time?

(Hello from Los Angeles!) Of course, I also have heard of this place because of the Michelin guide and it being the first hawker stall receiving a coveted star. I had to try it all - the soya chicken, the char siew, the roasted pork, and more. I had the soya chicken plate with the rice ($3.80 SGD) and the 3 way platter which comes with the char siew, roasted pork, and the pork rib ($10 SGD). It was amazing. You could really taste how different the soy sauce brew is, in comparison to other restaurants. The sauce is sweeter than most but with a very unique spice floral undertone. The char siew was amazing as well because of that unique soy sauce brew. The roasted pork is like any other in SG so you can totally skip this because I think they just have this, just to have people order it.This place is crowded on the weekends and getting a table inside is quite difficult so to avoid the chaos, the best thing to do is order your food as take out and bring it with you to the nearby Chinatown Food Street. Tons of outdoor seating during the lunch time and you can enjoy the meal without tons of people surrounding you as they queue or wait for you to leave and take your seat.This place wins for the price and their awesome product.

It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken. However, that probably is what made it even tastier.

Yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses. The food stall is located on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex, which is across the street from the air conditioned sit-down restaurant. The reason I chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is ""supposedly"" better. Also, if I'm going to come all the way here - it's better to eat at the original right? (Especially since Hawker Chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world). The soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a Michelin Star. At the stall it is S$2.50 (super cheap for a Michelin Star meal!) I also ordered a char siew rice which was also $2.50. There are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice, roasted pork rice, and the chicken hor fun. Most dishes are S$3 and under. Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well. I love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate. Was it amazing? I'm not sure. There are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious. I'm not sure what makes the chicken stand out. The char siew, however, was really good - I liked it more than the chicken.Overall, I think my expectations were too high because of this place's popularity and its star. The only reason we came here was to try the ""cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world"". I'm not sure if I would come here again and wait in the really long line. Comparing this place to other one Michelin Star restaurants I would give it a four star (good food at a very cheap price). Comparing this place to other Hawker stalls I would give it a five star."

Same thing goes with the roasted pork: there could have been more layering with the lean and fatty parts so the meat isn't too dry. You can't beat the price of $5 but honestly there are so many hawkers in Singapore that offer much cheaper and flavorful options.The seating/lining up situation was also very hectic given that there were a lot of people trying to find seats with trays of food in their hands in a very cramped space.

The meat is silky smooth and the skin has just the right amount of seasoning.It's amazing."

Their claim to fame is their soy sauce chicken, which I tried. The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful that paired well with plain white rice. I came on a Sunday morning around 11:30am, no line and easily found seating. I recommend using their electronic kiosk to order because that seems to be faster than ordering with the cashier. The kiosk accepts cash and credit cards, prints a receipt at the end to get your meal. I also ordered the bean sprouts, which I thought were too salty. The portions are plentiful for 2 people. Staff seems to work quickly to clear and clean tables. Overall, my experience was good, but I wasn't totally blown away."

A good indication that you've found it is: the longest line in the entire Hawker Center!You place your order, find a table, and enjoy your meal - or take yours to-go. There's a charge for to-go containers.If you want the full experience and you're not the whiny type, come here. Otherwise, go to the air conditioned version across the street and pay extra for the slight convenience.I've tried their soya chicken, char siew, roasted pork, rice, and noodles. My favorite was the roasted pork - it's everything that's good with Chinese roasted pork. De-li-cious! The noodles tend to get cold quick so you might want to take a quick pic of your food for Instagram and eat right away."

As soon as I saw a video on this place, I looked forward to the moment I would feast on this delicious meal. Lemme break it down for ya fam. You're going to wait in line during the busy and off hours. The line and turnover is very quick. Once you place your order, be sure to look for a place to sit during this time. The seats fill up fast, so look around to see which parties are almost done with their meal and ask them. Now to the main entree. This soya chicken is so juicy and flavorful in every bite. From the skin to the chicken meat, it was a delicious experience to throw down on. I recommend getting the half chicken instead of the regular size. The regular size just feels to little with the amount of chicken compared to the above average amount of rice they give. Besides, the half chicken won't break the bank either."

I ended getting a portion with a ton of bones, whereas my bf said his was boneless. The rice was cold and hard - blegh! Was disappointed with this dish.-Roast pork with noodle: I enjoyed this dish more than the soya chicken dish. The noodles were tasty and the pork skin had a nice crunch to it.

I was a little confused when my googling brought us to this location that was clearly not a little stall, but instead a newer location opened up after the success of the stall. We weren't sure if we should just eat here, or go find the original stall.A little research brought me the following information (I can't guarantee it is all true since I didn't actually go to the stall):+the food tastes pretty much the same at both places+the food is more expensive in this store+there is a much longer wait at the original stall (and no AC!)After weighing the cost/benefits (the big one being AC), we decided it wasn't worth it to try and find the original stall.So we got in line and ordered:+Soya Sauce Chicken Rice ($3.80): a simple dish, but the chicken was actually really delicious! The meat was tender and full of flavor. The soy sauce flavored rice was also simple, but a good addition.+Pork Rib Noodle ($5.00): the sauce was on the sweeter side, with the option of mixing in the spicy sauce (I didn't). The pork rib was probably my favorite of the pork meats we tried.+2 Combination Platter (Char Siew and Roasted Pork) ($6.00): I wasn't too impressed with the meats as they were both quite dry and not that flavorful.+Seasonal Vegetable ($5.00): pretty basic dish, but helps to keep the meat from being too overwhelming. Nothing amazing, but it was done well.+Roselle Tea ($2.00): this tastes a lot like suan mei tang (not sure of the English name). It is sweet and tart (similar to cranberries maybe?). Im personally not a huge fan.The food was good, and I left feeling satisfied without needing to break the wallet. That being said, is there probably better food out there? Very likely so, but at least you can have bragging rights about eating at a Michelin star restaurant! I would definitely recommend trying it at least once if you're in the Chinatown area."

Soya chicken from my hometown is so... dry that I would never order it, so my thought was how can chicken get better.. especially to the point that it deserves a star.If you want the full-on experience, you must go to the original hawker stand on the 2nd floor of the building across the street, but it usually has a longer line and opens later than the new chain restaurant opened on Smith Street. Also, if you are price conscious while on vacation, the stand is cheaper: - Soya Chicken DishAt Stand - $2.50At Franchise - $3.80- Half a ChickenAt Stand - $7At Franchise - $12We tried both places and think the food is pretty comparable. The franchise is more to make money from tourists for the investment firm that approached the chef (I believe the chef gets 30% of profits or 30% share of the business). You can get angry at the price difference, but you got to give the man props. Now, he'll actually make money for about the same amount of work. My group also tried several of the Soya chicken stands in the area, and they do not compare. For me, its all in the texture and flavor. The chicken is tender while succulent and reminds me of roast duck, but with the heavy flavor of soy sauce. Delicious!I'd definitely recommend the trying either location.

This is the first restaurant of recently rewarded Chef Chan who is a Michelin starred chef! His hawker stand which is rated ""cheapest Michelin starred food in the world"" is not far front this restaurant. See Yelp link here:yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-s… We chose to try this restaurant as it just opened Nov 2016, and I've got to say that the soy sauce chicken is superb. It is nice that it is air conditioned as well. We got there and the queue was not that long outside but when we left it snaked around and was on the street out of the queue barriers. There is a queue outside the door, and they let you in in bunches so you don't overwhelm the kitchen and ordering. You either order at the counter register or get helped by someone at the ordering machine as well. Both seems effective and decently orderly. You order, pay, get a number, then, grab your seat. Your number gets called and you pick up your order. Utensils, hot sauce, straws, chilis, are self service too. The neat thing is Chef Chan was there putting out the food from the kitchen too. There is a variety of menu combinations or alacarte you can choose from but basically soy sauce chicken, char siew (BBQ pork), roast pork, roast pork ribs. Then there is rice, wonton noodles, hor fun (wide flat rice noodles).  Then veggies and drinks. We ordered a full chicken (S$23), 2 combination meat of char siew and roast pork (S$6), rice (.8) and wonton noodles (1.5), and two drinks. We basically had leftover chicken and a few pieces of the others but we knew that'd happen. Overall, as expected, soy sauce chicken their specialty, was by far the best. One of the best soy sauce chickens I've ever had. Weakest was the roast pork in my opinion but still good. Because of the air conditioning, the wonton noodles (which are served dry with the soy sauce chicken sauceon it) didn't stay as warm as I'd like but still was good. The rice with the sauce was good with the chicken too. I'd recommend stopping by and queuing for this whether it be the restaurant or hawker if you're in Singapore. Given that it's S$3.80 (around $2.50 usd) It is super affordable and yummy. FYI/ hawker stall info is in the link above and very near the restaurant is: Hawker Stall: Blk 335, Smith Street #02-126, Chinatown Food Complex, Singapore 050335Opening Hours: 10:30am to 7:00pm (Mon - Tues, Thurs - Fri), 8:30am to 7:00pm (Sat - Sun), Closed WedTip/ cash, credit, nets which is great for versatility of payment Tip2/ must try the soy sauce chicken Tip3/ very near the Chinatown MRT (purple North-east line) I believe exit A toward smith street is the proper exit."

The hot sauce is also quite sweet and not really worth using.Roast pork was cut into nice small pieces and had a fairly good ratio of lean meat, to juicy meat, to crackling did lack a bit of crispness- it was a bit more of a stale crunch, but still decent.The sauce on the chicken isn't just regular soy but you can taste the seasonings from the braising process which is nice.The tea has too much sugar and not enough flower- would not recommend.Service/Experience:Staff is woefully unprepared which is why everything is so slow. The kitchen is actually very fast and all the food is ready to go but the actual point of sale system seems to be flawed and this is why the wait is so damn long. One cashier started taking my order but was abruptly stopped by someone else. One of the cashiers doubles to clean the dining room and let in the next batch of customers. I recommend coming back in a few months when hopefully the service improves."

Lo and behold, the sign stated ""Liao Fan- Hawker Chan,"" world's cheapest Michelin star restaurant! Hawker Chan had partnered and expanded his business and created a dine-in restaurant near his original store.Though the queue (two rows) looked intimidating, we decided to wait it out and see what the hype was about. SERVICE:+ Though interaction with the staff is minimal, I found the process self-explanatory and efficient. While waiting in-line, the staff brought us menus so we would know what we wanted to order by the time we got to the cashier. After you place your order and pay, they will give you a buzzer that will vibrate when your food is ready. Then you trade your buzzer for the food that you pick up. +To keep the flow going and meet the demand, the staff were efficient in cleaning-up. They immediately seized the table to clean-up as soon as the party leaves the table.   FOOD:+ Simple menu options + VALUE MEAL -- it really lives up to the ""world's cheapest Michelin star restaurant."" The soya chicken rice was only $3.80! The portion of one meal left me feeling just content. I would recommend ordering side dishes if you want fully satisfy your hunger. + They were out of Char Siew when we ordered around 6:30pm, so we ordered the soya chicken rice and noodle. Both were delicious, though I wished there were more greens in the meal. Atmosphere:+ This is an ""up-scale"" version of an Hawker center: clean and not as noisy as Hawker Centers,Overall, I'm glad that we ran into Liao Fan and tried it out!"

But I really appreciate some of the most down-to-earth restaurants that have gotten a Michelin star. For example, I gladly went to one in Hong-Kong. And in Singapore this Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle spot is sorely unassuming, but it must be doing something right to receive that star. The reviews are so mixed, it bewildered me. There are a lot of folks who like it and many who do not and call it overhyped. I ordered, I felt like, the signature dish on the menu. Yes, surely the classic soy sauce chicken. That's their claim to fame dish and they would sell this dish at their first stall for 2 SG dollar a plate. Later they raised the price to SG$3.80, but the extra cost goes into the overhead like the air conditioning, nice seating, etc. So essentially it's still a SG$2 Michelin star meal. The chicken looked beautiful, the colour looked  right, there was a bunch of sauce in the rice itself along with some soy beans. The rice was fluffy and tasty, the sauce's taste was uniquely sweet and much deeper than just mere soy sauce. As for the chicken, it's highly tender white meat, neither dry nor juicy.

I understand that's part of certain chicken rice recipes, but not as enjoyable for me when I'm constantly picking bones out of my mouth while trying to eat. More importantly than the bones, though, is the fact that the chicken was literally cold when I got my plate. I don't know if this is part of their recipe, but I thought it was kind of gross to eat. Chicken rice should be HOT.

The key to this place is to get here early, as I showed up 45 min before it even opened and there was already 15 people in line. The food is good and well worth the visit, I ordered the chicken and rice plate as that was their most notable dish.

I realize the Michelin star was awarded to the original location in the actual hawker center, however the adding of locations must have have a negative effect. Honestly, it was easily the worst food we've had in 3 days in Singapore. The chicken was not very tasty, yet it was juicy. Perhaps because to us, it seemed undercooked.

'16.  I went to the original store around 1;30pm on a weekday.  It was closed and was directed by a sign to their new location which started less than a month ago during the end of Nov.  Many people like me were caught on a surprise,  Anyway, it was a short stroll from the hawker center to the new location, basically across Smith Street of Chinatown Complex where the hawker center is.  Wow....  the line was long, spend more than an hour to get in just to order.  And as you can see why a 3 stars?  Here's the summary....Service - The staffs were very unpleasant, somehow they were all burned out(This new store was opened less than a month ago when I came) or they were way under paid.  From the staff for maintaining the line to enter the restaurant(Just to enter the restaurant for standing in line to order).  The staff that guild you ordering via a kiosk and he will not let you touch it.  I tried to order myself as he was sllloooowwwwwww, his mind is like 20% working and the 80% thinking about something else, not work related I'm sure.  It's just a koisk, I know how to press on the things I want, there's picture too but he gives me the look.  Fine, after order and received a pager, attempt to locate a table while waiting for my food to be picked up.  As I was waiting, I saw the staffs were slow at cleaning the table, they were upset at people who removed used plates and placed on unoccupied tables.  People were cleaning tables themselves as they were waiting for the food.  When the pager rang, time to pick up my food and asked the staff for condiments as it was almost empty.  The ladies just replied 'Ok' and ignored me, I waited for more than 5 mins before someone came to fill.  I believe the other popular Chicken Rice store in Maxwell Food Center did a better job organizing.Food - The Soya Chicken was good but not to the extend for waiting for more than an hour or to die for.  I do like the taste but it's a little too sweet for me.  I don't mind the saltiness.  The chicken mixed well with either rice or noodle.  That's the only reason for a 3 starsPrice - Way to high.  I am not comparing this with a hawker food center prices but a typical food court in a mall.  For the portion provided with respect to price.  It's consider very expensive.  Generally, a plate of chicken rice/noddle comes with about a quarter of a chicken.  Therefore a chicken can serve 4 plates of chicken rice/noodle but for them, for a chicken they serve 8 plates of chicken rice/noodle.  You can imagine how little chicken you get.  For 2-3 person, I will suggest half a chicken to share and not chicken rice/noodle plate.  You will laugh at the portion for one person.Conclusion - Way overrated.  If you do visit Singapore, and you have not come here before, I will say do visit this restaurant but do plan according.  Standing in line for more than an hour is really waste of time.  Or to die for.  Do not expect service.  I believe hawker center do better than them."

To be fair, this could be my fault. I ordered the 3 BBQ Combo item. This included BBQ pork, Roasted Pork Belly and BBQ Ribs. Maybe I don't quite understand what Michelin means, especially for a ""hawker"". It's only after I sat down and looked at the screen and realize that they are known for their Soy Sauce Chicken. I thought Michelin stars for for the restaurant as a whole, not just one dish, but I could be wrong. Maybe the Soy Sauce Chicken is worth a try. However, I can say for an absolute fact that the 3 BBQ Combo I got was just pure trash. BBQ pork was not marbled in anyway and was completely dried and lacking in sauce. Roasted Pork Belly had barely any fat between the skin and meat. On top of that the Skin was dry and damp instead of having that oily, crisp crunch. Ribs were dry as well and also lacking sauce. As someone from the SGV area of SoCal, even he most average Chinese restaurant tops this place.Service (5): The line to order wasn't too bad and moved quickly. For some odd reason people were lining up to order with the cashier. But there was a order machine right next to them. I skipped the lines and made a quick easy order using that. I really enjoyed that and am a sucker for innovation so I am giving it a 5 because of that.Ambiance (3): You will notice I put hawker in quotes on the food section. This is because it's not really a hawker. It's a restaurant. Maybe at one point it was a hawker stall at the hawker centers, but not anymore. It's just a regular restaurant. Nothing special about it. It's pretty bland, but at least it's clean.Price (4): Decent and cheap price. However, this is an American's point of view and food is generally cheaper for us because of the conversion rates."

All other dishes/sides are alright but nothing special about them. You can find equivalent quality for these other dishes/sides elsewhere.I have tried here twice and enjoy having the noodles with soya sauce chicken. The rice seems quite popular here and so is the Hor Fun except that Hor Fun noodles do not arrive early. My colleague ordered it at 12nn but was told the noodles were not in yet.Waiting in this restaurant is quite comfortable.First you queue up to place an order. As you get nearer the counter, you will eventually have a choice of ordering via a vending machine or continue in the line to the counter staff. People tend to take quite some time at the vending machine so I take that to mean it's not user friendly enough. This ordering queue takes about 15-20 mins, based on the before 12nn crowds.After placing your order and paying up, you will be given a receipt with a queue number. Now you can go to your seat and look out for the TV monitors that show the queue number for food collection.So far, diners there will just eat and go and not much lingering around so you should be able to get a table fairly quickly.I will go back again - just for the chicken."

My team and I were pleased with the variety of breads in the basket and the gluten free options for those who needed it.I ordered the braised beef. The flavors were great but I was surprised at how this was basically served in a bowl so the mashed potatoes and glazed carrots were swimming in the sauce. It made the vegetable over cooked and the potatoes too loose. I am not big on a ton of sauce normally so this was just not the right options for me.The wait staff was very kind and overall if you have the time for a full multi-course meal, it's worth the try. Just make sure to ask questions about the dishes so you know exactly what you're getting."

I have bookmarked Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen since last year but never get a chance to try it.Guess today was the day when I should go check it out. I had been to a Gordon Ramsay's Michelin-starred restaurant decade ago. It was a great memorable dining experience for me. Bread Street Kitchen was located at L1 at The Shoppes at Marina May Sands. I read somewhere it was supposed to be a casual restaurant but I do not recommend wearing shorts and flip flops here. There was only one thing I wanted to try for my first visit to Bread Street Kitchen. That would be the Classic Fish & Chips. FOODClassic Fish & Chips with crushed peas & tartar sauce - 4/5 ~ The portion was generous. The type of fish used here was lingcod. I guess I like my fish to be of Atlantic Cod. Anyhow, the batter was perfect. Love the chips, they were thicker than the normal American fries. The crushed peas was nasty.   Sorry, it looked like those pea purée for babies and I must say this must be one of those acquired taste kind of thing :PIced Lemon Tea - 5/5 ~ different in a very good way. Not too sweet and 100% refreshing!!AMBIENCE - 5/5I like the décor, music a tad loud for me. SERVICE -5/5Karen was very friendly and attentive. After the food was served, she came back and checked how I like the food. When I was done with the food (no, I couldn't finish all my food), she cleared the plate and cleaned up any crumbs on the table. Shortly after I asked for the check, she came back with an iPad and asked if I would be kind to give a survey of the dining experience today. How could I say no when someone asked so nicely? :D She also left a jar of chocolate chip cookies with a tong. I took one out to try, it was very good! Crisp and not too sugary sweet. I was planning to give an overall 4 star for my review but Karen was so outstanding (hard to get such service these days) and so I am happy to award a 5 stars to Bread Street Kitchen. I hope Gordon Ramsay will give her a raise or promotion, lol!"

Alas, I also know that celebrity chef restaurants mean celebrity chef prices and that's what has dampened my enthusiasm somewhat. Still Bread Street Kitchen was decent, if not mind-blowing.We arrived at 1130am for brunch and were seated almost immediately, the restaurant was relatively full for pre-lunch hour and many people were celebrating birthdays. I guess it is a pretty nice place for a celebration.We shared the scallops as a starter - they were good though unremarkable and unfortunately very salty.For my main, I ordered the corn fritters. They arrived and looked quite beautiful except that they were definitely not fritters and more like pancakes. Still delicious with the sour cream, guac and sauteed peppers but I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to some crisp fritters for lunch. I'd have been happier if they just changed the name to manage expectations.Someone at my table ordered the signature fish and chips - it was pretty well done and was a huge piece of fish! It was nicely fried, well battered and very fresh. I liked their little jars of ketchup and tartar sauce too.The highlight of the meal however, was the free jar of cookies that came with the check! Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies - fresh and crisp and not too sweet. I had to close the jar to stop myself from finishing them all."

Love them, or hate them. We, in Singapore are always very fortunate to have world renowned chefs opening their establishments here giving us an opportunity to try their creation in our home soil rather than flying halfway across the globe. From Wolfgang Puck to Tetsuya Wakuda to Joel Robouchon - we have it all here. And just recently Gordon Ramsay, the no-nonsense chef we love watching on TV opened his first restaurant in MBS and got everyone excited. I called two days ago and was told the restaurant is fully booked everyday until July 28th. Two days ago was July 1st. Not giving up, my friend and I walked in at 6pm yesterday with ""puss-in-boots"" lost and hungry expression while pushing our luck with the hostess in charge. Turns out she has a table and the reservation is only by 730pm. She asked if we can finish by then and we happily said FOR SHUREEEE! We have the best table for the night, on the lower floor, quieter and right next to the open kitchen. Upon seated, we were presented with a basket of various home-made bread served with a slab of salted butter. We then proceed to order one item from each category - from cold starter, to hot starter to mains. First off - Alaskan king crab and apple cocktail with pink peppercorn. Delicious. Succulent and plump pieces of Alaskan king crab tossed with thin apple slices in light dressing. A refreshing start to a great meal. Next up, we have English green asparagus with parma ham, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. The parma ham could be more generous in my opinion since they charge $20 for 4 stalks of pathetic looking asparagus. Taste wise, it was pretty good with a combination of different textures from the asparagus, the smoothness of the poached egg and hollandaise sauce. For salad, we ordered warm bang bang chicken salad with watercress mouli, chili, beansprout, radish, ginger and peanuts. So good! Nothing beats a warm salad with pieces of chicken that pack a punch. The chili woke up the taste buds (and sweat glands too) and I did break a sweat or two while polishing the dish clean. All the mains sound good from the menu and we were torn between BSK short rib burger or the slow roasted pork belly, but alas, our host won us over by suggesting the traditional fish and chips with crushed peas and tartar sauce - a British classic and an all-time favorite. The fish and chips is decent and live up to expectations. Lightly battered while maintaining the freshness of the fish after deep frying. I wish they serve 2 pieces of fillet instead of one though. What impress me most is the mustard and ketchup in a jar so cute you want to steal it home (but please don't, stay classy!) from Wilkin & Sons Ltd. So very Bri-ish Stamford Raffles would be so proud. Overall, it was an enjoyable evening - food is great and service is commendable. Maybe it's still early and the restaurant wasn't that pack so we get all the attention. It was my first experience eating at Ramsay's restaurant and I came with no expectation. And usually when you have the least expectations, it will surpass and impress. Some of you might argue you have better experience from his restaurants elsewhere, but for me, the restaurant deserves a 3.72957 stars, round up to 4. Definitely coming back in the next couple of months and see how it matures.  p/s: 3 appetizers, 1 main, 1 glass of house red + 1  beer = $136 without tax."

Decided to try Gordon Ramsey's food and recipes to see how they turnout. Started with two appetizers, the tamarind spiced chicken wings and the tuna tartar with crispy wantons. First the wings. They were probably the worst wings I have ever encountered. It had a hard breaded shell with an overly sweet (no hint of the tamarind) sauce. The colder the wings got the tougher they became. Second the tuna tartar. The tuna was almost flavorless except for some sesame oil which is fairly mild. The crispy wonton skins made up for the dish.For the entree, my dining partner and I decided to try the roasted pork belly with an apple chutney/roulade. The pork had the skin left on and it was roasted into a hard crust. Furthermore the crust was quite heavily salted that it made it difficult to. It sat in a soy sauce based sauce which made it saltier and difficult to cut into even with a steak knife. The saving grace was the pork itself was cooked perfectly and was not too fatty as pork belly can tend to be. The apple chutney was excellent and went well with the pork meat.Service was very good and the servers were more than attentive. The bread bowl came out quickly and so did our waters. Even though the bottle of water sat onour table. The servers would refill our glasses periodically.The bottom line is that I am not sure if I will make an effort to visit here again."

The mango ice cream is crave-able and we really had a good time. It wasn't to pricey but some things were kind of high. The only knock was the hostess although very friendly wouldn't seat us in the premium area even though the place was not full. Kind of felt like we didn't make the cut and had to sit at the end outside. No bad seating and people watching was cool but I rather would have sat inside. Recommend trying it as it was really good food.

And since she talked about Chef Gordon Ramsay, I decided to bring her here to give it a try.While entering the open concept restaurant, we were greeted by a female staff and she asked us whether we had any reservation. As we did not have one, we were asked whether we mind bar seats. Without much hesitation, we said we do not mind. We were led to our high chair seatings (facing each other). I decided to sit facing the waters. Took a quick look at the menu and ordered the following.1) Fish & Chips - The beer battered fish fillet was great. It was slightly fried giving the top part a crispy touch to it. The thick cut fries was disappointing though as it has not much taste to it. I had to ask the waiter whether there is mashed potato gravy and he ended up getting me their special brown sauce (a few ingredients mixed and similar to bbq sauce but it had a tangy taste). The crushed peas was interesting and the tartar sauce was great if eaten with the fish fillet. Unfortunately this dish did not live up to my expectations especially after staying in Sydney for 4 months.2) Onion rings - 6 rings inside a bowl. The flour overpowered the taste of the onions. It was crunchy but would prefer to be served warmer. This appetizer is really filling and even without condiments, it is salty. 3) Pineapple Carpaccio, passionfruit and coconut sorbet - I ordered this as it has all my favorite tropical fruits in a dish. When the dish arrived, I was wow-ed by the looks. The grated coconut flakes and the thinly sliced pineapples were pretty attractive on a white serving plate. The coconut sorbet was also perfectly scooped. This dish did impressed me. The thinly sliced pineapple that looks like flower petals were sweet. And with the addition of scattered passionfruit with seeds it made the dish to be both sweet and sour. And the coconut flakes added the crunch to the dish. The coconut sorbet was not too sweet either. Definitely love this plate of dessert.4) Rhythm & Blues (mocktail/ non-alcoholic) - somehow the ingredients inside this beverage made me order this beverage. It came in a martini glass. The mocktail was fruity and refreshing. And there was a mint leaf on top of it too to add flavor to the drink. At the top of the beverage, there was a foamy layer and the bartender added salt and pepper. You could taste the interesting spun for this drink towards the end and yes, it was addictive. This drink has less ice too so it was not diluted.5) Forbidden forest (mocktail/ non-alcoholic) - this drink came in a tall glass with a small base. It came with a straw and you could see the crushed ice too. On top of the drink, there was a raspberry and a small touch of rosemary. Unfortunately this drink was a little diluted (too much ice) and you could probably finish it in countable sips. Before the dishes and the beverages arrive, we were given freshly baked homemade breads. The breads were alright but the butter that accompanied the bread was addictive. It melts inside the mouth and was not as salty as I had expected. Service here was pretty efficient. Once you raise your hand up in the air, a waiter or waitress will head to you quickly. I would prefer my dishes to be warmer and the price to be lower. Good experience dining in a restaurant opened by a celebrity chef."

Its easy to sell the concept especially in a very brand conscious city like Singapore. Furthermore, it location - Marina Bay Sands - thrives on this concept. You name the luxury brand, we have it there. A fan of GR himself, I may prove to be a tad bias on this review. In addition, i must add that I went with my mom and her group of friends. So, in essence, my experience wasn't the most refined but relatable to the heartlander.At least the wait staff was patient enough to handle the aunty-ness in my mom and her friends. Allowing them to randomly call out items from the menu and turning a blind eye to the concept of them sharing everything they ordered. They were also proactive to offer suggestions on what to order based on the clientele of the table, which I appreciated.For starters, the corn soup was amazing. The texture and the protein was well done. Creamy and flavourful. A very good way to start the meal. Their asian flavoured wings (9 pieces in all) were well marinated and had a tang to it. My mom's friends call it the atas har cheong kai (upscale spiced chicken wing) and enjoyed relishing its taste with their fingers while I quietly attempt not to cringe.For the mains, they ordered the smoked salmon and the sunday special, Sunday Roast. While I had the rib eye which was not exactly done as per ordered - medium rare - but overall the flavour was there. The bernaise sauce that accompanied the steak was good. Overall, all the mains we ordered met expectations and the portions just right.As for dessert, i was floored with their chocolate cake with mint ice cream. My two favourite flavours in the entire world. It was as if this dessert was made just for me. The center was oozing with chocolatey goodness and the mint ice cream was just smooth and not too sweet. Oh and the aunties ordered a berry pie, which was okay. Tartness was there but compared to me cake... Let's just say it wasnt the best. Haha.I would come back here again to get a taste of their other dishes. Although i must admit with a table of 5 we covered about 25% of the items off the menu. The aunties love it and they will be back with more aunty-ness with their family and othee aunty friends. So I guess GR can't go very wrong with this joint. Maybe next time I'll come with a more sophisticated crowd to see how its like on the other side of the grass patch. Till then, enjoy BSK!"

All I can say is...... Finally!!After months and months of debating if I should give Bread Street Kitchen a shot, we decided to make our way down to finally give it a try. I have to admit, I'm a huge.... HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsey's, so I was caught on the fence about the initial reviews. Having eaten at Gordon Ramsey at the London in Manhattan (now closed) and his flag ship restaurant Gordon Ramsey at Hospital Road, in London, the expectations were pretty high. Yes, it's a casual take on Gordon Ramsey and yes it's comfort food but..... It's still a Gordon Ramsey group of restaurants. So while a part of me said YES I have to eat here, the other half told me ""but what if it's a let down like initial reviews suggested?"".Initial Service. Was a little disappointed. Considering how you get immediate attention and service and his other restaurant, this one was a little slower. No hostess at the reception counter, wait staff and managers glancing over with no one really saying anything u till the hostess arrived a minute or so later. However, hostess was polite enough to explain that the restaurant was fully reserved and that we had to return our table in an hour. No harm darn considering a) this wasn't a fine dining 3 hour long lunch experience b) we had to get back to the museum for some workshops anyway.The Menu Nothing overly elaborate. 3 page menu filled with comfort food ranging from a Brunch items like Eggs Benedict to Salads, hot mains and Grilled items like Roasted Chicken and Angus steaks. The Price I have to admit, a little of the steep side. Having lunched at his other 2 restaurants, which offered 3 course lunch specials for £35 and USD45, a S$38 Shepherd's pie is a bit pricey. However, considering that this IS Marina Bay Sands where you pay $10 for chicken rice and $27 for a Margherita pizza. We decided to go with the basics. After all, isn't the simplest food the hardest to prepare?Bread Basket The break selection is fantastic! And the butter? To die for! My only wish was that the bread was a little warmer but the variety given was fantastic and tasted great. Couldn't have asked for more. Scallops Off the bat, perfectly cooked scallops. Having had below par scallops recently, this certainly helped the Gf put into perspective what beautifully cooked scallops should taste like. The carrot purée though, I thought, was a little light. While smooth and still a bit sweet, it didn't quite shine like a carrot purée should, with the purée offering more texture than it does flavour. The apple and bacon combination was delightful though, offering enough saltiness, with the richness cut by the apples. However, while the sweetness of the scallops was this there, eating it without the purée and apples made it a bit on the salty side. Overall, still a good dish and nothing is more comforting that the holy trinity of Scallop, Bacon and Apples. Fish & Chips Now THIS is what I call fish and chips. Unfortunately, a lot of the fish and chips in Singapore, though claiming to be authentic British fish and chips, some how still feels a bit of a let down.From the first cut, you would know that this is a good Fish and Chips. The batter was thin and crispy and a first cut in reveals a very juicy, perfectly cooked piece of cod. Juicy, succulent. Although not as large as Smith's, the difference in quality is undeniable. The fish was fresh, not frozen and it was beautifully seasoned. And the chips. The chips are so so so good! By far one of the best fish and chips I've had in Singapore. Millionaires Shortbread with Hazel-Nut milk Sorbet. Chocolate lovers rejoice! This is definitely an ultimate chocolate lover's delight! Rich and smooth chocolate on top with a brownie like base, this is what I call A DESSERT!The hazel-nut milk sorbet was more ice cream than sorbet and was rather sweet but it's creaminess did add to the smoothness of an already rich chocolate ""cake"".   Overall impression. While the food was good, service was average. While staff were friendly, it did feel like they were a bit stretched, with the chef calling service please 3-4 times before dessert was picked up and the bill taking a fair bit to reach us. Will we be back? Definitely. If they could make fish and chips that good, I can't wait to try the rest of their dishes. However, because of the price, I can see why people are put off. Blame it on rental or the fact that he's a celebrity chef in MBS but the restaurant would have gotten a solid 5 had it not been for the slow service and price."

Ultimately she's giving excuses vs offering solutions and came off non-responsive so we had to take initiative to make sure we get our seats. As though walking in without a reservation is unwelcomed. The host came off uppity but our waiter was efficient and friendly.Other negative was ""no more"" Beef Wellington. Wtfbbq! :\Food was just ok to great.Scallops- Great. Well cooked. Wish there was more than 3 though.Shepherds Pie- Deceivingly small. Lamb pieces were chunky but tender. Pretty ok dish.Black Cod- Simply delicious.Fish Cake- Skip. Picture looked tastier than it is. Much too dry.Beef Burger- Burger was normal. Nothing amazing. What's amazing is the ketchup for the fries. Surprisingly good.Overall make a reservation if you're a GR fan or curious, because if you had to wait, skip this place. Better joints around."

We went in on a Saturday morning, expecting to have a wonderful brunch. We left feeling grossly full and severely unsatisfied. First the bread basket. Perhaps stale is too strong a word, but most of the bread was exactly that. Dry, tasteless and hard. The butter was overly salted. I adjusted my expectations and hoped for a less disappointing rest of the meal. We all ordered the Eggs Benedict to play it safe - there's no way they'd get this wrong. Eggs: overly poached. Rubbery consistency. Ham: so so so salty. I needed a few glasses of water to wash this down. Hollandaise: Thick. Extremely salty. And thick.I felt like I was eating a tub of butter with old bread and a sad egg substitute. I didn't have it in me to order anything else- I wanted to leave as soon as I could.

The food is just nothing special. Went for the recommended fish and chips which I hoped would be crispy batter with tasty fish inside. Rather it was a soggy batter that tasted like any other fish and chips I've ever had except this felt much more full of oil. Tartare sauce and fries were nothing special. Not to mention we waited a very long time for this to come out.We also went for the tuna tartare which had a fishy taste to it surprisingly.

Prior reviews got this one spot on; this was a gem.Main Course: Fish and Chips + BSK Short Rib burger (my friend's)My fish and chips was meh. The fish was of a great quality, but it was very under-seasoned. Mediocre. However, my friend remarked his burger as delicious, tender and juicy.Dessert: Monkey Shoulder CheesecakeMediocre. Ended the night with a flat note.Although my visit was alright, consistency seems to be an issue here. For example, my friend visited this restaurant again a few months after, and his friend's rib burger tasted like rubber.

They don't even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they ARE.Now one of two main reasons for visiting Chinatown Complex (the other being the Good Beer Company) and having their XLB on several occasions after Cindy Q. introduced it to our little gathering, I can safely say that $5 for 10 XLBs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers...is ""Woohoo!

Everything is clearly handmade fresh here though; you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen, making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets. Of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as DTF, but if you're looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you.We also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup, one plate of pan-fried dumpling, one plate of boiled dumplings, and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton. For a group of six, the total was just S$7pp! The beef noodle soup was very delicious, and I'd definitely order that on its own again. The pan-fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well. The pan-fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook (also more unhealthy). The szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar."

I'm a huge xlb fan - used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat AND the free flow xlb! & I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung. My conclusion: this is comparable with DTF quality xlb in Singapore, for a better price point. The skin is paper-thin without being overly soft or breakable, and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot. We thought that the filling is more generous than DTF or other places in general (and the dumpling are similar sized), and similar-tasting. The dumplings are also made-to-order, which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam (or pan fry if you order guo tie) but so very worth it. Obviously it's in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of, but it's great for a no-frills meal.

Many reviewers have compared this place's dumpling to DTF - an unfair comparison given that DTF is a huge global franchise. In my opinion, this place is way better than DTF. I would not hesitate to come back again and again."

After all, the endless banter causes your brain to think they are PERFECT because of how they are marketed right?This probably explains my utter distaste towards Din Tai Feng (especially the two overcrowded spots in LA that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area). Don't get me wrong, they are decent. Quite good at best...but nothing mind-blowing. So when people keep saying that Din Tai Feng is the ONLY to-go spot for GOOD dumplings...bile begins to form in my mouth.Fast-forward to Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao...you'll find two very friendly and hardworking PRCs (wanted to say Chinese guys but changed it PRC to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking AWESOME; they should be culinary ambassadors) kneading dough and forming Xiao Long Baos (hereafter, XLBs) one after the other with their magical fingers. They don't even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they ARE.Now one of two main reasons for visiting Chinatown Complex (the other being the Good Beer Company) and having their XLB on several occasions after Cindy Q. introduced it to our little gathering, I can safely say that $5 for 10 XLBs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers...is ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""/Definitely-recommendNOTE: I've had it 5 times so far (20-30 each time) and the best time is usually dinner after a long line. Why? I went at lunch and my 20 XLBs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones I've had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made.Yelp 100: 36/100"

It's totally underrated, and flies so low under the radar, that it was 3 years before I learned of its illustrious lineage: Ola's head chef was the executive chef of the short-lived celebrity restaurant Santi at MBS.Dinner-time will find the restaurant a lot more chilled and tranquil, compared to the frenzied boisterousness of the lunchtime crowd. I much prefer dinners here; there's a languorous ambience perfect for savouring OLA's exquisite tapas. Service is also a lot more intimate and attentive. We had:1) 36-months aged Jamon Iberico '5J' ($48): sublime fatty salty ribbons of cured pork shoulder sided by catalan toasts and fresh tomato puree. Pricey, but sublime nonetheless.2) Burrata with Pesto ($35) with heirloom tomatoes, edamame, and crispy jamon curls: an off-menu special that was a fantastic recommendation by the affable manager. Incredibly balanced in terms of flavour and texture, this is a must-try if ever it's in season.3) Gambas ($25) - of fresh sweet prawns swimming in a medley of roasted garlic oil, dried chilli, and espelette pepper: heady and aromatic. Dish with the complimentary crusty bread, great fodder for the robustly flavoured oil.4) Pulpo ($26): Spanish octopus grilled to a luscious and smoky finish, and complemented by a nutty lentil sauce, and lightly spiced romesco vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of octopus (the tentacles scare me), but even I was blown away by this.5) Conchas a la Parmesana ($35): a duo of plump Hokkaido scallops baked to a succulent caramelization, was set atop parmesan grains, and a creamy lime and brandy aioli. Decent, but not outstanding.6) Fiduea con Secreto Iberico y Setas ($45): loved the flavourful noodle paella dish loaded with organic oyster mushrooms and grilled iberico pork, even if my galfriend found its sweet undertones disconcerting.7) Ceviche ($25): only lackluster dish where the potent taste of the wild seabass overwhelmed the delicate flavours of the lime, chilli, and onion marinade"

That's kinda the case with Ola. The gazpacho here is worth 5 stars. No doubt about it, hands down the best I've had in Singapore. I almost wanted to order one for dessert, it was that good. Coupled with the rustic, crusty bread they serve? Heavenly.Everything else though? Good but unspectacular. For tapas, we had the grilled octopus, the calamari, and the croquettas. I enjoyed all three, to be fair, but the grilled octopus, while tasty, wasn't quite there in terms of texture, and didn't quite match up to my standard for grilled octopus here in Singapore. The calamari was... interesting, I enjoyed the sauces, it was fresh, well cooked, but not... mind-blowing, if you know I mean. It was good, but not memorable. Croquettas. I love croquettas, and the ones here are definitely worth ordering... but not worth going to the restaurant for. Crisp, creamy, generously sized, personally (and this really is a personal thing) I think it could have used a little bit more potato to offset the creaminess. Some people like creamy though, so don't let me discourage you from trooping down to give it a try.For mains we ordered the seafood stew and the paella. The paella... was average. I preferred BOMBA's, and we didn't even finish it because it wasn't really attention grabbing in terms of flavour or texture. The seafood stew was fresh, and a very generous portion, but the broth was a little thin for it to be a 4 or 5 star dish.The Sangria however, was EXCELLENT. If you're a fan of sangria that's fruity, light, and refreshing, then you'll love Ola's. So... yeah. I'm admittedly a little picky and don't hand out 4 or 5 star ratings that easily, but Ola was a pleasant meal, and they're worth visiting (or even revisiting). But I wouldn't say ""I'm a fan""."

Also had the pork kidney and stomach soup  as well.  Both just as good.  Broth is more peppery for the stomach soup.  In case those who are allergic or don't like pepper.

The rib meat, which has soaked in the richness of the broth, fell off the bone effortlessly and was melt-in-your-mouth tender.After you finish your ribs when there is more room in the bowl, you can ask for a refill of the soup.  They will happily do that.  In fact I saw some people ask for two or more refills.While they probably won't tell you their secret recipe, they do sell boxes of pre-mixed packets of the spices at the cashier's counter.  Yours truly actually bought a box of 10 packets, each of which is good for 4 - 6 servings.  I am actually making the soup right now.  I'll let you know how it goes when I see you next time."

The total bill came out to be around 17 SGD.The main event was amazing. I loved the white pepper flavour of the broth, and it warmed me up to my tippy-toes (good thing they have AC!). I did expect a bit more pork flavour, but it was really good nonetheless. By the way, did I mention the broth is bottomless? The server came by at least 3-4 times to ask if I wanted a refill. It was so good it was hard to refuse, but at the end I was just too stuffed to have anymore.The lemon barley tea was fantastic also, and hit the spot to alternate between the hot broth and the cold drink.

The outside one tends to be shorter but has no A/C, so take your pick.The prices here are also quite reasonable. The standard pork rips soup is S$7.30 for regular or S$9.50 for the large.

For a table of 7 we started off with prawns (delicious sauce and would recommend) and grilled octopus (soft, flavorful...highly recommend). For mains we had a mix of well seasoned Bombay potatoes (garam masala, mustard, cumin...yummy) with their grilled spring chicken for 3 (just okay), smoked black cods that came in two circle shaped filets with the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms on the opposite side of the plate (fish was a cooked a bit on the oily side but still presentable and edible), sea bass  in a fish broth and Thai basil  for two  (one finished it all and the other ate half).  Special dessert was in a bed of ice and shot glasses filled with watermelon fruit on the bottom and raspberry sorbet on top. Instagram worthy. Service at the table was great. Service prior to seating was not so great because the host was trying to give us a table inside when we had requested outside we'll in advance. They tried to say that those were reserved but yet we saw no one sitting there. And then the manager was trying to tell us that of it rains that we have no table. He wasn't happy about giving us the table outside when we pressed him on giving us the outside table. Through out the evening it didn't even rain once. So many patrons came to eat and there were tables left empty where we sat. Poor execution on the management's seating arrangement."

Came here for cocktails but ended eating too. It came as a surprise we were able to get a table of 5 without reservation on a Saturday evening. Obviously prices were on the high side considering portion sizes. Here is a quick run down of the dishes I liked - Xinjiang lamb, WAGYU beef, Charred Kurobuta Pork chop, Spanner crabs and E-Fu noodles. Dishes I don't care for - broccoli, oysters, potato and drunken chicken. The $158 chef's premium selection of sushi and sashimi is definitely not worth ordering. Service is slow and lack attention. A bite into the food and is obvious this is more western culinary cooking  than Asian. Almost every dishes have the same seasoning except the lamb. If you looking for Chinese food, this is definitely not the go-to place especially when you are in Singapore. Just like any other bar we have been since our arrival, the drinks are very expensive because alcohol portion in our cocktails is very minimal. There are very limited restaurant seating with view of skyline. I would recommend eating by the bar area that is actually on the balcony with better view. Overall, this is something you visit for the experience and less likely a dinning rendezvous for Chinese food."

You can pay the fee to be able to go to the observation area but getting a drink at the bar costs about the same so might as well get something out of it. We made reservations and was seated right away. The decor is a modern asian, dark, and romantic atmosphere. The music is blasting but you can still hear each other. You definitely can't beat the view from the restaurant, but if you go to the adjacent lounge/bar, there's a perfect photo op.The menu has a lot of different options so we decided to try a few things and share. We started with one of their cocktails, the botanist, it wasn't garnished with anything and didn't look like anything special. The taste was good but nothing to rave about. We ordered the grilled prawns, prawn roll and the calamari. The grilled prawns were overcooked and the sauce that was with it needed more flavor or at least have the shrimp marinated in it so it has time to soak up the flavor. The calamari was one big piece, it was lightly fried but again nothing special. The prawn roll was good but overpriced for sure. For dessert we got the rose watermelon dessert which was a cool concept and delicious. Dessert was the best part but again overpriced. I don't mind paying a high price for the meal if the meal tastes good and the experience is worth it. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to my friends who are planning to travel there, unless it was just to grab a drink at the bar."

Usually when there is pay to go up a tall building or go up for free if you eat or drink at the restaurant, the second option is better.  HOWEVER, in this case I would suggest just paying to go up to the skydeck.  There are several options to go up.  Be a hotel guest.  Pay for the skydeckEat at Ce La vi, Spago, or LavoHaving been to other Spagos and Lavo locations I'm not a fan so I crossed those off my list.  CÉ LA VI Restaurant menu did not look good but i was willing bite the bullet to go up.  At first they said there were reservation spots open but then they changed their story so now my option is to pay 23 bucks to go up to the bar.  You can use the 23 dollar voucher to pay for your bill so effectively the entry fee up is zero. After going up I see that the best option would have been to just pay 23 bucks for the skydeck.  The bar is like recessed in from the skydeck.  So imagine a half circle and the bar is in the middle while the skydeck surrounds it.  This means that if you are on the skydeck you can walk up to the edge for unobstructed views while you get this crappy obstructed view from the bar area.  It's like sitting outside vs inside at an oceanfront restaurant.  The service was also HORRIBLE... like seriously, service is horrible pretty much everywhere in SG, even at the expensive spots.  The drinks might as well have been virgin as there were basically no alcohol in them.  You also cannot see the infinity pool from the bar area.  There is a separate lounge portion which had a private event so we couldn't look at it. TOP TIP: the best view from the bar is actually out back past the restrooms.  You get an unobstructed view of the gardens by the bay and of Ferris wheel."

First off, when I made a reservation for dinner the website made it look like the tables were private from the bar area where anyone can walk-in but instead we were seated in an area that was attached to the bar with people on both sides of us. It was marked off with some potted plants and red velvety type ropes but it was definitely not private and you are still pretty much in the bar. To their bonus, they do a good job of keeping the bar patrons out of the dining area as several tried to enter but it is a little disruptive being right next to the bar. I was pleasantly surprised by 1) the view which was absolutely stellar. Even better than the viewing deck below as it's completely unobstructed. We were just in awe at how gorgeous it was, and 2) the food. Yes, I had somewhat of low expectations of the food as when a place has some sort of gimmick (i.e. view) the food isn't always their focal point. However, the food here was really impressive. The standouts were the foie gras - prepared perfectly seared and topped with yuzu jelly pomegranate reduction (heaven!) and the roasted lemongrass chicken with eggplant, zucchini, & a kaffir lime green chili sauce. Ce La Vi is definitely worth a visit if you are staying in Singapore or at Marina Bay Sands. It is a little pricey but very worth it as the food was delicious and the views are second to none - just don't expect a private evening. ;)"

Guests of the hotel do not have to stand in line. I did not have food but I met friends for drink and all of the drinks were pretty awful if I'm being honest. They were over priced as well. I think one was $22 and there was absolutely noting special about it. Service also left a lot to be desired. Seems like we waited forever to get the few drinks we did order. I'd go back just for the view but I'd probably just order beer (Singapore doesn't really have good beer) next time.

My friends and I were out all day being tourists and didn't realize that this place had a dress code. Thankfully, we were able to get in with our comfy gear on (tennis shoes, jeans, regular tops/jersey) since it was complimentary Ladies Night and that we all happened to be girls. However, we did get quite the stare down from the hostess and security that made us feel quite uncomfortable. Despite us being a bit under dressed, we made the trek up to the roof top bar. Unfortunately, the observatory deck was closed to the public but you could still wander around the bar area and see the city through various spots. Tried to take some pictures but there was just too many people clustered around the areas where you could peek out to see the view. As for the bar itself, it took a really long time to even put in an order (given that this was a Wednesday night) so my friends and I just left. Throughout our experience, we kept getting stopped by the staff to ask if we were going to drink and the pressure to buy something is pretty strong here.Overall, not quite worth the time to visit this place if you're only here to see the city view."

We snapped photos of the bay along with everyone else and slowly sipped our drinks (the cocktails pack a punch--I had the Penicillin, a whiskey concoction).

It took forever to flag down anyone. One of the girls in my party had a slight cough and needed water, but it took over 15 minutes and us asking several times before we actually got the water. It also took a while to order; instead of the waiter coming to take our order, we had to ask to order. The food itself was decent but definitely expensive for what it was.

I mean, you can't really miss the Marina Bay Sands hotel!Although we made reservations, we still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared. This gave us the chance to check out the attached bar/club. This was where we got the best views available to restaurant patrons. (There is an even better observation deck, but that's reserved for hotel guests only.)We also got drinks while we waited as well. As other reviews state, everything here is overpriced, but it comes with the territory so set your expectations (and budget) accordingly. The only real complaint from our visit is that the bar staff got confused and tried to charge me twice for the drinks. It was resolved quickly, just in time for us to be seated.We were comfortably seated outdoors on an elevated and covered area. This was probably for the best as other tourists and visitors crowd the perimeter tables to try and get the best photos of the skyline - something you don't want to deal with when you're trying to enjoy your meal.Service was attentive, although it could've been a little quicker. Food, much like the drinks, was overpriced, but still pretty good. I expected to be blown away, but don't quite remember any exceptional bites.Overall, it was a good meal and a good experience.

He called the night before to reserve a covered table on the patio and we got an excellent view from the corner of the deck. We both ordered the brunch ($98 each), which included oysters, salmon sashimi, tuna tataki, prawn salad with glass noodle, cucumber salad, prawn and vegetable tempura, and miso soup in addition to a main course selection and juice, coffee, tea and soft drinks. I ordered the donburi (pork belly, mix vegetables with chili garlic, teriyaki). I was very pleased with all of the food, but will say it was definitely a Paleo cheat meal. I did my best to avoid the tempura, rice and soy-based food, but know that it was impossible to avoid completely. The gentleman who seated us was very nice, but other than that, the service was lack luster and one woman was borderline rude.I thought it was a unique experience with a really gorgeous view of Singapore, and the people watching was awesome.

I don't mind paying top $ for great food but my experience did not impress me. We ordered two appetizers - fish ceviche and wagyu tartar. Plates came with a tiny bit of food without any taste. For main entrees we had cod - just average. Dessert came fussy with nitro on a board.. mango cheesecake that also disappointed us. 4 out of 10 stars at best and extremely expensive. View is ok.. you will be better off going to the bar than paying so much for below average food on this restaurant.

That's one hundred dollars for water. We had the sashimi and sushi platter that was literally brought out one minute after we ordered it and the fish were warm and well tasted fishy not in a good way. Then we were told we needed tickets to the sky park to get to the restaurant which was not true at all. Since we prepurchased tickets we thought we would go there after since it looked like great views that weren't exactly accessible from the restaurant and with that idea the nightmarish experience continued. The guy working there sent us to the wrong elevator that didn't have the 56th floor that we needed. We finally get redirected to the correct elevator and get to the sky park entrance and the lady tells us we have to go all the way down to b1 to scan our tickets. We tell her the restaurant told us to come down since we had the QR code but the lady says no. Meanwhile there are 100+ people waiting in line to get down from the sky park and they cram you in to overfill the elevators so you can't move or breathe. Needless to say we didn't go back up there. We just wasted our money and left. Anyways, what a waste of money and a night. I had a far more enjoyable night at the lantern (Fullerton hotel) looking at the marina bay sands."

Okay so let start out with the location, this club is located at marina bay sands tower 3, there be a reception right at the lobby where you get checked in and you will receive a card if your on guestlist to be given to another reception counter at 57 floor. If you felt like you had a hard day of work and your urban scape kinda person, the view up there is amazing at night no doubt. What makes it amazing it is because its not fully glass caged like your in a fish tank. For members they have sofas and rectangle tables to kick back and relax on, but if your not there are plenty of standing tables near the entrance where you can enjoy your favorite drink, view and music.Interior, there nothing much to describe really, when you walk into the club its pretty dim setting, so there nothing fancy much you can see.. Pretty standard sofas by the side of the dance floor for you people who feeling rich, you can ball all you want. Its not really big, sits max 4 each side. The feeling you get is a very beach setting in a sheltered environment but its actually a open air club. You can't really feel the air con if you're vividly dancing around like a bunny to impress some girls.Dance floorMy favourite segment, they have a really huge space for you to glide around which i really love. But it get crowded too early and especially the crowd there are mostly expats in the 30s and we asian are small built, best part we are dancers so we dont need a football field to bust a move.ServiceThe servers are efficient, polite and professional. Although the orders took awhile to reach it makes up for the service we had. The only set back we had was the door bitches, i believe they can handle the situation better by being more approachable, smiley and not by living your stage name as a door bitch. We had some issues with the guestlist as they miscalculated or some information was not communicated properly but it was all good in the end.Conclusion It is a definete place to checkout, chill have a beer or whatever you feel like.. Or dance till you drop retarded."

Of course the views are impeccable since it i the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, but the food was average and over-priced.  Both my husband and I were excited about the miso black cod they had on the menu, but it turned out to be such a small portion and the fish was not cooked well.

Most of the are spot on but I think it depends on your own experience.First, I made reservations 2 hours before. I was surprised it was that easy but it was a Wed night. To get to the restaurant you must wait in line at Tower 3. If you have a reservation or going to the bar they will give you a red entry ticket. The elevator only goes to the top so there is no stopping. When you get out there are numerous people around to ensure you get to where your going. But most important ensure you do not get access to where you're not supposed to.First, the wait staff is out of this world. Never had an empty glass, always attentive, napkin in lap 3 times, amazing!  The staff gets 2 stars alone. Second, the food. Eh. I ordered the Salmon and it was just ""ok"". This place is ala carte so when ordering Salmon, you only get Salmon. I had to order a bowl of rice just to make sure I felt like I was eating something. Half star for food only because I the Salmon was that of a chain restaurant. My salmon, a bowl of rice and water and it was over $S100. So yes, it's expensive.The views from this side of the rooftop bar is not that great. You have to go to the Lounge for the stunning views. Read my review on that as well. So other than being expensive for what you get I say 2 stars for the service, 1/2 star for the food and a half star for the location."

There is a lot of fan fare around the menu presentation, putting little lights on so you could see in the semi-darkness, but beyond that we were waving down anyone who came near us. Food was great. All sharing style--we had raw oysters (not much can go wrong), the beef carpaccio was nice simply because the cut of beef was to die for, sushi rolls were pulled-from-the-sea but we had to ask for more wasabi, sashimi salad was very nice. The lamb was tasty and cooked to perfection, the seared scallops were overpowered by some overrout foam perched on the top, the pork belly was fabulous, perfectly seasoned and the grilled halibut was a real treat. For dessert, the garam masala cake was a sweet ending to the meal as was the chocolate fondant. Sounds like we had a lot (I didn't even mention everything) but really just small bites and pretty much everything was delicious, but without distinction for the price. You pay for the view and it's worth it. Singapore at your feet is very delightful--the 57th floor overlooking everything--ahhhhhh. Make sure you bring plenty of Sing dollars!"

When each course came the waiter just quickly set it down and walked away, with no explanation of what it was. The bill comes and I charged it to my room, they needed the room key for verification. Waiter walks away and never comes back. I finally walked over to waiter station asking for my room key back. They claimed they gave it back which they did not, turns out they lost. Took them 35 minutes to find it. The dinner took about 2.5 hours with most of the time wasted waiting on service.

Far more than I expected.I didn't try the food, and the drinks were insanely expensive. I came here to watch the sunset while having drinks with friends. It was a mix of classy, casual, business, and elegant all at once. There were people who had been at the pool all day, others who were there for an after work drink, guests of the casino downstairs, and tourists like me  all in the same place.

Being part of the Marina Bay Sands extravaganza, i knew it would be pricey, but i also knew it could be quite an unforgettable experience- and it did not disappoint!My friend and i had just been on a holiday through Germany and Switzerland over the Christmas and new year period, and had a few days in Singapore to thaw out and recover somewhat from our jet lag. Being the last night of our holiday, we wanted to do something memorable and a little bit fancy. After being recommended by friends that we ""must go to The Raffles and have a Singapore Sling"", and being slightly disappointed with the result, we decided to rely on our trusty Yelp app and see what else Singapore had to offer. Ku De Ta promptly popped up on the list,  i had heard about the views from the sky deck previously from a work colleague so flicked through some recent reviews. By booking in to the restaurant we didn't have to pay the usual $20 to get to the sky deck, so we went up early and had a drink at the sky bar. We were greeted quickly by multiple friendly staff, and very soon we were sipping on cocktails and taking in the view- and what a view it was! With 180 degree uninterrupted views across the city and the bay, i would've been quite happy to pay the $20 for the view alone. It really is fantastic.The staff at Ku De Ta are brilliant. They're attentive and friendly, and go out of their way to make you as comfortable as possible. The menu is designed in a way that you are inclined to order a bunch of smaller dishes to share, so that's what we did.We ordered about five dishes to share, and all of them were exceptional. The mushroom, the pork, the scallops- all perfectly cooked, the flavours were balanced and there were a nice combination of different textures too. The dishes were all plated with care, it was obvious the chef had thought of all aspects of the dining experience when creating the menu. I suppose the only downfall of the whole experience was the dessert- the flavours were surprisingly bland after such fresh and enjoyable combinations in the previous course; and yes, the wine and other alcoholic drinks we ordered with our meal and afterwards at the bar were really pricey. But, from what i could tell, alcohol anywhere in Singapore is pricey!All in all, it was an amazing experience, the views were phenomenal (especially once the sun set), the wait staff are friendly and attentive and the food although not the cheapest around, was delicious, well presented and creative. Would i go back next time i'm in Singapore? Absolutely! For a special last-night-out meal and a fantastic cocktail with the best view of the city- you can't get better than Ku De Ta! I'd probably skip the bottle of wine with dinner to save a couple of bucks next time though... ;-)"

I don't know if this is always the case, we were allowed to go by the lounge part after eating and take pictures at a glass partition(half wall) where you get the cityscape view and infinity pool. It was jaw dropping at night. Because of being at an outer table and being able to take pictures of pool and city it was well worth the money. But since they won't guarantee an outer table...? This is actually the highlight of our trip so far.  We pre budgeted by looking at menu online beforehand and didn't order appetizer or drinks and paid $300 Singapore dollar. We had two entrees, a shared side, and the medium dessert sampler. Food was YUMMY!"

For a table of 7 we started off with prawns (delicious sauce and would recommend) and grilled octopus (soft, flavorful...highly recommend). For mains we had a mix of well seasoned Bombay potatoes (garam masala, mustard, cumin...yummy) with their grilled spring chicken for 3 (just okay), smoked black cods that came in two circle shaped filets with the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms on the opposite side of the plate (fish was a cooked a bit on the oily side but still presentable and edible), sea bass  in a fish broth and Thai basil  for two  (one finished it all and the other ate half).  Special dessert was in a bed of ice and shot glasses filled with watermelon fruit on the bottom and raspberry sorbet on top. Instagram worthy. Service at the table was great. Service prior to seating was not so great because the host was trying to give us a table inside when we had requested outside we'll in advance. They tried to say that those were reserved but yet we saw no one sitting there. And then the manager was trying to tell us that of it rains that we have no table. He wasn't happy about giving us the table outside when we pressed him on giving us the outside table. Through out the evening it didn't even rain once. So many patrons came to eat and there were tables left empty where we sat. Poor execution on the management's seating arrangement."

Came here for cocktails but ended eating too. It came as a surprise we were able to get a table of 5 without reservation on a Saturday evening. Obviously prices were on the high side considering portion sizes. Here is a quick run down of the dishes I liked - Xinjiang lamb, WAGYU beef, Charred Kurobuta Pork chop, Spanner crabs and E-Fu noodles. Dishes I don't care for - broccoli, oysters, potato and drunken chicken. The $158 chef's premium selection of sushi and sashimi is definitely not worth ordering. Service is slow and lack attention. A bite into the food and is obvious this is more western culinary cooking  than Asian. Almost every dishes have the same seasoning except the lamb. If you looking for Chinese food, this is definitely not the go-to place especially when you are in Singapore. Just like any other bar we have been since our arrival, the drinks are very expensive because alcohol portion in our cocktails is very minimal. There are very limited restaurant seating with view of skyline. I would recommend eating by the bar area that is actually on the balcony with better view. Overall, this is something you visit for the experience and less likely a dinning rendezvous for Chinese food."

You definitely can't beat the view from the restaurant, but if you go to the adjacent lounge/bar, there's a perfect photo op.The menu has a lot of different options so we decided to try a few things and share. We started with one of their cocktails, the botanist, it wasn't garnished with anything and didn't look like anything special. The taste was good but nothing to rave about. We ordered the grilled prawns, prawn roll and the calamari. The grilled prawns were overcooked and the sauce that was with it needed more flavor or at least have the shrimp marinated in it so it has time to soak up the flavor. The calamari was one big piece, it was lightly fried but again nothing special. The prawn roll was good but overpriced for sure. For dessert we got the rose watermelon dessert which was a cool concept and delicious. Dessert was the best part but again overpriced. I don't mind paying a high price for the meal if the meal tastes good and the experience is worth it.

I don't know if this is always the case, we were allowed to go by the lounge part after eating and take pictures at a glass partition(half wall) where you get the cityscape view and infinity pool. It was jaw dropping at night. Because of being at an outer table and being able to take pictures of pool and city it was well worth the money. But since they won't guarantee an outer table...? This is actually the highlight of our trip so far.  We pre budgeted by looking at menu online beforehand and didn't order appetizer or drinks and paid $300 Singapore dollar.

In addition, I would highly recommend going on a day when the weather is clear as they close the outdoor part of the bar when the weather is rainy or stormy. Overall, a beautiful spot just somewhat overpriced for what you get."

Guests of the hotel do not have to stand in line. I did not have food but I met friends for drink and all of the drinks were pretty awful if I'm being honest. They were over priced as well. I think one was $22 and there was absolutely noting special about it. Service also left a lot to be desired. Seems like we waited forever to get the few drinks we did order. I'd go back just for the view but I'd probably just order beer (Singapore doesn't really have good beer) next time.

Making reservations was a simple phone call away, and getting there is quite easy. I mean, you can't really miss the Marina Bay Sands hotel!Although we made reservations, we still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared. This gave us the chance to check out the attached bar/club. This was where we got the best views available to restaurant patrons. (There is an even better observation deck, but that's reserved for hotel guests only.)We also got drinks while we waited as well. As other reviews state, everything here is overpriced, but it comes with the territory so set your expectations (and budget) accordingly. The only real complaint from our visit is that the bar staff got confused and tried to charge me twice for the drinks. It was resolved quickly, just in time for us to be seated.We were comfortably seated outdoors on an elevated and covered area. This was probably for the best as other tourists and visitors crowd the perimeter tables to try and get the best photos of the skyline - something you don't want to deal with when you're trying to enjoy your meal.Service was attentive, although it could've been a little quicker. Food, much like the drinks, was overpriced, but still pretty good. I expected to be blown away, but don't quite remember any exceptional bites.Overall, it was a good meal and a good experience.

The view was amazing, with all the lights of Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay; that's undeniable.The service was terrible. The servers were nice, but the restaurant felt severely understaffed. It took forever to flag down anyone. One of the girls in my party had a slight cough and needed water, but it took over 15 minutes and us asking several times before we actually got the water.

He called the night before to reserve a covered table on the patio and we got an excellent view from the corner of the deck. We both ordered the brunch ($98 each), which included oysters, salmon sashimi, tuna tataki, prawn salad with glass noodle, cucumber salad, prawn and vegetable tempura, and miso soup in addition to a main course selection and juice, coffee, tea and soft drinks. I ordered the donburi (pork belly, mix vegetables with chili garlic, teriyaki). I was very pleased with all of the food, but will say it was definitely a Paleo cheat meal. I did my best to avoid the tempura, rice and soy-based food, but know that it was impossible to avoid completely. The gentleman who seated us was very nice, but other than that, the service was lack luster and one woman was borderline rude.I thought it was a unique experience with a really gorgeous view of Singapore, and the people watching was awesome.

I don't mind paying top $ for great food but my experience did not impress me. We ordered two appetizers - fish ceviche and wagyu tartar. Plates came with a tiny bit of food without any taste. For main entrees we had cod - just average. Dessert came fussy with nitro on a board.. mango cheesecake that also disappointed us. 4 out of 10 stars at best and extremely expensive. View is ok.. you will be better off going to the bar than paying so much for below average food on this restaurant.

That's one hundred dollars for water. We had the sashimi and sushi platter that was literally brought out one minute after we ordered it and the fish were warm and well tasted fishy not in a good way. Then we were told we needed tickets to the sky park to get to the restaurant which was not true at all. Since we prepurchased tickets we thought we would go there after since it looked like great views that weren't exactly accessible from the restaurant and with that idea the nightmarish experience continued. The guy working there sent us to the wrong elevator that didn't have the 56th floor that we needed. We finally get redirected to the correct elevator and get to the sky park entrance and the lady tells us we have to go all the way down to b1 to scan our tickets. We tell her the restaurant told us to come down since we had the QR code but the lady says no. Meanwhile there are 100+ people waiting in line to get down from the sky park and they cram you in to overfill the elevators so you can't move or breathe. Needless to say we didn't go back up there. We just wasted our money and left. Anyways, what a waste of money and a night. I had a far more enjoyable night at the lantern (Fullerton hotel) looking at the marina bay sands."

From  the top of this restaurant on the 57th floor we can see the whole  main city of the garden by the bay and the ""trees""  the ocean  filled with cargo ships, the domes that look like gigantic seashells by the shore, and then lights into the evening. For a table of 7 we started off with prawns (delicious sauce and would recommend) and grilled octopus (soft, flavorful...highly recommend). For mains we had a mix of well seasoned Bombay potatoes (garam masala, mustard, cumin...yummy) with their grilled spring chicken for 3 (just okay), smoked black cods that came in two circle shaped filets with the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms on the opposite side of the plate (fish was a cooked a bit on the oily side but still presentable and edible), sea bass  in a fish broth and Thai basil  for two  (one finished it all and the other ate half).  Special dessert was in a bed of ice and shot glasses filled with watermelon fruit on the bottom and raspberry sorbet on top. Instagram worthy. Service at the table was great. Service prior to seating was not so great because the host was trying to give us a table inside when we had requested outside we'll in advance. They tried to say that those were reserved but yet we saw no one sitting there. And then the manager was trying to tell us that of it rains that we have no table. He wasn't happy about giving us the table outside when we pressed him on giving us the outside table. Through out the evening it didn't even rain once. So many patrons came to eat and there were tables left empty where we sat. Poor execution on the management's seating arrangement."

Came here for cocktails but ended eating too. It came as a surprise we were able to get a table of 5 without reservation on a Saturday evening. Obviously prices were on the high side considering portion sizes. Here is a quick run down of the dishes I liked - Xinjiang lamb, WAGYU beef, Charred Kurobuta Pork chop, Spanner crabs and E-Fu noodles. Dishes I don't care for - broccoli, oysters, potato and drunken chicken. The $158 chef's premium selection of sushi and sashimi is definitely not worth ordering. Service is slow and lack attention. A bite into the food and is obvious this is more western culinary cooking  than Asian. Almost every dishes have the same seasoning except the lamb. If you looking for Chinese food, this is definitely not the go-to place especially when you are in Singapore. Just like any other bar we have been since our arrival, the drinks are very expensive because alcohol portion in our cocktails is very minimal. There are very limited restaurant seating with view of skyline. I would recommend eating by the bar area that is actually on the balcony with better view. Overall, this is something you visit for the experience and less likely a dinning rendezvous for Chinese food."

We made reservations and was seated right away. The decor is a modern asian, dark, and romantic atmosphere. The music is blasting but you can still hear each other. You definitely can't beat the view from the restaurant, but if you go to the adjacent lounge/bar, there's a perfect photo op.The menu has a lot of different options so we decided to try a few things and share. We started with one of their cocktails, the botanist, it wasn't garnished with anything and didn't look like anything special. The taste was good but nothing to rave about. We ordered the grilled prawns, prawn roll and the calamari. The grilled prawns were overcooked and the sauce that was with it needed more flavor or at least have the shrimp marinated in it so it has time to soak up the flavor. The calamari was one big piece, it was lightly fried but again nothing special. The prawn roll was good but overpriced for sure. For dessert we got the rose watermelon dessert which was a cool concept and delicious. Dessert was the best part but again overpriced. I don't mind paying a high price for the meal if the meal tastes good and the experience is worth it. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to my friends who are planning to travel there, unless it was just to grab a drink at the bar."

Usually when there is pay to go up a tall building or go up for free if you eat or drink at the restaurant, the second option is better.  HOWEVER, in this case I would suggest just paying to go up to the skydeck.  There are several options to go up.  Be a hotel guest.  Pay for the skydeckEat at Ce La vi, Spago, or LavoHaving been to other Spagos and Lavo locations I'm not a fan so I crossed those off my list.  CÉ LA VI Restaurant menu did not look good but i was willing bite the bullet to go up.  At first they said there were reservation spots open but then they changed their story so now my option is to pay 23 bucks to go up to the bar.  You can use the 23 dollar voucher to pay for your bill so effectively the entry fee up is zero. After going up I see that the best option would have been to just pay 23 bucks for the skydeck.  The bar is like recessed in from the skydeck.  So imagine a half circle and the bar is in the middle while the skydeck surrounds it.  This means that if you are on the skydeck you can walk up to the edge for unobstructed views while you get this crappy obstructed view from the bar area.  It's like sitting outside vs inside at an oceanfront restaurant.  The service was also HORRIBLE... like seriously, service is horrible pretty much everywhere in SG, even at the expensive spots.  The drinks might as well have been virgin as there were basically no alcohol in them.  You also cannot see the infinity pool from the bar area.  There is a separate lounge portion which had a private event so we couldn't look at it.

First off, when I made a reservation for dinner the website made it look like the tables were private from the bar area where anyone can walk-in but instead we were seated in an area that was attached to the bar with people on both sides of us. It was marked off with some potted plants and red velvety type ropes but it was definitely not private and you are still pretty much in the bar. To their bonus, they do a good job of keeping the bar patrons out of the dining area as several tried to enter but it is a little disruptive being right next to the bar. I was pleasantly surprised by 1) the view which was absolutely stellar. Even better than the viewing deck below as it's completely unobstructed. We were just in awe at how gorgeous it was, and 2) the food. Yes, I had somewhat of low expectations of the food as when a place has some sort of gimmick (i.e. view) the food isn't always their focal point. However, the food here was really impressive. The standouts were the foie gras - prepared perfectly seared and topped with yuzu jelly pomegranate reduction (heaven!) and the roasted lemongrass chicken with eggplant, zucchini, & a kaffir lime green chili sauce. Ce La Vi is definitely worth a visit if you are staying in Singapore or at Marina Bay Sands. It is a little pricey but very worth it as the food was delicious and the views are second to none - just don't expect a private evening. ;)"

There are amazing views from the terrace and the vibe is chilled. The line to get up to the restaurant is extremely long and packed with people who are not guests of the hotel. Guests of the hotel do not have to stand in line. I did not have food but I met friends for drink and all of the drinks were pretty awful if I'm being honest. They were over priced as well. I think one was $22 and there was absolutely noting special about it. Service also left a lot to be desired. Seems like we waited forever to get the few drinks we did order. I'd go back just for the view but I'd probably just order beer (Singapore doesn't really have good beer) next time. This would be a good place to go with friends being that you don't have to pay to get in and the atmosphere is relaxed.Not so humbly submitted,Michael C."

My friends and I were out all day being tourists and didn't realize that this place had a dress code. Thankfully, we were able to get in with our comfy gear on (tennis shoes, jeans, regular tops/jersey) since it was complimentary Ladies Night and that we all happened to be girls. However, we did get quite the stare down from the hostess and security that made us feel quite uncomfortable. Despite us being a bit under dressed, we made the trek up to the roof top bar. Unfortunately, the observatory deck was closed to the public but you could still wander around the bar area and see the city through various spots. Tried to take some pictures but there was just too many people clustered around the areas where you could peek out to see the view. As for the bar itself, it took a really long time to even put in an order (given that this was a Wednesday night) so my friends and I just left. Throughout our experience, we kept getting stopped by the staff to ask if we were going to drink and the pressure to buy something is pretty strong here.Overall, not quite worth the time to visit this place if you're only here to see the city view."

KU DE TA is directly adjacent to the infinity pool, so you get amazing views looking into the city while youre at the bar. The service, however, is terrible. It may have been so bad at the particular time I went because there was a private party, and many of the servers looked occupied with that. We sat ourselves, got our own menus and had to go to the bar to order. The menus looked old and the pages were creased and unprofessional looking, the drinks were expensive and we had to ask 3 times for glasses of water. In conclusion, you pay for the awesome views. That's it. You don't pay for nice menus or impeccable service. I was disappointed to say the least. I would even venture to say that if I go again to see the view and the service is just as terrible, I'll take my photos and leave without getting a drink.

The view was amazing, with all the lights of Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay; that's undeniable.The service was terrible. The servers were nice, but the restaurant felt severely understaffed. It took forever to flag down anyone. One of the girls in my party had a slight cough and needed water, but it took over 15 minutes and us asking several times before we actually got the water. It also took a while to order; instead of the waiter coming to take our order, we had to ask to order. The food itself was decent but definitely expensive for what it was. That was expected though, since I assume we're paying partly for the view. I'd suggest to just come up here for drinks rather than a full meal."

Making reservations was a simple phone call away, and getting there is quite easy. I mean, you can't really miss the Marina Bay Sands hotel!Although we made reservations, we still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared. This gave us the chance to check out the attached bar/club. This was where we got the best views available to restaurant patrons. (There is an even better observation deck, but that's reserved for hotel guests only.)We also got drinks while we waited as well. As other reviews state, everything here is overpriced, but it comes with the territory so set your expectations (and budget) accordingly. The only real complaint from our visit is that the bar staff got confused and tried to charge me twice for the drinks. It was resolved quickly, just in time for us to be seated.We were comfortably seated outdoors on an elevated and covered area. This was probably for the best as other tourists and visitors crowd the perimeter tables to try and get the best photos of the skyline - something you don't want to deal with when you're trying to enjoy your meal.Service was attentive, although it could've been a little quicker. Food, much like the drinks, was overpriced, but still pretty good. I expected to be blown away, but don't quite remember any exceptional bites.Overall, it was a good meal and a good experience. Just be sure to adjust your expectations, consider the experience and value as a whole, and you'll have a great time."

The food was subpar. Steak was cooked to correct temperature but the overall dish lacked balance.

It used to be called Ku De Ta. It has a a really good vibe and I must say I love it. There is a night club nearby and this place classifies as a pre bar or club because it closed at 11pm. They serve some pretty nice drinks with a good view. I wish they did not have to close early. Singapore has a good night life and this place rally seals the deal. I usually drive up in the bottom floor and pay the parking fare before coming here. If you want to go somewhere else after 11pm then that is the best thing to do.  They have a live DJ that plays anything from familiar song remixes to total EDM. You will not regret this place.

My husband had been once before with a colleague and insisted we check it out. He informed us that we'd have to pay to get to the deck for the views and that it was worth it to go up to eat. He called the night before to reserve a covered table on the patio and we got an excellent view from the corner of the deck. We both ordered the brunch ($98 each), which included oysters, salmon sashimi, tuna tataki, prawn salad with glass noodle, cucumber salad, prawn and vegetable tempura, and miso soup in addition to a main course selection and juice, coffee, tea and soft drinks. I ordered the donburi (pork belly, mix vegetables with chili garlic, teriyaki). I was very pleased with all of the food, but will say it was definitely a Paleo cheat meal. I did my best to avoid the tempura, rice and soy-based food, but know that it was impossible to avoid completely. The gentleman who seated us was very nice, but other than that, the service was lack luster and one woman was borderline rude.I thought it was a unique experience with a really gorgeous view of Singapore, and the people watching was awesome. This is not a place that we will frequent because on top of the expensive spread, parking wasn't fun and neither was navigating the mall to get there.

You spend a couple hundred dollars and for what?! It was so crowded that you couldn't really enjoy the views. We had vodka sodas that had no vodka in them and they cost nearly $100. That's one hundred dollars for water. We had the sashimi and sushi platter that was literally brought out one minute after we ordered it and the fish were warm and well tasted fishy not in a good way. Then we were told we needed tickets to the sky park to get to the restaurant which was not true at all. Since we prepurchased tickets we thought we would go there after since it looked like great views that weren't exactly accessible from the restaurant and with that idea the nightmarish experience continued. The guy working there sent us to the wrong elevator that didn't have the 56th floor that we needed. We finally get redirected to the correct elevator and get to the sky park entrance and the lady tells us we have to go all the way down to b1 to scan our tickets. We tell her the restaurant told us to come down since we had the QR code but the lady says no. Meanwhile there are 100+ people waiting in line to get down from the sky park and they cram you in to overfill the elevators so you can't move or breathe. Needless to say we didn't go back up there. We just wasted our money and left. Anyways, what a waste of money and a night. I had a far more enjoyable night at the lantern (Fullerton hotel) looking at the marina bay sands."

Okay so let start out with the location, this club is located at marina bay sands tower 3, there be a reception right at the lobby where you get checked in and you will receive a card if your on guestlist to be given to another reception counter at 57 floor. If you felt like you had a hard day of work and your urban scape kinda person, the view up there is amazing at night no doubt. What makes it amazing it is because its not fully glass caged like your in a fish tank. For members they have sofas and rectangle tables to kick back and relax on, but if your not there are plenty of standing tables near the entrance where you can enjoy your favorite drink, view and music.Interior, there nothing much to describe really, when you walk into the club its pretty dim setting, so there nothing fancy much you can see.. Pretty standard sofas by the side of the dance floor for you people who feeling rich, you can ball all you want. Its not really big, sits max 4 each side. The feeling you get is a very beach setting in a sheltered environment but its actually a open air club. You can't really feel the air con if you're vividly dancing around like a bunny to impress some girls.Dance floorMy favourite segment, they have a really huge space for you to glide around which i really love. But it get crowded too early and especially the crowd there are mostly expats in the 30s and we asian are small built, best part we are dancers so we dont need a football field to bust a move.ServiceThe servers are efficient, polite and professional. Although the orders took awhile to reach it makes up for the service we had. The only set back we had was the door bitches, i believe they can handle the situation better by being more approachable, smiley and not by living your stage name as a door bitch. We had some issues with the guestlist as they miscalculated or some information was not communicated properly but it was all good in the end.Conclusion It is a definete place to checkout, chill have a beer or whatever you feel like.. Or dance till you drop retarded."

Of course the views are impeccable since it i the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, but the food was average and over-priced.  Both my husband and I were excited about the miso black cod they had on the menu, but it turned out to be such a small portion and the fish was not cooked well.

It is an indoor and outdoor space on the roof of Marina Bay Sands hotel, which has a restaurant, bar and nightclub. Pros:1) Great panoramic view of Singapore. 2) Cocktails were excellent and the bar puts a unique twist on some of the classics (ex. Adding charred orange and cherry to an old fashioned). Cons:1) After 6pm, they enforce a dress code, which requires pants for men (in a roasting Singaporean climate!)2) We were there around lunch time on a not-busy week day and service was slow."

Most of the are spot on but I think it depends on your own experience.First, I made reservations 2 hours before. I was surprised it was that easy but it was a Wed night. To get to the restaurant you must wait in line at Tower 3. If you have a reservation or going to the bar they will give you a red entry ticket. The elevator only goes to the top so there is no stopping. When you get out there are numerous people around to ensure you get to where your going. But most important ensure you do not get access to where you're not supposed to.First, the wait staff is out of this world. Never had an empty glass, always attentive, napkin in lap 3 times, amazing!  The staff gets 2 stars alone. Second, the food. Eh. I ordered the Salmon and it was just ""ok"". This place is ala carte so when ordering Salmon, you only get Salmon. I had to order a bowl of rice just to make sure I felt like I was eating something. Half star for food only because I the Salmon was that of a chain restaurant. My salmon, a bowl of rice and water and it was over $S100. So yes, it's expensive.The views from this side of the rooftop bar is not that great. You have to go to the Lounge for the stunning views. Read my review on that as well. So other than being expensive for what you get I say 2 stars for the service, 1/2 star for the food and a half star for the location."

I had to go back to my hotel and order a 2nd dinner because there was no way to eat the disaster they were trying to feed everyone.

I was immediately stopped by the lady downstairs because of my shorts. I didn't want to disappoint my group so I went shopping for a pair of pants in the casino mall. Everything was expensive there. I wish there was a Costco or Walmart. But even the usual brands such as Gap cost at least twice as much as in the US. Finally I found a cargo pants at Guess marked down from S$120 to S$40 (~$32). I wouldn't pay $10 for it if I didn't have to go to the top.When we got to the top, first thing we noticed was that the bar area is separated from the observation deck and guarded. To see the view, you have to look beyond the observation deck, which makes the view from the bar obscured. The bar area is tiny and crowded. It turns out if you are only having drinks, you have to stand.A small beer costs S$16 and a small cocktail costs S$23. I've had way better drinks. They make the $20 martini on top of the Park Hyatt Shinjuku so worth it. We had seven people including two little kids. The first thing the waitress asked us was why we ordered only five drinks. BTW Singapore's legal drinking age is also 21.I walked around a little trying to catch different views. When I walked back to the bar area, I was stopped by a waiter asking if I was going to buy a drink.The view on the top, even without being obscured, is not that great. You can go to many high grounds (and free) in Hong Kong and have way better view of the skyline.I think they made one fundamental mistake - that is in order to stop a few lookie loo, they pissed many paying customers. Very different from how things are done here in the US."

Our Sky Park experience ended with a noon cocktail. My mother had a rum-based orange drink while I had a vodka-based peach drink. I know it may sound weird, but surprisingly, it felt really good. The drinks were mixed well, we weren't able to taste that overwhelming alcohol. Just plain tropical refreshing goodness.

When each course came the waiter just quickly set it down and walked away, with no explanation of what it was. The bill comes and I charged it to my room, they needed the room key for verification. Waiter walks away and never comes back. I finally walked over to waiter station asking for my room key back. They claimed they gave it back which they did not, turns out they lost.

Being part of the Marina Bay Sands extravaganza, i knew it would be pricey, but i also knew it could be quite an unforgettable experience- and it did not disappoint!My friend and i had just been on a holiday through Germany and Switzerland over the Christmas and new year period, and had a few days in Singapore to thaw out and recover somewhat from our jet lag. Being the last night of our holiday, we wanted to do something memorable and a little bit fancy. After being recommended by friends that we ""must go to The Raffles and have a Singapore Sling"", and being slightly disappointed with the result, we decided to rely on our trusty Yelp app and see what else Singapore had to offer. Ku De Ta promptly popped up on the list,  i had heard about the views from the sky deck previously from a work colleague so flicked through some recent reviews. By booking in to the restaurant we didn't have to pay the usual $20 to get to the sky deck, so we went up early and had a drink at the sky bar. We were greeted quickly by multiple friendly staff, and very soon we were sipping on cocktails and taking in the view- and what a view it was! With 180 degree uninterrupted views across the city and the bay, i would've been quite happy to pay the $20 for the view alone. It really is fantastic.The staff at Ku De Ta are brilliant. They're attentive and friendly, and go out of their way to make you as comfortable as possible. The menu is designed in a way that you are inclined to order a bunch of smaller dishes to share, so that's what we did.We ordered about five dishes to share, and all of them were exceptional. The mushroom, the pork, the scallops- all perfectly cooked, the flavours were balanced and there were a nice combination of different textures too. The dishes were all plated with care, it was obvious the chef had thought of all aspects of the dining experience when creating the menu. I suppose the only downfall of the whole experience was the dessert- the flavours were surprisingly bland after such fresh and enjoyable combinations in the previous course; and yes, the wine and other alcoholic drinks we ordered with our meal and afterwards at the bar were really pricey. But, from what i could tell, alcohol anywhere in Singapore is pricey!All in all, it was an amazing experience, the views were phenomenal (especially once the sun set), the wait staff are friendly and attentive and the food although not the cheapest around, was delicious, well presented and creative. Would i go back next time i'm in Singapore? Absolutely! For a special last-night-out meal and a fantastic cocktail with the best view of the city- you can't get better than Ku De Ta! I'd probably skip the bottle of wine with dinner to save a couple of bucks next time though... ;-)"

This is actually the highlight of our trip so far.  We pre budgeted by looking at menu online beforehand and didn't order appetizer or drinks and paid $300 Singapore dollar. We had two entrees, a shared side, and the medium dessert sampler. Food was YUMMY!"

While you have your $16 beer or $30 wine you might enjoy the expansive views, while being elbowed by pushy tourists.  Look just one level down where more tourists are taking selfies, tired couples take their shoes off and rub their feet with backs propped up against the glass fence.  There were also a half dozen guests who had wandered over from the other side where the pool is, clad in bathrobes and slippers, armed with iPhone so everyone else will know where they've been.

Being part of the Marina Bay Sands extravaganza, i knew it would be pricey, but i also knew it could be quite an unforgettable experience- and it did not disappoint!My friend and i had just been on a holiday through Germany and Switzerland over the Christmas and new year period, and had a few days in Singapore to thaw out and recover somewhat from our jet lag. Being the last night of our holiday, we wanted to do something memorable and a little bit fancy. After being recommended by friends that we ""must go to The Raffles and have a Singapore Sling"", and being slightly disappointed with the result, we decided to rely on our trusty Yelp app and see what else Singapore had to offer. Ku De Ta promptly popped up on the list,  i had heard about the views from the sky deck previously from a work colleague so flicked through some recent reviews. By booking in to the restaurant we didn't have to pay the usual $20 to get to the sky deck, so we went up early and had a drink at the sky bar. We were greeted quickly by multiple friendly staff, and very soon we were sipping on cocktails and taking in the view- and what a view it was! With 180 degree uninterrupted views across the city and the bay, i would've been quite happy to pay the $20 for the view alone. It really is fantastic.The staff at Ku De Ta are brilliant. They're attentive and friendly, and go out of their way to make you as comfortable as possible. The menu is designed in a way that you are inclined to order a bunch of smaller dishes to share, so that's what we did.We ordered about five dishes to share, and all of them were exceptional. The mushroom, the pork, the scallops- all perfectly cooked, the flavours were balanced and there were a nice combination of different textures too. The dishes were all plated with care, it was obvious the chef had thought of all aspects of the dining experience when creating the menu. I suppose the only downfall of the whole experience was the dessert- the flavours were surprisingly bland after such fresh and enjoyable combinations in the previous course; and yes, the wine and other alcoholic drinks we ordered with our meal and afterwards at the bar were really pricey. But, from what i could tell, alcohol anywhere in Singapore is pricey!All in all, it was an amazing experience, the views were phenomenal (especially once the sun set), the wait staff are friendly and attentive and the food although not the cheapest around, was delicious, well presented and creative. Would i go back next time i'm in Singapore? Absolutely! For a special last-night-out meal and a fantastic cocktail with the best view of the city- you can't get better than Ku De Ta! I'd probably skip the bottle of wine with dinner to save a couple of bucks next time though... ;-)"

Our Sky Park experience ended with a noon cocktail. My mother had a rum-based orange drink while I had a vodka-based peach drink. I know it may sound weird, but surprisingly, it felt really good. The drinks were mixed well, we weren't able to taste that overwhelming alcohol. Just plain tropical refreshing goodness.

A lot of tourists do not realise that while it costs $20 to tour around the Skypark, it makes much more sense to instead get a drink or meal at KU DÉ TA, and with the receipt you can gain access to the Skypark as well. KU DÉ TA is separated into two sections, a restaurant with a Skybar, and a club lounge on the other side towards the swimming pool. KU DÉ TA restaurant is a modern Asian cuisine concept with a social dining aspect where we are encouraged to get a few dishes to share in the middle, which is a typically Asian tradition. My favourite dishes: the tempura yasai roll which was a beet and cream cheese sushi that was fried tempura-style, aburi salmon sashimi that had delicious salty miso notes, their signature crispy sticky baby squid and the seared yellowfin tuna steak which came with was separated into two: one with a lime seasoning and the other with a shishito pepper seasoning, with a huge blob of avocado sauce in the middle that was utterly delicious. However, the MUST-TRY is the desserts. Their signature Apple & Honey is not as simple as the name implies - it is a visual feast as well as a taste that was a sensory overload, which was surprisingly not overly sweet. A pleasant surprise was the Wasabi Ice Cream, which was really palatable and easy to eat even to some of my friends who usually do not take wasabi. Overall, the meal was not light on the wallet, but it was definitely in tune with their motto: 'A lifestyle less ordinary'."

To our surprise, the place was empty, and A Noodle Story went ahead and opened early I think because they felt bad for us. From there everything was peachy and our three dishes came out quickly. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$12.00 for any Hawker dish is boku expensive, but given the size and complexity of this dish it wasn't in my mind unreasonable. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?So, I really really love the concept of ramen style noodle dishes with little to no broth, and that's more or less exactly what this was with some great peripherals like shrimp wrapped in pan fried noodles and shrimp wontons. Having said that, the entire dish, especially the noodles, were very fishy, which for me is a pretty quick turn off. Even so good stuff and a dream for people who have different taste preferences from my own. Single Star.

It's definitely one of the more expensive stalls. A small is 9 dollars (12 for medium, 16 for large), but they do add special attention to detail. For example, they use the tweezers from fancy restaurants to place the scallions in your bowl and wipe the bowl's edge before serving (I had read the owner trained with chef Andre before).

High quality ingredients prepared well, yet at a relatively much lower price point (starts from $8) when compared to similarly quality ""ramens"". Where else can you find such a rare gem? It's no wonder the lines are out the door every single day. Al dente noodles, melt-in-your-mouth pork, perfectly marinated ramen-style eggs (hard whites, runny yolks), crispy wantons, full-flavoured umami-packed soup (only available if you dine at the hawker). Just take my $$$$. Yes, you can definitely find ordinary wanton noodles at more than half that price, but you get what you pay for. Some people complain about the lines and the high price for a ""hawker"" dish, but if you really consider the premium ingredients and time/effort taken to prepare every bowl, is $8 really too much? (The same argument goes for most other hawker dishes, actually. Why are people willing to pay more for ""cafe"" food,which often takes way less effort to prepare, at perhaps 3x the price with minimal complaints?)Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins during lunch time. Thinking of going later to avoid the queue? You may be disappointed, sometimes they close early as they run out of ingredients, learnt that the hard way :( So go early when they open (before lunch, or before dinner) to avoid disappointment. They have an express queue which comes at a premium of $2 per bowl. Well worth it if you're crunched for time but absolutely must try this. Pro-tip: if you're in the CBD area, Noodle Story is sometimes delivered on GrabFood under their ""Hawker"" initiative."

Came with a high expectation amid the fanfare generated by the Michelin announcement, and the plethora of cool pictures on Instagram.Ordered the jumbo plate and it was.... okay. Many people loved its concept of a Singapore-style ramen, but it was fusion-confusion for me. Personally, I found it pretty weird to be eating a wanton (Chinese dish) immediately after a cha-shu (Japanese dish), In entirety, the taste profiles of the ingredients just did not blend elegantly enough. In addition, I found the noodles too cluttered in a lump, making it tough to eat. Finally, the chilli looked cool, but tasted pretty dry.Nonetheless, I was deeply impressed by the quality of the ingredients, and that the owners decided not to cut corners despite the price point and hawker-food positioning. The potato wrapped prawn was also pretty incredible - crunchy and tasty. And yes, the bowl of noodle was full of cool ingredients that would make it very much Instagram-worthy.Does it deserve a Bib Gourmand? Probably not for me, although the owners are still pretty young and will only go up from there. I applaud their audacity to sort of reinvent the wheel, and I look forward to trying their dish again in a year."

My guess is that they don't use MSG, but unlike Japanese ramen shops, don't have enough ingredients that contribute their own umami.Of course, these are small grouses given the very reasonable price of $5.5-$7.5.

Between the restaurants and hawker stations the city knows how to eat. For my last night in the city my partner and I wanted to do something a little more upscale and nice with a pretty view and Empress did not disappoint. Beautiful decor and great service. We were staying at the Conrad in Suntec city and it was about a 15 minute pleasant walk. Set along the river Empress has both inside and outdoor seating areas that are tastefully decorated. The outdoor area commands a nice view of the strip of bars and restaurants across the river. It's also great to watch to watch the boats pass. Large menu with a variety of choices. Service was on point as well. We started with some appetizers; the meatless meatballs and I ordered the prawn wonton soup. Both were great though the wonton soup only had one large wonton. Our main dishes were beef with peppercorn and kung pao chicken. Both were great at as well and my kung pao certainly had a kick and a lot of chilis. Dessert was  good  as well I really enjoyed the pandan creme brûlée (also got the matcha dessert but realllyyyy like the creme brûlée.

Tri platter roast tops our expectation while the sweet sour soup was delicious, right amount of spicy and sour for Asian palate. The stir fried pork cooked right with texture soft and chewy. We like the mushrooms too. The scallop on asparagus is lightly fried and the sweetness comes thru with the first bite.

I think if they added some amazing sauce or just more sauce in general, it would've been really tasty. The lemon soda drink was quite refreshing. They gave us more syrup on the side but it was fine without it. My boyfriend messed up and added it towards the end and the drink ended up tasting like diabetes.

The seat was small and round, quite uncomfortable for me. To place order, just write down the items on the order list and give to the staff. Water was served here.cauliflower fritti, spicy mint aioli ($10++)Coated in a light batter, it was soft and mushy inside.angel hair pasta, sakura ebi, konbu, chilli ($27++)Smelt great like a well stir fried hokkien mee when served. The taste was umami, although there was some parts a tab more salty even after a good toss. Surprisingly the chilli taste was more distinct at the bottom of the dish.Potato gratin ($5++)Rich and creamy although I wished that the potato could have been more softer.Pear tart, crumble, baileys ice cream ($14++)Required a 20 minutes waitThe tart was very thin and crispy with lots of crumble on top.

This casual modern European restaurant with a touch of Asian flavors is helmed by Chef-Owner Sebastian Ng, former Chef-Owner of the now defunct Restaurant Ember, and Chef de Cuisine Jonathan Lee, former Head Chef of Artichoke.The sharing plates menu highlights some of Chef Sebastian's signatures from Ember across eight dish categories including, 'Toast', 'Fritti & Greens', 'Pasta', 'Raw, Cured & Smoked', 'Pan, Coal & Roast', 'Sides' and 'Sweets'.From the toast section, I enjoyed the toast with the foie gras mousse ($12) the most. Who doesn't like a creamy pate on fresh crunchy bread? The chopped seasonal mushrooms with truffle oil ($8) could have been given a creamier texture, or at least something to bind the finely chopped pieces. Or do what we did and the foie gras with the mushrooms before spreading it on the toast.Under the Fritti & Greens, highlights for us include the cauliflower fritti with spicy mint aioli ($10), grilled Spanish gem lettuce with burrata and mentaiko vinaigrette ($19) and the lovely seasonal Jerusalem artichoke soup with crispy duck ($8). Cauliflowers are such great snacks and i swear you wouldn't be able to stop popping these crunchy bites of florets that have been lightly coated and deep-fried.As much as I love my raw and cold salads, the grilled version of the Spanish gem lettuce fared better than the cold one, which was bland in comparison even with the anchovy sauce. For $9, I'd rather get a salad elsewhere.Head over for dinner and you'll be able to dig into Venue's gorgeous angel hair pastas. While the idea/flavor isn't anything innovative, Venue by Sebastian outshines the rest by providing stellar rendition of the dish. The perfectly al dente noodles were cooked in various styles here. Love a creamy one? The konbu and truffle oil ($23) was smooth and silky and we loved how the noodles were coated in the umami sauce.The sakura ebi with konbu and chili ($27) version provides diners with a crunchier bite with its dry stir-fry noodle style of preparation. The fragrance is simply intoxicating.For punchier and meatier carb dish, the hand-cut pappardelle with a comforting tomato-base duck ragout ($21) is accentuated with the sharp Parmigiano Reggiano.I know there's a tendency to skip chicken but the wood-grilled Chermoula chicken with lemon ($15/leg) is one of the best chicken dish i've had this year (the other being the twice-cooked chicken roulade at SPRMRKT). This succulent leg of chicken has been marinated in their house-made chermoula for two days and slow-grilled for at least 40 minutes over wood fire for an intense smoky flavor. Plus that paper thin crispy skin!!Former regulars who were familiar with Chef Sebastian's Chilean sea bass with mushroom and bacon ragout and truffle yuzu butter sauce ($36) will be pleased to find this dish on the menu as well. Delightful plate with a refreshing cream sauce.The grilled octopus with bean purée, capers and burnt butter ($27) is another noteworthy seafood dish. The Australian-sourced octopus is cooked to a perfect tender texture and served alongside a creamy white bean purée and some savory capers to top. The portion is really small though.The portion size of the Iberico pork jowl with gremolata and lemon ($18) is also not suitable for sharing IMO. I'm sure you'd want more of these tender slices.In comparison, the Chef Sebastian's signature Duck confit ($19) provides more value for money in terms of filling your tummy. However, the dish was unmemorable.For desserts, i adore the pear tart with baileys ice cream ($14). The filo pastry tart base is absolutely crispy and the crumble added a lovely crunch to each bite. The apple ""pie"" with rum and raisin ice cream ($14) is also delightful but there's more moisture due to the apple filling.An interesting spa-like dessert is the spiced panna cotta with blood orange sorbet ($12). Well it tastes like aromatherapy+lemon dishwasher but Jr likes it. Well.. try it for yourself!Head over to Venue by Sebastian with a group of friends in order to tackle the extensive menu! The lunch menu features a condensed selection of the dinner menu, whilst a special Bodega Hour menu serving bar snacks and attractively-priced beer and wine from 5.30 to 6.30pm will be launching soon."

Their foods are clean, the atmosphere is nice and the price is reasonable. Let's talk about Soup first. There are varieties of soup to choose and my personal favorite is Spicy soup. According to my wife, the chicken is also very delicious. I recommend trying spicy soup if you do not have a problem with spiciness as they are pretty strong. Secondly, the meats and other ingredients such as meatballs, vegetables are fresh and cut in good size. We ordered a set for 2 pax. It comes with 2 soups, 2 type of meats (pork and beef), assorted meatballs, and vegetables. There are others set meals with different ingredients. Moreover, set meal is not very expensive. Highly recommended. Don't forget to reserve as they are giving 20% off for who makes a reservation."

We came in without a reservation (my husband called for their hours but did not realize we needed a reservation) and was seated at the bar. This hot pot place gives each person their own hot pot station. We ordered the couple's set A which includes Wagyu beef, pork shoulder slices, fish paste, vegetables (mushrooms and lettuces), and fish balls. We added an order of Wagyu prime rib slices as well. We are able to choose the broth and stable. I picked udon for my stable and wanted the double broth pan for tom yum broth and chicken broth. My husband picked rice vermicelli for his stable and fish milk broth and herbal broth.We both enjoyed what we had ordered. Everything came out at a decent pace.Unexpected happening: so another couple came in with a reservation and was seated at the bar but closer to the kitchen. The wife started yelling at the female server that she don't want to be pushed around by them because they seated her near the kitchen. That wife was so angry and kept scolding that one server and eventually they were moved next to my husband, yet she still yelled. The whole restaurant just watched and whisper to each other. Then she was moved once again because she didn't like the bar seating and was complaining over and over. I have never seen such rude customers at a nice hot pot like this. So when that server pass by I asked if she's okay. She patted me on the shoulder and said it's okay.After we almost finished our meal that same server asked if we would like any drink. We didn't order any drink because we had a water bottle with us. The server liked me from my gesture earlier and she wanted to treat us, but we kindly said it's okay. We went to pay and usually they have a fee for those who does not have a reservation, but they waved it for us!! Instead of paying $90+, we paid $76. :)I definitely enjoyed my dinner here that night."

Located at level 33, the casual gastro-bar provided an unparalleled view of the Marina Bay area. Food wise, there's more than just bar bites. The menu here has a mix of South-East Asia flavors and hearty (for lack of a better description) Western food. The best time to visit? FRIDAYS. House pour wines and beers are only $10 and cocktails are priced at $12 nett! You can also get bottles from $88. Plus, the live band gets the party going from 6pm.Always order the Whipped Buffalo Milk Ricotta ($15) to start. The winning combination of smooth airy cream with an earthy truffle honey on warm crusty chewy bread dissolved our resolve to save space for the other dishes.We were surprised by an entire head of Roasted Broccoli ($14) with a fiery honey Dijon and Sriracha dressing and pops of acidity from the sweet pickles, chili and lemon. Chop the florets up and toss them in the Korean style sweet and spicy sauce. How's this for an interesting bar bite?Skewers are perfect pairings for ice cold beers and it was #TB to the back alleys of Saigon with the Vietnamese Charcoal Grilled Pork Sausage ($16). The meat though flavored, could do with punchier aromatics. Meat lovers would love the options at Cook & Brew. The USDA 365 day 340gm grain-fed striploin ($61) was red and juicy, just the way we like it. The smoked cipollini jus provided a lovely caramel flavor to the mix and the crispy smashed potatoes were lovely starchy morsels.If you like even punchier flavors, the Beef Pot Roast ($39) certainly makes the cut. The USDA beef short ribs are easily pulled apart with a spoon and i loved how the creamy goat cheese and mascarpone polenta helps to balance the savory gravy of the meat.The pastas took us by surprise at Cook & Brew! The quality is that of a specialty Italian restaurant's. The Garganelli Pasta & Duck Confit ($32) uses a double-boiled duck broth and a dry Riesling for its umami base. The Handmade Ricotta Cavatelli ($28) was our favorite pasta dish. The fluffy pillows were coated with an aromatic Coriander rocket pesto and topped with some cashew nuts, pecorino cheese and complemented with some sweet roasted pumpkin. Plus what's perfect is that it's also vegetarian. About the Lobster Grilled Cheese ($49) which features Nova Scotia lobster, let's say that this is not the best  and I wouldn't order it despite the delicious fried brioche. The one dimensional grilled cheese  and the lack of a creamy sauce-marinate for the lobster made this a rather dry meal. Perhaps a bowl of that Grandma's tomato jam may help a little. Dessert isn't a strong suit of Cook & Brew. The Strawberry Basil & Rhubarb cake ($15) was dry and forgettable. The concept is great but the execution poor. The Chocolate Raspberry and Hazelnut Crunch ($15) fared better but well one shouldn't mess up a chocolate dish. Have this flourless chocolate cake if you must have desserts. Or simply do another round of that whipped ricotta with truffle honey. Will certainly be back for at Cook & Brew for Friday drinks and more pastas! Just use your dessert stomach for more food here."

The bar offers an extensive selection of fine wines and craft beers from around the world. There is both indoor and outdoor dining area, surrounding with comforty seats around with flat screen television, showing sport channel. Most enjoy dining in the outdoor with the cool wind blowing and a nice view of the busy port.HEIRLOOM TOMATOES & PLUMS ($17)Buttermilk and gorgonzola cheese dressing, butter curd, pecan brittleBest enjoyed with La Chouffe beerThe strong taste of the butter curd was strangely balanced by the sweet honeyed pecan brittle. It quite peaked up one's appetite.WHIPPED BUFFALO MILK RICOTTA ($12)Truffle honey, grilled breadBest enjoyed with Peroni Nastro Azzurro beerThe bread was soft and buttery, having been drizzled with olive oil. Spread on with slightly sweet and milky spread, it offered another taste on the simple bread.POLENTA & DUTCH VEAL BRISKET ($42)Milk braised veal breast, kale, glazed turnipsBest enjoyed with BrewDog Hardcore BeerThe veal was very tender and juicy, accompanied by the milky creamy polenta and the crunchy turnips.THE MONTREAL BURGER ($34)Packs a punch with its copious amounts of house-smoked Montreal meat, made by curing beef brisket with cracked peppercorns, coriander, garlic and mustard seed over 21 days, beef patty and red onions, served with fries with Rosemary and shaved Parmesan, and Canadian mustard.Best enjoyed with Borealis Rare Iceberg BeerThis burger was the chef's signature, but I could tell that it is a meat lover's dream with so much meat in it. As for me, I preferred the fries which I felt was better than the fries that served with the two other burgers. The fries was lightly flavoured with rosemary and topped with shaved paramesan. It smelt nice and more appetizing in taste.BROCCOLI & BACON CHEESE BURGER ($29)A treat robust flavours; beef patty topped with creamed broccoli, double thick house-smoked maple-glazed bacon and American cheddar.Best enjoyed with Grolsch BeerNever had a burger with creamed broccoli. I felt that it made the burger less dry and easier to eat, when comparing to the other two burgers.HAWKER BURGER ($32)Well-marinated char siew-style pork jowl that is sweet, slightly moist on the inside and charred on the outside, crispy pork belly, served atop a juicy beef patty, served with sambal mayonnaise, sliced green pickled chillies, and fries tossed in chilli.Best enjoyed with Tiger BeerIt was my first time of having a burger served with pickled chilli. The burger was the chef's version of localized burger. It was quite a combination in the mouth with fatty pork belly, the slightly sweet char siew, and the spicy mayonnaise spread on the bun. Interesting explosive flavours.Rum and Raisin ice creamServed with oreo crumblesA simple but delightful finish to a heavy meal.Hot Chocolate ($8)A well made drink although I wished that it could be richer in taste.Overall the food was huge in serving and tasted great, although my jaws felt tired after all the chewing of the burger. The place was relaxing and quiet, with nice view outside. Service was fast and efficient."

We celebrated this weekend by looking for turkey. Been frequenting Cook & Brew, the gastro-bar at the top of The Westin Singapore. There are some outstanding dishes and some hits (more) and misses (less) but what drew me back was their version of poutine. That's the only reason needed to visit this place. They have a pulled pork, gravy & cheese version that is wonderful.So we sought out poutine, which is quintesentially Canadian, as our anchor for giving thanks. Turns out there's way more to the menu that we first thought. The ExecChef, Aaron Foster, is Canadian! He put together modern interpretations of classic bar dishes as well as local food. The atmosphere is modern, uptempo'd tracks in the background, and great for drinks and snacks as well they stay open til late. Unfortunately, no turkey so we went with turkey balls! Meatballs, that is. Not a big fan of meatballs and these were pretty big. Served with a tomato sauce.  Another dished called 'fancy fish & chips' had beer battered Nova Scotia lobster. Since this was an all Canadian affair, decided to order that as well. $46 is a bit pricey in my opinion, but you're shipping these lobsters from the Atlantic! Unfortunately, lobster is best served without being battered. It is a waste of a lovely ingredient as the richness and flavor is lost in the coating. Been there, done it.We had the previously mentioned poutine which is a full plate by itself. This pared with the wild arugula salad is all the food groups you need. =)For dessert we tried the smoked bacon caramel chocolate bar. You need to have a serious sugar tooth for this dish as it is very heavy and rich. The hazelnut, while plentiful was soft. Topped with a piece of smoked bacon that could've used a bit more crispness. I could only take a piece and then stopped. Again been there, done it. Stick with the Bailey's cake. It is topped with whiskey and coffee ice cream. So I have a reserved recommendation. I'm going back and trying dishes until I find the tried and true. It is a 3.5star if I could give it."

I think we know the drill with these joints so I'll just note down the surprising elements:- Very classy, mod ""cigar room"" feel to the decor. The furniture in the bar area is set up to be like a lounge so much so that there's actually too much empty space! I never thought I'd say that in Singapore but going by the groups of people standing in bits and bobs around the room because they couldn't a table (not even a standing one), I think C&B could make a lot more money by filling up said space.- The view, though slightly blocked by the high terrace walls, is stunning. 1-Alt, Zaff, Lvl 33 and KDT, make some room...- There's something very relaxing about sitting outdoors, cold pint in hand, watching ships parked on the bay. It's so breezy that even though I was surrounded by smokers (gross), I didn't get smoked out.- Fried calamari is very, very good. Sea salt, fried crisp, skip the dip. Same can't be said about the fried soft shell crab with wedges = fail pub grub.- There's a pretty energetic vibe indoors, with a little bit of the hey who's at the next table air but not too much to be pretentious. Then again, that could be me with slight beer goggles on the way to the bathroom. Oh and I think they serve free finger food inside.Not so important and maybe negative bits:- Cocktails are weak as heck. Friend had a whiskey sour that tasted like lemonade (??)- Usual CBD prices and given that alcohol tax is going to be 25% higher, doesn't make this joint any easier on the wallet. I did find the beer selection affordable and diverse and will stick to that. I attended a work related event here 2 month's ago, which means this is on the sell side radar/price point (see my review of Lucho Luca for what this entails).- If you come early, you can get a seat without much fuss. They also take reservations. However, if you just roll on in  with everyone else craving a beer at 7pm, it gets full really quick and we saw people literally standing in little circles with their bags on the shoulder/floor. I would just turn round, head downstairs to one of the other bars.To conclude, refreshing new bar in the vicinity. Would come by again but not shouting over the rooftops about it. They should hire a new cocktail dude pronto. Oh and the servers, though a little stressed at times, were quite on the ball and efficient. Props!"

I was initially skeptical as the place was quite empty upon arrival, but that soon changed when the dishes arrived. A full Izakaya at night, ShuKuu serves a limited range of rice bowls for lunch. These are very reasonably priced ($12-$17).I had the kushi don, which came with 5 different sticks of kushiyaki, an onsen egg, rice, pickles and soup. I must say, I wasn't expecting both the quality and the quantity at lunch prices.The rice was soft and fluffy, and had the sweetness I've come to associate with high quality Japanese rice. The kushiyaki were all nicely salted and charred - meats were tender but not dry."

There has been a number of japanese restaurants opening around the area so it's easy to miss this one. We went there around 5 pm and the street is deserted, which actually added some charm to this quiet back street that people usually ignore. We took the outdoor seating area, which is basically a row of street-side barrels with a table top. Since it's an izakaya, we decided to go for some sake and asked for recommendations from the waiter, who was very helpful and patient in explaining the drinks menu to us. Since we have a large group, he also helped pick a bunch of snacks to accompany our drinks. He noted down our dietary preferences and soon we were presented with plates after plates of delicious japanese tapas style snacks.  We had raw squid (raw and grilled), fried octopus, dried grilled sting ray and vegetable sticks dipped in miso. Everything was delicious and fresh, we ended up ordering another round of sake and snacks.  It's a place where you can just hang out for hours with your buddies while nibbling on yummy snacks.  Service is really friendly and efficient so I am delighted to have discovered this place.I noticed that they are pretty popular during lunch and seem to offer some lunch sets but haven't had a chance to try.  If you work in the area, I definitely recommend checking this out for after-work drinks, it's a good alternative to the glitzy rooftop and bayside bars on the Raffles Place side with a more local neighborhood taste."

The star dish that stood out to me was the beef gyu don. The Beef gyu don was well prepared where  the blend of the rice and well cooked beef reminds me of the beef dons I ate when I spent my time in Japan. The ponzu beef was an excellent dish in terms of how the meat texture and taste was, combining the tenderly cooked beef with a lovely smoked flavour that mixed well with the sauce.The oyster was fresh and delicious, though the sauce did not mix as much, overall very well cooked and delicious and something that would be worth ordering again"

I personally prefer my sake with seafood - deep fried sakura shrimp! The main reason is because the deep fried shrimps are one of the dishes that I could use my hands to pick it up - makes me feel like I am at home :) Although the chicken gizzards was not exactly our kind of dish, we were glad we tried. it paired well with our sake and even though we were not fans of gizzards, the well-marinated dish did not disappoint at all.overall, would recommend this place to wind down after a day's work. the tapas-like food and grilled skewers are value for money and affordable. alternatively, there are also udons and don that could fill one's stomach up!"

Unlike the Paragon outlet where you get someone else's what seem like overnight duck drenched in some unidentifiable salty sauce. The Peking duck is also tastier at this outlet.

Let's go into the nuts and bolts of it:The good: Really good pu-er tea (not your typical Crystal Jade chinese tea experience), which was amazingly still fragrant on the 2nd refill. The dumplings (""ha kau"" and ""siew mai"") were delicious. Not overly heavy on the meats in these but sufficient to be succulent without feeling too greasy. The char siew bao / pork bun was also really good - the meat was sufficiently fatty, which is becoming a rarity in health-conscious Singapore. Service was also impeccable, they were pretty much stealthy ninjas who refilled your teapot while you were conversing.The bad: The shrimp/prawn roll (""cheong fun"") was really quite disappointing, way too many layers wrapping the prawns, so it doesn't absorb the soy sauce sufficiently to create a balance of flavours. Steamed carrot cake was also a little too tough and bland for my preference - I really prefer it when the texture is softer with more flavour (I'm thinking of the one at Wah Lok@Carlton Hotel as an example). The latter might be more a personal thing, though.I really wanted to give this place 4* but when you trot out $5 or so per plate of dim sum, the expectations do go up and it's a shame. It's not a bad experience - I would give this place another try because there's so much going for it, but definitely avoiding those 2 dishes if I do return for lunch."

There was so much flavour packed into these little bite sized tacos, I'm still craving them a day later. Potatoes Bravos: Delicious and delicate. A perfect starter that will not fill you up, but will make you anxiously await your next plate.Grilled Octopus: wow. All I can say is wow. Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, with a perfect char. I've had quite a bit of octopus and this rivals the best I've had. French Toast and Ice Cream dessert: How can you go wrong with this, it's a perfectly sweet dessert that isn't too sweet and not too heavy. A great way to finish a great meal.

I hate that they do two sittings, one at 6:30pm and the other at like... 9. It's ridiculous. Some of us work till 7 ish, 8, and there's no way we can wait till 9 to have dinner. So the only time I've eaten at FOC is for a work dinner, when the entire office got off work early, just so we could eat here. Other than with such special arrangements? I'm basically never going to be able to dine here on a weekday.The food was... good. Not mind-blowing. Not amazing. Just... good. And not even enthusiastically good. Granted, I didn't order items off the menu, we had a pre-ordered selection of the menu because we were such a big group, but I think we hit many of the popular items. The octopus was good, but not the best, or second best I've had in Singapore. The eggs scrambled at the table with fried potatoes, brilliant idea, but the hot-plate wasn't hot enough to actually cook the eggs, so we had very raw egg white, slightly cooked egg-yolk, and brilliantly crisp potato bits. The watermelon gazpacho was tasty and very addictive, and I'd definitely order it again... if I do go back. The seafood paella was popular with some, though the seafood taste got a bit overpowering by the 4-5 spoonful. Mushroom croquettas? Brilliant. Creamy, practically fall apart croquettas with a strong distinct mushroom taste. Really good. But better than a good creamy jamon croquetta? Unfortunately... no.So maybe you'll enjoy FOC more than I did if you're a fan of cocktails. I didn't order any because I was driving, and was having wine. But right now, I'd rather head to UNA for my tapas fix."

From Michelin-starred restaurants (which I'm not sure is the best way to assess the more traditional dishes, but then again this region was under French protection at one point ) to a home kitchen, the food in Catalunya is fantastic. If food was reason alone for granting autonomy, I say why not! Anyway, let's leave the politics aside and talk about FOC. I didn't visit Can Jubany in Osona but I bet FOC is equally good. Spanish food by the Spanish, not too pricey and portions were sufficient (here's looking at you, Serenity). I was craving some fideuà, which is like the ang moh version of hokkien prawn mee...and the chef gamely obliged with his rendition of squid ink fideuà. It was very tasty with a good amount of wok hei! We also had the croquettes, which had mashed potatoes so mashed it was practically a mouth-watering puree; sardines with pickles 9gives your palate a good puckering up), fresh and very sweet tomatoes, the potatas bravas (kinda skimpy on the seasoning and not greasy...which I kind of associate with the dish but hey this will do) and the battered cod fish balls with apple puree (interesting but kind of mushy with not too distinctive flavors i.e. I couldn't tell it was cod). Up to this point, the food came out at a steady pace and then we had a long wait. I checked on the waiter and realized the kitchen had forgotten our grilled octopus and the egg with pork belly and truffle special...while the clock was ticking on when we had to vacate our seats because of the two cover policy and because I had a show to catch at the Art House. The octopus was served shortly and much as I had hyped up my dining partner on the wonders of Spanish octopuses (they are in fact ridiculously taught, smoky, crisp and mind blowing), the FOC version kind of disappointed. Time in the Josper grill somehow robbed the octopus of its juices, though I liked the char on top, so this was an ""ehhh"" dish that could've been so much better. The eggs with pork belly and truffles (what a combo right) never came and I think I actually paid for it in my haste. I didn't check the bill thoroughly but on hindsight at $180 and some quick math off the website, I think I was charged for the dish that never went into my belly even though I would've loved to taste it.Finally a note on the cocktails. I had the cuzco sour...because if you've hiked all over Peru you would have romantic memories of this lovely drink (not so much of the chicha). It was very balanced - the right amount of tart lime/lemon and the requisite egg whites and bitters on top. My second drink was a Bangkok something, which I asked the waiter to recommend based on my preference for something ""refreshing"". It ended up being almost exactly the same as the sour except for some supposed chilli's that were mild to non-existent. Maybe I'm being a little picky but the mark of front of house would be one that watches both your food and drink selections and offers pairings that work with the food or takes you in a different direction from your first. I felt the team fell short here though it's not surprising given how busy the restaurant was.Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal at FOC, probably because the food and drinks came soon enough that I was willing to over look the slow service towards the end and the incorrect billing."

The staff knew the menu inside-out, so they were able to make spot-on recommendations; the arrival of our courses were timely; and our water glasses were kept topped up with big smiles.As for the Catalan food at FOC, it was indeed superb - traditional but executed with an effortless flair so while dishes seldom deviate from the classics, flavours are rich, hearty and soulful. It's pricey, but no more expensive than any other Spanish restaurants aroundWe had:1) Heuvos Estrellados con Chorizo ($10) - a breakfast hash of fried potatoes, chorizo balls and a just-cracked egg, still sizzling on the hotplate: Smoosh it all together, and you get a glorious mess of runny eggy delight. Our favourite tapas here.2) Croquetas de Setas con Jamon ($10 for 4): a mixed platter of mushroom croquettes and Spanish ham croquettes, bursting with creamy goodness, and tempered with the contrast of the soft mash and crunchy breadcrumbed coat.3) Tortilla Abierta con Trufa y Pimientos del Piquillo ($26): an open tortilla with blistered red peppers, truffle strips and aioli was simple but done fantastically. It was just the right balance of rich aioli, aromatic truffle, sweet peppers and eggy pancake.4) Gambas al Ajillo ($18): a classic of sauteed prawns in white wine and garlic, notable for 2 things: the copious use of really good white wine, which made this the most heady rendition ever - I think I got a little high from this; and incredibly sweet prawns still with shells on, for maximum flavour infusion to the sauce. A tip: get bread to mop all the deliciousness up.5) Vieiras a la Brasa con Caldo de Bonito y Caviar de Soja ($16): a couple of fat succulent scallops grilled to a beautiful caramelization, and dunked into a delicate bonito stock and topped with soy beads. Great fusion of Asian flavours6) Costillas de Cerdo a la Brasa con Pure de Calabaza Ahumada ($30): seriously good, premium iberico pork ribs, burnished with rosemary, were grilled to a juicy smoky finish, and sided by a smoked pumpkin puree.7) Arroz Negro con Mariscos y ""All I Oli"" ($24): perhaps the best squid ink paella I've ever had. The moreish squid ink was nuanced and countered with the creamy bite of aioli. You can't quite see it, but there was as much rice as there was squid dice, so that's really amazingly generous."

Where do I start? First of all - its a good idea to reserve a table or seats. Depending if you are interested to see how they make the food or if you just want to sit and relax with your friends. The decor is cool - reminds me of the cool kid clubs in Berlin - and the service awesome. The food: You might want to go for exercise before you enter the sinful temple of culinary highlights - as you will most likely eat more than usual because its just so good. Usually I sit at the bar and let the boss decide what he is going to serve me as so far - he never disappointed. From the gazpacho to the clams over the chorizo to the creme catalan (which is a MUST HAVE!!) everything is just amazing. I have been to Barcelona and never had such amazing tapas. The way the food is combined - the flavours, the consistency and structure is very different, surprising and every time like a food symphony.  What I personally like is that the way the spices are used is so balanced that I don't need to put on extra salt or any other sauce. For me that means that a dish is perfect and that is extraordinary. Drinks: Their wine and beer selection is quite good but I normally stick to my two favourite cocktails: Old Fashion Churchill and Bloody Jordy (which - if you like body mary - is a MUST HAVE TOO!!). Last but not least - I went there once with a colleague who is vegetarian - and even for him there was a lot of choice and he really enjoyed the food too. I will keep coming back.

I'm used to lasagna having tomato sauce within the layers, but the sauce with these lasagna is more of a cheesy cream sauce. Good, but heavy.Pizzas -Smoked salmon pizza was delish. The veggie was okay, but the veggies seemed a bit off (over cooked? dried out? just been sitting out all day?). The mushroom pizza was fab, but I'm also a big mushroom fan so others may not agree.In the deli case the broccoli had a bit too much oil (must have been a heavily oily stir fry), and wasn't at all spicy (though labeled ""spicy broccoli"").

Anyway, my work people rave about GT all day every day, so I thought let me go see what all the fuss is about.  I ordered the upstream which was really really good.  The dressing was the real star, and although when you look at the amount of food you are getting, you start to panic, but you'll be full.  I promise.  You can also make your own salad, or bowl, or whatever, but they have some pretty good ones already put together.  The second one I tried had chicken, and more of a Mexican feel, but the upsteam was def. better.  For a meal, snack and water will run you $16.  Not cheap, but def. worth it.  I saw they also do breakfast, and have some interesting stuff going on, so looking forward to go when I have a free minute to spare in the AM.  Perfect for those who work in the CBD and need a quick, healthy lunch, or live in the area and need something after a work out, or on the way home from a late night at the office."

BUT EXPENSIVE! I really don't understand. Does eating lunch in CBD has to be this expensive? I know there are bankers and lawyers but there are also underpaid consultants (aka me) and also others who earn a decent salary for a living. I call this pure indulgent eating here, and can only do it once a while.  That being said, Grain Traders serves really good, fresh food. I enjoyed my food here tremendously. It definitely reminds of the fuss- free, health-conscious restaurants you get in Australia or the US. The concept is the same like The Daily Cut, you can either order set meal called ""Hero Bowls"" or DIY your own lunch. Same price at $16 nett. Hero Bowls section comes in 6 choices but since I was hangry (read: hungry + angry), i head straight to the DIY section. For the price you get to choose: 1 grain (quinoa, brown rice, japanese rice, or soba)1 protein (beef, salmon or chicken)1 hot vege (various items to choose from)2 cold vege (various salads, kimchis etc)1 topping (no, im not talking about rainbow sprinkles or m&ms here)1 sauce (you MUST MUST try the MISO CARAMEL sauce!!)........................and you get a bowl of wholesome meal. There;s also a coffee bar on the other side of the restaurant that serves decent coffee at the price you get from 'bucks. I got myself a cup of latte and it was pretty good, at $5.50. I spent a total of $21.50 of lunch today, which is equivalent to almost 3 plates of normal mixed rice from the hawker center. Will i come back, yes. Maybe once every fortnight. Or else I might have to get a bank loan to eat here daily. Lunch crowd (12-1pm) tends to get overwhelming so come really early or late to avoid the madness. Service is prompt and efficient overall! p/s: The miso caramel sauce is as good as the maple butter syrup from clinton st bakery. I can drink it on its own, I swear"

They give you two 2-3"" circular pieces of grilled polenta with greens, beans, and avocado. For oatmeal, it's a big hearty scoop with delicious toppings. Oatmeal's a little bit on the sweeter side but what I loved about it was how sticky it was. Both are $8 SGD which is a little bit pricey but totally worth it. For lunch, I usually make my own bowl. I've had their tuna, salmon, and chicken as protein with toppings such as apple kimchi, beans, and roasted veggies. For dressing, their beetroot feta yogurt, wasabi, and coconut curry were my favorites. All the ingredients are super fresh. I also love their concept- it's healthy with unique flavors! The only thing I wished they offered was giving the option of doing half greens and grains for the base (you can only get salad only or noodles/rice only).Service is super quick (even during peak hours) as it is in the hustle and bustle area of CBD. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in Singapore who is looking for something healthy and hearty!"

Only $10 and you get: a bagel, a protein, a spread, a veggie, and something extra. I always get their plain bagels toasted (they only have 2 types of bagels unfortunately), with jalapeno cream cheese, cured salmon, avocado, and spinach. ALL THAT FOR JUST $10! Great deal!

Everything I chose tasted great: the charred corn, striploin steak, pickled capsicums, and the bean pico de gallo. Additionally you can choose a sauce, and that in itself took me a while because there was a lot and I wanted to try so many!Depending on what you get it could be $15-20.

I saw a few Toast Box locations during our stay so it seems like this is a popular fast casual chain. I ordered the traditional Kaya toast set which comes with the soft boiled eggs and a drink, so I chose the Teh C. It tasted just like a hot milk tea, so tasty! The service was meh. They didn't have the slightest smile or bit of friendliness in them and they didn't care that we have never ordered here before or even had ""kopi"" or ""teh"" Singaporean style. They just pointed to a sign on the register that had a graphic of what each Kopi or Teh A, B, and C consisted of. They don't have signs on how exactly to eat the toast and soft boiled eggs but luckily I was prepared. I knew Kaya toast was a popular dish so I looked up videos beforehand! So for all the fellow rookies out there... first, crack your soft boiled eggs into the empty dish they give you. Add a drizzle of soy sauce and salt, you can add more later to your liking. Mix it all up together with a spoon. Dip your toast into this egg mixture, and enjoy! The Kaya jam was so yummy. And if you really like it, you can grab a jar at the counter to take home for later. My husband's ham and cheese toast was also yummy, and much thicker bread, but we both preferred the Kaya toast more."

I'm not a huge proponent for local food - it's usually a little too heavy on the carb and grease; but I do enjoy the simpler things, like dipping toast into a half-boiled eggs darkened with a dash of soy. and while the prices here may be higher than at your neighborhood joint, there's something to be said about clean tables and surroundings, and much to be said for air-conditioning in singapore's unforgiving heat.we ended up here after a trip to the gardens by the bay - second choice after seeing din tai fung's infernal queue - and had a filling meal: eggs and plain thick toast (the thicker, the better) for me, nasi lemak (coconut rice served with a fried chicken wing, egg and fried anchovies) as well as a bowl of mee rebus (yellow noodles in a creamy curry-type gravy).cheap, decent, filling food - arguably the best value in this extravagant mall. and a great introduction to local food, if you're so inclined."

I find it hard to pay ten bucks for a very average taco when it's ten times cheaper and ten times better in the US. That being said this is one of the better places in Singapore if you do have a Mexican food craving. Their lunch combo though expensive is good value for money by Singapore standards. 30$ pp gets you an appetizer a main course and an option between dessert and coffee.

Go only if you want to be by the bay. And I don't even say if you want a nice fancy Mexican dinner, because the music was too loud both from the restaurant itself and the Esplanade concert hall on the other end of the bay (we could feel the bass from where we were). For actually good Mexican with a much nicer ambience (although not by a water body), I recommend El Mero Mero at CHIJMES, with the Entertainer app if you have it. For much better Mexican food in a cute small family-owned place at much better prices (but not easily accessible), go to Belmonte Latin Foods, which is 1/3 the price and has much better food. For a hip and more accessible (financially and transportationally) place head to Muchachos.De Pescado Fish taco ($11) - 1.5 starsThis wasn't even average. It was downright bad. The fish was dry and overcooked. And I've had real fish tacos in Mexico and Southern California so I know they're not meant to be like this!De Camarones Prawn taco ($13) - 2.5 starsThe prawns weren't fishy thankfully, but they also lacked any distinct flavour. A very unmemorable dish.Costilla De Res Beef quesadilla ($18) - 3 starsThis was the best of the lot, thanks to the flavour, but the texture of the beef was dry and overcooked. My dad would hate it.Not to mention, all the portions were terribly small. The prices for the tacos are per taco. We were still hungry by the end, but the food disappointed and we figured we'd rather head elsewhere.Ambience - 2 starsThis is what we were most disappointed by, given that I figured half of what I'm paying for is going towards their rental cost. Our outdoor table for two was seated such that my plus one had no view of the bay, just of the inside of the restaurant. We improvised and shifted the chair over at the end of the meal so that we both faced the water, a la a Parisian cafe.There were loudspeakers overhead that were blaring music, and on a Friday night there must have been a concert (sounded more like a horror show somehow) at the outdoor amphitheater at the Esplanade. As mentioned, we could actually feel the bass coming from over there! My plus one did not enjoy it at all and we agreed we probably wouldn't come back, mostly because of the poor ambience."

Their calamansi margarita is one of my favourites too.Although their food itself is nothing amazing. It's probably on the better side for the mexican food you find in Singapore be it's still not authentic or flavourful enough for me to want to come back -- especially as a vegetarian. Their enchiladas are decent but aren't as addictive as I would've liked but their quesadilla is good.

They could use a little more toppings outside the quesadilla, whether it be more fruit salsa or another in the mix.

Obviously not all of their menu is authentic Mexican; they do have a lot of tacos and dishes which are a fusion of Mexican with Korean and other styles.

Opened about a month ago, Vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and/or drinks. The margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer/cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass. As for the food, for me it's not something new and exciting. Roy Choi started the whole Korean taco theme in Los Angeles circa 2008, and it's been duplicated around the world. I'm still looking for ""the"" place in SG that serves up the Tex-Mex/Cali-Mex versions that my palate is familiar with. Don't get me wrong, Vatos is a great choice for asian-influenced Mexican street food. The tacos were, how do I put it? ... tasty but unsubstantial. Maybe I'm jaded by being from California, but ~$12++ for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey. The homemade tortillas were good but a little thin. The flavors were a mash-up of Mexican and Korean, which I enjoyed. The Kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty. Don't know if the fries were salted, hopefully not, because the kimchi, cheese, and carnitas were already sodium loaded. Would come back again because there are things on the menu I still want to try. Mucho gusto."

I will admit, the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but I thought I'd give it a shot. While I really wanted this to be good, there were several  negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum. So if you're a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos, you're out of luck. It's only  3 of one type or  4 of two types, etc   No big deal if you're dining with friends, but cut me some slack. I'm a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you  wouldn't do it even with a  polite request to make an exception. So I ordered 3 pork barbecoa and they were delicious.  So delicious, I was wishing I could have tried some others. The ""Cowboy Queso"" on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it's as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl. So we're batting 50 50 on food quality.Then there's the service. Kind of disinterested and bothered would he how I would describe it. Ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed. My server never showed again either and I had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go.It's a pretty nice place and the one taco I tried was delicious, but beyond that, there's not much to recommend here and given the negatives, I'm not sure I would come back.

Vatos Tacos is a delightful Mexican/Korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles (sorry, couldn't help myself) and rice you'll consume whilst in Singapore. ""Chips"" (more accurately, tortillas) and salsa are complimentary with your visit. What I Got and What I Thought:1. Chimichurri Chicken Urban Taco     DELICIOUS. Would absolutely have this again. The chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the ""spicy"" chicken. While it did have a nice kick to it, I finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips. As long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden. If you're interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it, but you're worried about spice, just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for. 2. Honey Tequila Chicken Wings     Best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table. As you could surmise from the name of the dish, the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet, but they do come covered in slices of chilies. The heat-fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies (this is a simple task). Vegan and vegetarian options are available!"

The MUST eats include:* Kimchi fries - sounds funny, but imagine savory fries with an extra spicy cake from the kimchi. The kimchi did not appear to be aged for too long so no sourness here. Just a bit of tart and an extra kick of spicy. * Shrimp tacos - loved this! Though I'm not sure if the tortillas were made from flour or corn. Perhaps a combination of the two? I prefer corn but the prawns were so large and juicy that all is forgiven * Quesadillas - my gf loved this dish so much that she ordered it twice. Both for herself. * California Salad - got give some love to my home state and the salad is pretty great. Win-win all around (especially when you start thinking of about the carbs + fat + cheese + calories on the menu). The MUST drinks include:* Vatos magaritas, aka, a large magarita with a bottle of beer popped in -try ""Grow a Pear"" or ""Sexy Sanchez."" (Please don't Google the latter until you've tried the drink.)* Texas Tea - This thing was HUGE! Not a surprise as it includes 6 kinds of liquors. I usually finish my cocktails in about 30 minutes, but this baby lasted me the whole night so it's worth that hefty price tag. I also tried the Mexican Martini but it was too sweet for me. This came as a surprise since it was a martini and I'm a lady. Perhaps those with a sweet(er) tooth would enjoy the Mexican Martini more. The atmosphere is great...almost like stepping into a TexMex steak house. I also love the concept of an open kitchen. The open bar helped as well. Seating-wise, be prepared for stools and no place to hang those handbags. My lady friends and those with bad posture/backs/necks, you have been warned. Oh yea, the bathroom is located upstairs so you'll need to walk outside of the restaurant, hop into an elevator, and go through a club before you can reach your destination. Vatos will definitely make a mark in the Singapore food scene, especially since Korean + Mexican fusion has yet to be witnessed and tasted by most locals and many expats. Coming from California, this fusion isn't something new (heard of bulgogi tacos anyone? Soooooo 2003.), and would satisfy the cravings of old timers like myself. Can't wait to return and make Vatos a daily stable in my diet. Psssst...Vatos is located below Vanity. Eat here before drinking and partying."

I am not a Korean food lover. I am an original cuisine lover. I am not crazy over fusion and its blings and gimmicks. I am a simple man with simple love for simple excellent food. I see the great reviews therefore I decide to try this place since I have never had any Mexican food in Singapore before. So I came here to try if the fusion between Korean and Mexican could be something that I love. I was overwhelmed by the choices of food on the menu actually. It comes to starter (nachos usually and chicken wings?), tacos, quesadillas, burritos (that I note none of the reviewers have tried?), drinks. Usually in great authentic mexican restaurant, you will know whether you want tongue, shoulders, chicken, fish, etc for each. Here there are many to choose with its description of the sauce and everything. Food 3.5/5I opted for the barbacoa pork shoulder taco with vatos special sauce and yes they are pretty spicy. The taco is not using usual tortilla but something stronger to hold all the leaking meats on the taco, yes it is gonna get messy. Pork is tender, sauce is good, portion is generous, so great value for the money: 11$ for 2 tacos. I also ordered the pork kimchi quesadillas since it seems to be one of their main item and I note many of reviewers really love their kimchi fries. The quesadillas is not using tortilla, instead using the same ingredients of flour that make a Korean kimchi pancake. It is pretty crisp, cheese inside is melting, but pork flavor is overpowered by the sauce and everything else. It is quite pricey for 18$.Again I am more into a simple food that could bring forth the original ingredients' taste and texture. In vatos, it is being a fusion restaurant, the main attraction is the sauce at the end, even though yes, the meat is tender. But I believe that it is being prepped and cooked with care and love by the team :) it is not what I will definitely get to visit when I have the chance. Btw drinks is quite pricey and they don't seem to offer any happy hour. Service 4.5/5Venue 5/5 Great place to hang out since it is cozy and comfortable. Overall 3.5/5 :) it is a great place for anyone looking for something new and a fan of fusion food. All reviews are based on my taste for original Mexican food in San Diego and Jakarta/Bali with its Taco Local."

When I saw a Mexican Korean fusion place with good ratings, had to go try it out. There were many reviews about the special, the Korean Kimchi fries but didn't try them out. Had 2 of the Korean pork bbq tacos instead. The tacos had a nice touch of sliced dikon/radish with good pickled flavors. The pieces of pork bbq were decent, though sliced a bit different than I normally see. They were more chunks of pork rather than slices of Korean Pork that you normally see. The Mexican flavoring was on the light side. Would've liked to see more salsa and spice to the dish. The salsa in the tacos was underwhelming. The chips that they provided as an appetizer was a nice change. Instead of chips as small pieces it came out as 3 large pieces of chips that you broke into pieces. But it was a bit on the stale side, maybe came at the wrong time as it was 3 in the afternoon once I made it out here after checking into my hotel. The salsa tasted like back home with the green chile verde and regular hot red spicy sauces.They did have nice craft beers though, didn't know they had these types of beers in Singapore. The place has a happy hour, or late night drinking and tacos or fries type of feel to it. Will have to come back with some colleagues for some food and drinks. Once I try the Korean Kimchi fries and some more drinks the rating may improve."

The spicy chicken tacos were served with soft shell tortillas- messy and great tasting with fresh ingredients and tender chicken that came with two sauces.  Albeit not very spicy but still pretty memorable.

Not easy to see from the street, look for the South Beach Tower - the restaurant is tucked into the white alcoved building on the Beach Road side. I was seated at the bar right away, visiting right when they open at noon on a Tuesday. Immediately greeted by the bartender offering a nice selection of draft beers: curiously all American micros like Left Coast, Modern Times, and Stone. I was perusing the menu for only a minute before another staff member came by, asked if it's my first time, and made food recommendations. I ordered the prawn and pork belly tacos (2 each). Right away chips (which are three giant tortilla chips) were served with both green and red salsa, which were both very tasty with a bit of spice. The food came quickly and was presented simply: two tacos each on two small plates. The pork belly tacos are served with red and white onions, and are a bit sweet and very tender. Very nice. The prawn taco is similar to a fish taco you would get in San Diego, with cole slaw and salsa. The prawns are lightly fried. Tacos are $5-6 each, minimum two per kind per order and come on light tortillas. 4 tacos with the chips and salsa and a beer was plenty of food for me. Overall a five-star experience all around, from the service to the food to the ambience. Definitely check it out if you're craving tacos in Singapore."

This place really reminded me of the K-Mex type places in SoCal, especially Los Angeles. The ingredients are tasty and fresh, and the corn tortillas are rolled fresh in the kitchen. I usually get the kalbi short rib, korean pork belly and baja fish tacos, and the kimchi carnitas fries. It's that interesting spicy fusion cuisine that brings back memories of LA.

Vatos is a chain from Seoul, started by three former Korean-American California residents.

Every single dish we ordered was on point:1) Kimchi Fries - I've never had anything like it and it was so good. They even include a sweet sauce that balances the flavors completely. I can eat this alone all day long.2) Short rib tacos - Really really good3) Baja Fish Tacos - Another wow. I grew up loving Rubio's Fish Tacos in California and I actually like this one at Vatos much better. It's crispy enough and full of flavor.4) Honey Tequila Chicken Wings - Really good but be careful, these are spicy!5) Chips and Guacamole - Great guacamole.They have your range of Lost Coast Brewery beers on tap. Service is great and ambiance is very grungy and cool. Highly recommend to bring friends or a date for something different that will be more exciting than your usual dinners."

The kimchi fries are a must try; we also had their galbi tacos and the kimchi pork quesadilla The quesadilla was done like a Korean pancake  Very very nice - although these three dishes were a tad bit of carb overload for our party of two. Our small stomachs are to blame though! The kor-mex fusion is done very nicely; almost bringing me back to LA / ItaewonI wouldn't recommend seating outside though - i think that's where the kitchen ventilators get released , it smells too much of oil for my liking.

When someone says tacos my mind goes to Mexico, spicy zesty fresh...  You won't get it here. If I want to be critical then this place lacks of food identity. If I want Mexican I won't come here, if I want Korean I won't come here, if in mood for Asian fusion same thing.

One drink should last you the whole night, no worries. Sharable if you don't want to spend 30 bucks on drinks as it is again, huge.Guacamole chips ($10) were underwhelming though, would have like it to have more lime and seasoning in it.

I'd been on the hunt for months and hadn't found anything decent. Vatos looked promising, so I headed in for lunch one afternoon. I found it to be just tolerable in terms of food, but was pleasantly surprised by my drink.  I got the cowboy margarita. It tasted great and was pretty strong by Singapore standards. There's also a little beer selection in addition to the cocktails. The chicken fajita burrito was disappointing. Its mild spice was the only redeeming quality. Underneath that spice is a bland excuse for a burrito. The chicken was gross and the vegetables indistinguishable. There was some appetizer that was basically fries covered in slop. Again, pretty bland. Large portions. My grandparents were in love with this place. The entire meal they were making comments about how they wished they had Vatos in the US, the fries are SO GOOD, just the right amount of spice, tacos look authentic etc. It was nice to see them enjoying a meal with such enthusiasm. But these are people who voluntarily eat at Aztecas (American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant). I could definitely recommend this place for drinks, but I'd avoid the food if you've had legit Mexican before. As a bar, 4 stars. As a restaurant, 2."

I ordered the spicy chicken tacos (orders come in 2 or 3 tacos), and wow! Nice, fresh chicken with a spicy (a little on the mild side for me) sauce and soft corn tortilla. Yes, it was different from authentic so-cal or Tex-Mex, but what do you expect from an Asian infused Mexican joint? I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food and this hit the spot.

Very lively atmosphere perfect for a night out. We walked into Torasho Ramen and Charcoal Bar on a busy Friday night without any reservation but lucky us, we scored a table by the bar because someone didn't turn up! The restaurant has a chillax and lively vibe, with over-enthusiastic staff, great song playlist while the ever-efficient chef and sous-chefs working their magic in the open kitchen. The name of this restaurant is quite misleading - the restaurant does not focus entirely on ramen but also small and big plates for sharing. We ordered Lobster dry ramen as ""starter"" followed by wagyu chips, grilled oysters, chicken wings karaage and ending the meal with a beautiful slab of 150gm Kagoshima beef. The wagyu chips are a show stopper, so simple yet so delicious. It's super addictive - potato chips fried in wagyu fats and drizzle with bits of truffle. Sounds amazing already! The dry lobster ramen is good to share, while the Kagoshima beef is so good. Get it done medium rare, so it's juicy and tender. Of all the dishes we ordered, the grilled oysters would probably be my least favourite, so I'll probably give it a pass next time. Tras Street is already dotted with many interesting restaurants and Torasho is a great addition to the quieter part of Tanjung Pagar district. You can't miss the restaurant if you're coming from Chinatown, as it's the first restaurant you see on your right. To make it easier, it's opposite Six Senses Hotel Maxwell. I highly recommend this restaurant for it's chill vibes where you can eat, talk and laugh without being tied to the etiquette of a fine dining restaurant. The affordable price point and great service already warrant a return visit for sure. So, come one come all!"

Yesterday was not my first visit but after all these years, pre pandemic and we are still in a pandemic, the price remained somewhat the same. Personally I find the $64 per pax for a lunch  buffet reasonable. So after many visits to Colony, what did I notice?FOOD 4/5The Chinese section (dim sum) of the buffet remained the same. As in, they were not good. They never improved since my first review here. If those dim sum was the same served at their Chinese restaurant Summer Pavilion, rest assured I would never go there for dim sum. So let's name a few items I had: Fried Fish (The Wok section) - the batter was chewy, the fish was somewhat fishy. That's a no for me.Prawns with veggies (can't remember the name, also The Wok section) - 5/5 love it! The prawns were huge and very fresh. Chicken Radish Soup 5/5 So good!! Tasted like what my mom made in the past.Seafood Ramen 4/5 not bad but where were the seafood? Lucky for the patrons at Colony, i do not eat cold seafood, cooked or uncooked. They were standing in line and looking so pleased. I walked past the seafood section, two thumbs up cos they looked very fresh. Good for those who enjoyed them! Chicken Rice -4/5 Good, they nailed the rice of course and poached chicken was soft and tender. Bread & Butter 5/5 - Onion roll was amazing! The butter was as good as MEGGLE, my personal fav. Dessert (Lychee Rose, Mango Pudding, Tiramisu, Pandan Gula Melaka cake and Green Tea tart)- 5/5 I enjoyed every bit of it.Mango juice was so so good!!! 5/5What to improve?? Pre pandemic their Western section was so good. In fact, that section was my favorite of all. They did away and set up a Grill & Rotisserie section. I found the items unexciting. Sorry!AMBIANCE 5/5Always love the ambiance at the Colony!! Lots of natural lighting.SERVICE 5/5 *****Solid 5 stars!! I never had a bad service at Ritz Carlton. Yesterday was another wonderful service provided by their staffs. Jane, Carmela and Kelly were very nice but the MVP went to Iraj. Iraj was very attentive, polite and friendly from the start to finish. He constantly cleared our used plates, checking in on us throughout the lunch, refilling our water. Iraj is the epitome of top notch service at a 5 star hotel.I took my bestie out for lunch since I have not officially took her out to celebrate her acceptance  to Stanford. Iraj brought out a beautiful fruit platter with candle and a piece of chocolate saying ""Congratulations!"" Many thanks Iraj! Look forward to seeing you the next time I visit Colony!!"

Buffets are typically unattractive gorge-fest atmospheres filled with gluttony and sloppiness everywhere, but Colony puts a whole new spin on it. The restaurant puts other buffets to shame, adding a major touch of classiness and romanticism to it all.The restaurant is located in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and can easily be found in the lobby. Customers are first greeted by the Patisserie section, with its delectable collection of pastries and desserts, before making their way onto the dining area. After a quick glance, one might even want to skip straight to dessert -- that is, until they lay their eyes on one of the other 6 sections of the buffet.Besides the Patisserie, there's the following sections, which are all connected to one another:ICE BAR - Jumbo shrimp cocktail, snow crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, craw fish, sashimi, sushi, etc.GRILL & ROTISSERIE - Grilled ham, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, sausage, squash, kale, etc.STEAM BASKET - Steamed dim sum, buns, ready to made hot pot food, fish balls, noodles, etc.WOK - Chinese/Malay cuisine, such as, steamed fish, chili crab, fried rice, prawns, ribs, vermicelli, etc.TANDOOR - Indian cuisine, such as, various curries, basmati rice, etc.FRUIT STALL - Juices and whole fruitsI probably did not come close to naming every single food that was served in each section, but it should give any hungry person an idea prior to walking in. I can't fit a comment here on every single item, but to summarize, the seafood was extremely fresh, the sushi was great for a buffet, the hot foods from the Chinese/Malay/Indian cuisine sections were very tasty. We didn't find a single thing wrong with anything we ate. By far the most attractive section though was the Patisserie. The assortment of pastries and little desserts here and there were fantastic and any dessert lover's dream. It really gave us the opportunity to sample away because they were small enough.Yes, the buffet is $88 per adult for dinners .. and it's totally worth it with the amazing selection and chill atmosphere. Buffets aren't typically thought of as date restaurants, but Colony really redefines what a buffet is. On top of it all, our waiter was excellent. He knew we were here for our honeymoon and even gave us a quick tour of the buffet when we arrived so we wouldn't get lost. The perfect buffet? If it's not, it's damn close to it."

I started off with the laksa which is one of my favorite dishes I have had in Singapore, then transitioned into the heavier foods. They have a great spread of cold cuts, paté, and jamón ibérico, aside a large selection of cheeses to choose from. Their sushi selection is not too extensive but it does have the main crowd favorites: salmon, tuna, yellowtail. They have both sashimi and nigiri, as well as a few simple sushi rolls to choose from. They had a great seafood selection and delicious fresh oysters too!I loved their salted egg chicken wings! They taste exactly like salted egg and are so so good! Very crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor, I wish I had gotten more. They also have a unique selection of bread, the wheat and seaweed ones were my favorite. The desserts were one of my favorite parts of the buffet! There was every kind of pastry imaginable, and you bet your ass I tried them all! Lol my favorites were the Carmel brûlée, truffles, and gelato. But there are so many more I am probably not remembering so be sure to give them all a taste, they are small portions so as long as you pase yourself you should be fine.The service was just as good as the food. Our server was cheetah, I apologize I I spelled that incorrectly. He was very attentive and checked up on us very frequently to clear our plates.

The dividers, decorated with antiques and imagery of Singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet. Selections are very vast, making it difficult to make a decision. Every piece of the meal was amazing, with the exception of one dish, the chicken curry in the Malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry.The service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out The St Regis where we spent the last evening in Singapore. Sitting next to the bamboo garden here is very relaxing and the building provides a fair share of natural light. So, don't get discouraged by the otherwise sad looking architecture of this building and the cramped, boring entrance into the property, this restaurant is a must for luxurious breakfast."

Everything is high quality, but if you're a tourist here, I still recommend that you go outside and try all these at their respective restaurants for a more authentic experience. As a resident here, I decided to focus on their western spreads. Of course, I loaded up on all the fancy cheeses and charcuterie. I really enjoyed their roast, along with all the curries in the Indian section. The desserts also had a western focus, with things like cookies, ice cream sundaes, and pies, though they did have some nice kuehs to choose from.

The Colony at the Ritz Carlton is a buffet you literally dream about.  At some point during the buffet, I literally thought I was stealing. The SGD88 price per person vs. the collection of food offered is simply absurd!First the seafood bar is out of this world. What buffet offers three types of oysters: Canadian, French and Irish so customers can different tasting oysters from sweet to salty to creamy to everything in between. Wow! Obviously, these oysters are air flown from where ever they are located in the world, so don't expect absolute freshness. Nevertheless, it was more than satisfying. Next to the oyster baskets are whole crabs, half cracked lobster claws (the ones you find in Maine), mussels, clams. Honestly, I couldn't contain myself. No where in Singapore can eat 3 whole lobsters and a dozen oysters in one sitting and not break the bank.Other than the seafood bar, there was a sushi/sashimi bar, Indian buffet, Chinese / Singaporean buffet. Other note worthy dishes included: all you can eat Chilli Crab Claws, butter grilled half cut lobster tails, XO fried rice. The Ambience is great, perfect for a Friday night date, and service is impeccable. A must try, indeed!"

What could be better to relish an authentic afternoon tea experience than having a traditional British style three-tier afternoon tea set here?  In fact, decor is a key draw here.I was instantly attracted to the eclectic settings when I stepped in. Adorned on the walls and partitions are old maps, photographs, alongside with vintage black-and-white crockery which I secretly wished I could bring some back home. In line with the concept of the restaurant, there is some local twist to what would otherwise be a strictly English tea. The golden raisins and plan scones, baked in-house, was served with scented Kaya jam, clotted cream and lemon curd, which somehow reminds me of a delicious Kaya toast when I put everything into my mouth. The second deck and third deck feature an assortment of sandwiches and sweet pastries, including a entire slab of peppered foie gras on beef pastrami! Simply too indulgent!But if you jumped to the conclusion that it is the usual mixed of sweets, savouries and scones, then you are wrong. It includes a plate of incredibly fluffy savoury pancake, topped with sour cream and French caviar for that touch of luxe. And when it comes to tea, it's serious business here. Go for the signature brew called Colony Tea, a custom blend of black and white Sumatran tea leaves from Tea Bone Zen Mind that is soothing without any bitter or harsh tang. The most unique aspect is the addition of flavored syrup such as French Rose, Ginger, Lavender, Palm and Cinnamon, Pandan and Pineapple to enhance the tea. They work to tease out the nuances of the tea and create a therapeutic experience as one slowly sips along with the light bites.Available daily except Sundays, this afternoon tea also comes with a glass of Moet & Chandon Brut Imperial Champagne. Indeed, Colony doesn't only set itself apart from other local high tea by virtue of its nostalgic charm, the quality of food and tea are highly accomplished as well. If you favour both substance and style, this would fit the bill."

We went to colony this Monday. The restaurant was not full house though. However we were given a make shift squeezed table of Five by a service staff Nina. At first she refused to change table for us, saying that the table is ok with 5 people and the restaurant was fully booked. We told her to call for the manager,then she agree to change to another proper table for 5 persons.                                                                     The food in the Colony is getting very boring with declining quality. The Japanese counter sashimi and sushi are the standard offerings with no creativity. The color and presentation of food were not attractive. The worst is at the Chinese counter. The dim sum was terrible with no quality control. The texture of dim sum was either rubbery and the Sui Mai texture was soft and starchy with no prawn and meat texture. The Laksa noodles gravy does not taste like Laksa at all. The gravy was over cooked with a burnt taste.                                      The dessert counter was boring and there were no outstanding desserts at all. Just average quality with variety. I was not even tempted to take any dessert when I pass by the dessert counter.                                                           Service was excellent apart from the Host blunder in table assignment.                                                       I realized nowadays 6stars hotel like Ritz Carlton, Fullerton, due to their reputation and good business , have ignored their initial brand promise to customers. They are sitting on their laurels because the numbers are good and get carried away with food quality and presentation of food. No use of providing wide variety of food, if as a six star hotel restaurants is unable to deliver a 6star professional attitude towards its operations in quality, presentation and innovation of the food offerings to your customers! I realized the so called 6 star hotel restaurants in Singapore cannot be compared with those in Thailand and Hong Kong! The owners of 6 star hotels needs to shake up the hotel management staff and constantly keep them in checked to deliver the brand promise and commitment to their customers !"

Formerly branded as the Greenhouse, the Ritz has put much thought and effort into reorganizing the buffet areas into a more consolidated and efficient operation. They've also changed the feel of the dining room by adding partition walls that display framed stock photos all with the theme: colonization.The effect of the heavily used partition wall modules is that of a Pottery Barn store. The feel is that all of the framed photos are on display to sell. The only thing missing are the price tags. The Wall Modules break up the large space creating a more intimate dining experience. What is lost is the joy of people watching during the brunch. With the serving stations all moved to a remote (mostly hidden) location at the rear of the restaurant and the partition walls segmenting the space into smaller dining areas, the feel is not as good as the Greenhouse. The wide spectrum of food offerings are enough to please any palette. Local, Indian, Western, Seafood, Cheese, Breads, Desserts, etc. In addition to the free flow champagne, bartenders are on duty to make Bloody Marys and Espresso Martinis. I had several of each and both were delicious.The staff is friendly, well trained and attentive. Champagne glasses were always kept full, empty plates continually cleared, and Bloody Marys and Martinis delivered upon request. The Good: Food Quality, Staff, AmbianceThe Bad: I'm not a fan of the maze-like new partition wall modules that detract from the grand architectural space and prefer the more open and spacious feel of the Greenhouse. Hands down, the Greenhouse was a much better brunch experience.The Verdict: Colony is a prime player in the Singapore Sunday Brunch scene. Glad to have visited, but I think I'll wait for the bi-annual ""Super Brunch"" before returning."

Perhaps it was just a bad batch from that day?Noodle and seafood:4/5, I paid extra to get the bowl loaded with shrimps and crawfish (baby lobster), noodles was good, no complaints here.Value: 4/5, even with all the extra seafood loaded in my bowl I think it was only like $9 SGP, which is a great deal.  if you eat in a nice restaurant the price can easily be doubled if not more.Overall I was somewhat disappointed by this famous laksa, the broth in particular was a letdown for me."

Given this fact, it took a little searching and a lot of google map checking to find this place.Despite the relative difficulty of finding this place though, the search is more than worth the effort. The Laksa here has a thick, rich soup similar to the best ramen shops I have been to while in Japan. And each bowl of Laksa has a large helping of seafood with a generous setving of noodles. However, what is perhaps the most surprising thing about the Laksa here is that the broth is able to preserve its rich taste by relying on seafood products as opposed to using fattier meats and other animal products (pork, beef, etc.).The price here is also ideal at under 10 singaporean dollars a bowl. This is a place I would highly recommend."

The particular bowl we ordered from here will forever stand out in my memory as the best I've tasted thus far and they have made me a future repeat customer on any subsequent visits to the hot and humid city-state.Containing all the seafood items inside a typical bowl of laksa, it didn't have any trace of old fishy flavor or aroma that has happened on a few occasions that I've experienced elsewhere. Instead it had a much more rather sweet and savory mix of flavors and aroma. The laksa here really impressed me down to the toothsome noodles.

According to one of Miguel's colleagues, he tried their foie gras fried rice and loved it, but it might've been a seasonal dish as it wasn't on the menu and our server didn't seem to know what it was. Miguel did try the pork belly fried rice and thought it was top notch.Maybe lunch is a different story, but for dinner, the restaurant seems to exude this sleaziness that I can't explain. Perhaps it's because we're in the basement and there's no windows? Or maybe it's the clientele (mostly businessmen) added in with the mostly female staff (but in their defense, they don't dress like sluts.) Then there's the decor- yes, Botticelli's ""Birth of Venus"" is a tasteful nude... but when an almost-nude photo of the owner is included in the mix*, well... what are we supposed to think?Despite all of that, I did enjoy the food and I appreciated the relaxed atmosphere at the start of the weekend.

A few things on Misaki.  We live downtown and popped in on a Saturday night around 8:45PM. The place was a ghost town without another single patron in the restaurant.  Concerned that this must be a bad sign, we quickly figured out that this is simply one of those restaurants that is heavily visited and super busy with the thousands of people who work in the financial district for lunch and some nights during the week.  But on Saturday nights, it is more of a hidden quiet gem to people like us.  Don't let the quiet ambiance on a Saturday night be a deterrent.  We thought of it like an exclusive private dining room that nobody must know about.  The room is a bit dark, but it is professionally decorated, clean and open.  They have a sushi bar you can sit out, some small private rooms and also and open dining area.  Ruru was our waitress and she was excellent by being most gracious, friendly, welcoming, knowledgable about menu and provided guidance on fish selections.  The sushi chefs behind the counter were equally excellent in their craft and their welcoming of us being there.  The executive chef Ken could not have been more appreciative of our patronage when we departed.  I can never Yelp enough about how customer service is the key with any place I dine.  We felt very welcomed at Misaki.  We are new to Singapore, so we are doing our rounds around town from mid level and high brow sushi establishments to understand the market.  From Omakase to eateries at shopping malls, we will try anything.  Come to find out, a gem of a sushi spot is only minutes from us in downtown Singapore. The quality is exceptional at Misaki.  From the delicacy of toro to the mainstream of their salmon, the quality is there.  From the seaweed that wrapped the hand roll to the special fly fish that was recommended, the quality is there.  From the complimentary fish ball welcoming treat to the texture of the rice on the final piece of the spider roll consumed, the quality is there.  Now the prices are not out of sink with other places we have eaten sushi/sashimi (salmon $13SGD, spider roll $23SGD, Isaki $18SGD, toro $70SGD), but the quality is significantly better.  Although we ordered a la carte on this first visit, they do have a $100SGD set Omakase meal (Including sake) that seems like a good value for some sashimi and like 12 pieces of sushi.  We would like to try that the next time we are in.  Presentation is spot on.  The staff was gracious and welcoming.  The quality of the fish is noteworthy and noticeable.  Now going during the week for lunch is probably a zoo and other than the quality being the same, I am sure the experience is different.  But for dinner, we plan on returning often."

After traversing through the Cloud Forest, my friends and I were quite hungry and upon seeing that we had some $6 coupons that were only redeemable at here and Satay by the Bay, decided to give it a chance. Looking at the menu first, we were drawn in by the wide selection of all-day dim sum options as well as the Peking Duck that was advertised.They seated us quickly, and first impressions of the decorations and furnishings were not great--the tables and chairs were definitely well worn, and it felt more like an antiquated Chinese restaurant than a restaurant in a standout Singaporean attraction. The service took quite a while to get to us, and all ordering was done through a web menu, which we had some difficulty connecting to. We ordered quite a large amount of food, including (but with more that didn't strike my memory) the 1/4 Peking Duck, Chicken Feet, Duck-shaped Buns, Salted Egg Buns, and Hot and Sour Soup. They serve the Peking Duck with the skin and wrappers first, before later bringing out the meat, so I'd recommend waiting until that hits the table before making wraps. The 1/4 portion was just about enough for a group of three, alongside the myriad of other dishes that we ordered. The rest of the dishes were average, or slightly disappointing for their price. Our total cost came out to SGD$90, a bit much for Dim Sum, but a little more reasonable once we subtracted the value of the coupons.I ultimately can't recommend visiting for anything beyond using up your Food and Drink coupons, for which you should consider just stopping by for a light snack rather than eating your full meal here."

The salted egg custard buns had a gritty texture to the custard. Pass on those! The chicken rice was delicious. Service was off. We ordered dim sum to start and had to ask for soy.

Much as I am a fan of Chef Pang's flagship Majestic restaurant at Bukit Pasoh, his newest restaurant fell short for me.To be fair, the items that fell short are the dimsum items. We took the set menu which included 5 dimsums and they all range from not good to average. The other few items we picked from the ala carte dimsum menu were not much better either. None of the dimsum items were good.Apart from the 5 dimsum items, the $28 per person menu also included a soup of the day, a veggie, coffee pork belly, lobster bee hoon, mochi dessert.The soup was amazing. Classic Cantonese double-boiled soup. We were informed that it was in the pot for 6 hours and you can tell. Thick and sweet and savory, exactly how a good double-boiled soup should be.The famed lobster bee hoon is great. For a portion for 4 pax, I think we get the whole lobster though not a big one. The bee hoon is nicely simmered in the lobster broth and it still retains the al dente bite. Yumz.The coffee pork belly was a disaster. I couldn't eat it. Though the menu says it is pork ribs, our entire plate was pork belly coated in this weird tasting coffee rub.We started with a geoduck done two ways - sashimi and steamboat. It was as amazing as how a fresh geoduck should taste. The broth that came with the steamboat was also really flavorful and you can taste that it is from a really superior stock.If I do return, I would probably stick to the ala carte menu and maybe the seafood items. But for a better experience, I would rather go back to his flagship restaurant."

Following the success of Majestic Restaurant and Jing, Chef Yong Bing Ngen, best known for his contemporary Chinese cuisine, has ventured into the seafood restaurant market with his latest Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant. Expect some innovative seafood creations at this family friendly restaurant, which is quite a depart from the fine dining experience at the sister establishments.Located below the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, the spacious 110-seater restaurant is brightly lit by the natural light that streams in through the glass panels.  To kick off dinner, we had the Duo Seafood Combo,  ($28 for 4 person portion). Crispy lychee, crab meat, mushrooms; soft shell crabs, lemon butter milk sauce. I much preferred the former, which was an interesting savory and sweet combination. The lychee is also a great tenderizer and i loved how the moist center complemented the airy and buttery crust. The crabs were missing a little of that crustacean taste, probably due to the over seasoning with the sauce and thick batter.A good gauge of a Cantonese restaurant is by the quality of its soups and Majestic is fabulous that way. The Braised, Ocean Sunfish maw, crab meat, luffa, thicken yellow soup ($18/portion), , was very flavorful. The golden superior broth is made from a duck and chicken stock, blended with carrot and pumpkin and boiled for 6 hours! High quality strips of fresh fish maw and chunks of crab meat are used here. Flawless skin come to me now!Highlight of the night and undoubtedly the favorite dish. The Steamed Bamboo Clam, , (Market Price) was simply divine. The seasoning was really quite simple, leaving the focus on the succulent and crunchy bamboo clams. I love how the glass noodles (tang hoon) soaks up the garlic sauce that was flavored with the essence of the shellfish. Give me seconds anytime.This is the signature ""Kopi"" Crab, , that has tourists making a beeline to Gardens by the Bay. The Sri Lankan crab is cooked with a special sauce made from a blend of 3 different varieties of coffee beans. Marmalade and orange juice is also used in the sauce.The crab was flambéed at the table with a mixture of rice wine, coffee liqueur and coffee beans to give it that caramel crust. And truth be told, it tasted more like caramel popcorn than coffee. If you like sweet stuff, you may like this crab. As for me, i still prefer the savory ones.The Seafood Baked Rice, , ($68 for 4-6 persons, $88 for 7-12 persons) was spectacular when presented. This is one massive pan of rice piled generously with baby abalones, scallops, mussels and prawns, as well as mushrooms (not the chinese sort). The flavor of the sauce is a mix of Portuguese and Japanese Curry, lightly spiced and savory. Save a little space for desserts. If you like variety, the Sweet's temptation, , ($20 for 4 persons) is the way to go. The dessert platter includes 4 different desserts which i felt was very reasonably priced. Start with the lightest tasting Mochi stuffed with fresh cream, chopped mangoes and strawberries, each bite is like biting into a cloud, all fluffy and dreamy. Definitely another favorite of mine.While i love salted egg yolk steamed buns, the ones at Majestic failed to impress me. Too little filling and it was lacking in the salted egg yolk richness and taste. Overall, it was a pleasing meal at Majestic Bay Restaurant. While i may not be back for the signature dishes like the Kopi Crab, i'd certainly make an effort to check out their lunch time dim sum. For $28/pax on weekdays and $33/pax on weekends (min 4 pax), it's value for money for a 6 course meal with 3 mains included!"

Besides drinks, it is also a restaurant and offers 2 course and 3 course lunch set during weekdays. The place is decorated in modern and stylish way with open kitchen.I was showed to a counter who offered a great view of the chefs making desserts. While it was noisy with the noise from the kitchen, it was funny watching the staffs at work. And I got most of the dishes served straight from the chefs, who also explained about the dishes themselves. Between the 2 course and 3 course lunch, I decided to go with the 3 course which cost $60++. I started the meal with an aperitif cocktail.Tanaka Collins ($20++)yuzu vodka, citrus, gomme, sodaThe drink was like a lemonade soda. I felt that the vodka part was barely there.The lunch began with a a trio of amuse-bouches.The first amuse-bouche was curry leave tempura with a coconut curry mousse, served in a rock. The tempura was light and crispy, while the curry flavour was barely there. It was really unexpected.The next amuse-bouche was charred grilled red pepper in squid ink tempura, served on a stone plate with tweezers.The tempura was light and crispy. It was served with a soy wasabi dip which tasted stronger in miso than wasabi.The last amuse-bouche served was basil sauce with tomato flavoured olive oil. It looked like a lava lamp. The basil and tomato were distinct. Although it looked like oil, the taste was not that oily.Starter : Artichoke Soupquail egg, air baguette, avruga caviarThe soup smelt great from far. It was rich and creamy. But the surprise of the dish was the air baguette which turned to be a crispy pillow puff. It was encased with a smoky savoury mousse which filled with seafood flavours.Main : Braised Pigs Earchicken & truffle mousse, morels, pomme mousseline, perigourdine jusThe pig ear was crunchy and soft, with a savoury stuffing, sitting on top of a savoury mash potato mousse. The morels (a type of mushrooms) were well braised and juicy. The spinach which served with it was disappointing as it was too salty and overcooked with parts tasting quite bitter.Dessert : Snickers Bar Souffle peanut butter mini magnumThe souffle was light and airy, with a bit of nutty texture at the bottom. The magnum had bits of peanut butter in it.Lastly there was petiti four to end the meal with. There was crunchy almonds slices topped with almond mousse and compressed blueberries, matcha chocolate with yuzu drop, and hazelnut praline chocolate. I was very full but these were so yummy.Overall the food was unique in its own way, offering an unique experience in taste and presentation. Service was great, with water refilled often.

You sample the bears, which surprisingly taste EXACTLY like the cocktail, and therefore get to sample each drink before you buy. I call it a gimmick, because that is what it is, but I could not adore this concept anymore than I do. It's adorable, it's useful, the bears are SPOT ON in flavor, and it's a snack..

My girlfriend and I made last minute weekday night reservations to try out the #36 spot in the top 50 restaurants in Asia. We never made any attempt prior to check it out here since the menus that they post on the restaurant's website seem like they serve dishes that we really wouldn't like - things like ox tongue, foie gras, pigeon, pork collar, eel as a starter, etc etc. A mix of so many different foods that I don't imagine are that creative in my mind. Boy was I hugely mistaken.The Tippling Club has two menus for dinner - their 6 course ""classic"" menu which runs around 2 hours and their 10 course ""gourmand"" menu which they say takes around 3.5-4 hours (you'll find that time goes very fast here). As with any restaurant that offers this, SIT AT THE COUNTER AND WATCH ART IN ACTION. Seeing how delicately each meal is prepared will give your date an experience she will remember not to mention your food is guaranteed to taste a LOT better since you witnessed its preparation.Very quickly - for those that are going for cocktails only:TRY OUT THE EAST INDIA 1885 - one of the best cocktails I've ever tried anywhere!!!!! TRY OUT THE SMOKEY OLD FASHIONED AS A NIGHTCAP!!!!! TRY THE JUNGLE OLD FASHIONED IN BETWEEN!!!!My girlfriend really enjoyed her JUNIPER SLING.SARTORIAL was pretty good.PINK PEPPERCORN NEGRONI was good if you are in the mood for a negroni with a slight twist.FIG SIDECAR was okPURPLE DRANK tastes like cough syrup and even comes in a medicine bottle. I think some other yelpers said they like it so maybe to each their own.GOT MILK? wasn't good at all. This is part of the pairing with the classic menu.Back to dinner -What we found out after we opted for the shorter classic menu was that the menu only gives a preview of what you will get. However, what you actually get is far from anything you would imagine in terms of appearance, flavors and the whole creative package. They also give you the option to do a wine paring which we didn't do but instead picked out a bunch of their cocktails which was the better decision.So what was part of the classic menu? Unfortunately I wasn't able to understand much at all of what the chefs were describing, but I'll do my best.1) Snacks - started with a tom yum mayo paste with a very nice lightly fried and crisp veggie (what looked like arugula). Then to a clear puffed beef tendon with some light salty powder. Then to a red shishito (or similar) pepper charred until black with a brown wasabi sauce. It looks like poop but tastes amazing. I was a little bit taken back by this, not sure how I feel about the chef serving what looked like poop to us. Even though it tasted great, in a small sense it feels like the chef is poking fun at the guest. Then had a shooter that was incredible but don't know what it was.2) Eel first course which wasn't prepared like what we were expecting (unagi style) but done extremely nicely and beautifully with garnishes that looked like an artwork but each of them carrying a punch of flavor. Beautifully done with a mustard ice cream on the side which compliments the flavors so well.3) Scallops with parsley root and purple garlic soup - WOW!! Another beautiful dish that I finished so quickly that I didn't remember eating it. 4) Rockling and Smoked Ox Tongue - I expected this to be much different than it actually was but wow this was incredible. I don't actually like ox tongue but they did it in such a way here that it was excellent with hay baked beetroot and horseradish.5) Pigeon - This was the one plate that was the same as any other pigeon you would find at any other restaurant. Even still has some gamey-ness to it. Presentation-wise even wasn't too creative compared to every other dish.6) Textured Milk - This one was fun. Very good dessert. I highly recommend not going with the ""Got Milk?"" cocktail pairing for this. It doesn't at all taste like the description reads (tipping club milk tea, sakura flower and dark rum). My gf and I both didn't like it at all.7) Petit fours - Great selection of coconut chocolates, tofu cream and something else. Service is perfect. Only complaint I have is that I feel they should take drinks off the final bill if you barely touch it. My gf barely sipped her PURPLE DRANK and they only just took the glass and left. One of the staff members spilled one of our other cocktails which we barely touched (and it was sitting for a while) and they didn't take it off the check.Otherwise, we loved it here. This is what culinary creativity is in its finest. Highly recommend!!"

Smoky Old Bastard - the idea of serving a cocktail with smoke or scented air is brilliant.  The execution here isn't as brilliant as the Aviary in Chicago, but it is still a fun drink, even though the liquor at the bottom is scotch with some butters. #2. Transatlanticism - main components are amaro and whiskey.  I loved how the spiciness of the amrao comes out.  Solid drink.#3. Purple Drank - brilliant packaging, serving a cocktail in a cough syrup bottle, down to the box.  Problem is, it also tastes very much like cough syrup, so while this was a little tough to drink in its entirety, those who like jaegermeister will love this.#4. Genever Martinez (off menu) - after 3 house cocktails, I wanted to see how they did with some classics.  I tried a martinez, substituting genever for gin.  Perfectly executed.#5. Old fashioned with Willet rye - perfect nightcap.  So overall, I really enjoyed the drinks here, and the staff is great too.  The lounge room is a little awkward, though, and it's not great for large groups (I would probably get rid of the door).  But it's definitely worth checking out for drinks, and the menu looked very promising too (5 or 10 course tasting menu). They have some of the most creative drinks, but also nail the classics!"

She was quite interested in seeing Singapore's trendiest F&B spots, so we figured we'd take her here for after-dinner drinks and dessert.For a weekday, the restaurant was buzzing, but the bar was pretty quiet. I didn't mind this at all, since it meant better service and ambiance for conversation. I liked that the cocktail menu still had a few drinks that were there since the last time I visited (which was over a year ago at their Dempsey location. Time flies when you're busy stuffing your face with hawker food.) Of course, there were some new and seasonal cocktails as well, which is always refreshing to see! Since I was on a whiskey roll, I decided on the Smokey Old Bastard. True to its name, it came to me in a tall glass filled with smoke. I have no idea how they created it, but nevertheless I enjoyed my smokey (literally and... taste...fully??) beverage. I recommend drinking this a bit quickly though, as the ice melts fast. The tears that end up in there due to losing $25 on a watered down strong one doesn't help, either. The chocolate and orange dessert was just alright. I wish I took a picture of the spoons that they gave us to use, because it looked more like a soup ladle with more width than length. Basically, it made it really difficult to eat the dessert, and was the most impractical utensil I've seen in a while.Definitely a great spot for drinks, though it'll cost ya. Wouldn't mind revisiting for a nightcap or a special occasion."

Immediately spotted a great mix of expats and locals, and the place had a very cosy feel to it despite a very obvious attempt at maximizing every inch of space they had.We were seated at the bar, my friend was friends with their mixologist and I had a fabulous night for obvious reasons. I started off with the Purple Drank, housed in a cough syrup bottle in a box, and you literally sip out of that cough mixture bottle. I was pleasantly surprised that the raspberry flavoured cocktail with curacao was refreshingly good, a tad bit pricy at $23, but at places like these, one can only expect prices as such. I had a few other customized drinks as well, courtesy of their expert mixologists, and I was left wanting more. All their cocktails are uniquely presented, surprising you at every step of the way. The Tippling club would be perfect for a fun first date, or to celebrate a birthday with friends.  I've good things about the culinary wares available, but did not get the opportunity to give it a shot. Definitely going to head back there to try them out.

My favorite is the Smokey Old Bastard. I take all my boys here whenever we need to celebrate a birthday. Orange infused whiskey in a flask, filled with cigar smoke? Baby, this is better than you birthday suit! Of course, the other drinks are fabulous as well. Purple Drank, anyone? Vanilla & raisin spirit, curacao, candy gomme, raspberry, citrus. Notice, no grape juice. But it's still purple and my kind of drraaankkk! The only downfall I see is that this place closes promptly at midnight. So if you arrive at 11:30, they may turn you away. So if you're an oldie, who still likes to draaaankkk, come here towards the last leg of your night (perhaps at 11:00?) and when Tippling Club closes, a perfect excuse to go home. Another tip?

It's been a while.4.5 stars.I have mixed feelings about the new location at Tippling Club. On the one hand, Dempsey hill feels like a world away, far from the madding crowd, a charming township full of restaurants and art galleries. On the other, Dempsey Hill is a little bit of a trek from where we are, or anywhere really, it looks like. The restaurant itself was also much more formal, yet evoking memories of your last tropical vacation. They have since reinvented themselves to be on Tanjong Pagar, in a bustling neighbourhood, and the music is louder, the place is smaller, and it feels a lot more mainstream.Much has been said about the tastebud tickling culinary gimmicks that Ryan Clift's establishment spews out on a regular basis. Whether you go for the elaborate tasting menu or a mere cocktail, I think it is easy to say that you will be surprised. We've had the tasting menus as well as the bar food at Tippling Club. It's the kind of quirky stuff that Heston Blumenthal inspires in people. I daresay that if Mr Fat Duck ever ate here.. he might quite like it. The charred peppers taste unusually fresh for something that looks black like coal. While the sauce has been changed, the dish is still enjoyable. We've sipped consommes from test tubes here, eaten mustard ice cream, chomped on seaweed crisps, had carrots 3 ways,  imbibed foams and broths and air and what not. All good, all good. The cocktail menu deserves a special mention, as I have landed up here on more occasions for a drink that I have for food. The old favourites include Old Man and the Sea (light rum) , and smokey old bastard (islay). The clutching hand with whisky, fernet branca and lemon is great as well. Among the new additions, the low profile fashion choices is my favourite - with whisky, salt caramel, earl grey and chocolate, this could have been all over the place. Instead they created a beautiful concoction that takes the best of all world. While the new club has done away with the map that guided you to the drink that best suits your taste, the bartenders will do a great job of suggesting one to you. So don't be afraid to ask!A stellar restaurant and bar, now in an accesible neighbourhood. Just go."

Location is pretty easy to get to via MRT or Grab.Pre-ordered the Peking Duck and it was brought to be cut tableside! The wait staff even offered to wrap the duck for us! The second course was the duck lettuce wraps which were decent. The crispy noodles on the bottom made this a contrasting dish.The BBQ pork appetizer was so-so whereas the roasted pork belly was quite tasty.The wasabi prawns were probably the highlight of the evening as they were pretty decent sized and the wasabi had a nice kick to it!The Black pepper beef cubes were very tender and delicious, as were the stir-fried green beans.

We ordered a duck to be split between the two of us (as you cannot order a half duck), which turned out into a real duck fest.The Peking duck is sliced in front of you, you get to eat the crispy skin first, then the traditional Peking pancake way and afterwards they offer to cook up the leftovers as you wish: we opted for the fried rice. These three preparations were much more than we could eat but fortunately they offered to wrap them up neatly so we could feast on them again.It is a tad on the pricey side but the service is good and the duck is probably one of the better duck dishes to be found in Singapore.Would I go again? Yes - I might try the outlet at Paragon next time as it is more popular (so even better?)"

You can't order half a duck. Those are their rules, which suits me fine as I will happily make a meal with my partner of just Peking duck and duck part 2 and we will be content. They serve it with flour pancakes over those skimpy and bleh 'egg' pancakes, which is just plain wrong. Your second dish with the remaining duck meat can be a few choices: rice, lettuce wrapped, deep fried with the bones and other options. We usually chose flat rice noodle, dry, with shredded duck meat. Delectable. At this location, it's a business crowd at lunch. In the evenings a mix of patrons dine here. I like avoiding the much busier Paragon location. Service here like most Imperial Treasure locations is attentive. Grab a booth if you can for a more relaxed dining experience. Highly recommended for when you have that Peking duck craving."

For the G&T, we picked a Japanese gin, and the guy who made it up added some citrus things. Given how expensive alcohol, especially liquor, is in Singapore, this definitely makes the price seem acceptable. I was so so happy with the seafood station, and the stations with the Asian/Indian food. The king crab, tuna, and salmon, duck, scallop dumplings, the satays  The highlight would have to be the generous amount of seared foie gras that was served over churros. Mind-blowing. The reason this gets 4 stars is because some of grilled meat options were meh - the wagyu beef and lamb could be better. But then the dessert section ended it strong. The macaroons were memorable.

I don't think it was outstanding in any of the criteria we judge buffets by: quantity, quality, variety, and service - but it's good enough to return to, just to differentiate itself from the main players (to my mind: melt, the line, and straits kitchen).they have the usual roundup of local food, japanese sushi and sashimi (the latter is good and very generous - ask for the salmon belly, which is available via request and not on display). the cold seafood seems serviceable (they have oysters and crab legs, which I know many people are into), but my favorite was definitely the prime roast - pink, tender, and full of flavour. pity they don't serve au jus.I also want to warn you that their so-named barbecue is in fact an indoor table-top grill, where you place your orders for various cuts of meat. not what I'd named a barbecue (and I'll refrain from judging this insidious clever marketing) - and also not very good. highly by-passable.there's a good spread of dessert, with a chocolate fountain, artisan-looking chocolates, and pretty cakes. skip the waffles though - anaemic, and rather biscuity, these are serviceable only with the ice cream.not bad enough to warn against - but if you're into stuffing your face, I'd recommend you to melt (still my favorite) and the line (which is an oldie but decent-ee)."

I think there was way too much food to try, and not enough tummy space. If you are looking for a good spread for dessert, this is not your place. It's more of a main course kind of place.I came here for dinner. They had an impressive spread of seafood, including lobsters. There was an array of Indian foods, which were quite good, and Chinese food (I liked the soup), Western styled dishes, and grill etc. I can't quite remember everything. Everything was cooked well. My only issue is that you can try maybe one bite of half the items, and you're done with dinner. I think I would have been happier with a smaller spread with a smaller price tag.Lastly, we came here for work with a guest. Their credit card machine was not working, and they asked us to wait a little while they rebooted. We ended up waiting for 30 min, which was really embarrassing. I think they should have let us pay at the next door restaurant, or use the credit card machine at the reception. Given the size of the bill, there was no way we could have carried enough cash to pay for it, but that way the only option we were given for payment.-------------Update: March 25, 2017We are doing a buffet tour of Singapore, and came back to the Edge for lunch last weekend. Lunch price was $48, but we used a UOB credit card for a 20% discount. I think they have restructured the buffet because I recall it used to be more expensive (although I checked during the holidays, so there might have been additional charges). I believe the addition of local delights means that the food is cheaper to make, so they were able to reduce the price and still please the crowd. I was here for dinner the last time, so I can't tell exactly what was changed because of the meal, and what was changed to deal with the price. The grill station is gone. They had a teh tarik station. There was a pizza station, a pasta station, kueh pie ti station, Indian, and local/Chinese station. There was chilled seafood (mussels and prawns), and sashimi. There was a fried banana station, and maybe a kaya toast station (although I didn't see anyone get it), and a bunch of local kuehs at another station. Yeah, they definitely replaced a few things.The dessert station is improved since the last time I was here. I particularly liked their ice cream -- they had 5 flavors. There was a yuzu sorbet, a blueberry yogurt, Thai milk tea, and matcha, and I can't remember the last one. I didn't like the yuzu. The blueberry yogurt was okay. I liked their Thai milk tea ice cream. The waffles were pre-made, and red velvet flavored only. I skipped that. The cakes didn't blow my mind. They had a bunch of kuehs, and Portuguese egg tarts.  With the change in the variety of food, I think the buffet is now better value (less variety, but also lower priced). I think the quality of the food wasn't spectacular, but acceptable. I might bump this to 3.5 stars."

My review is based on service during breakfast hour, as breakfast was included with my stay. Similar to other hotels in Singapore catering to international travelers, edge offers diners plenty of choices during breakfast service. All stations are buffet-style, serving foods common in Europe/American (sweet pastry, croissants, baked beans, eggs, bacon & sausage, etc.), to Asia (congee, dim sum, noodles soup, fried noodles, fried rice, naan, yogurt, sushi, etc.) to deli & cheese station, fresh fruit station (pineapple, watermelon, papaya, dragon fruits). They also have a couple stations offering cook-to-order dishes, like omelettes, or fish-ball or wonton noodle soup. The servers are fairly attentive in clearing the empty plate and refilling tea or coffee. But they're not overly intrusive (i was able to enjoy my meal without being interrupted every 5 min). I think for juices, you have to full those yourself at that juice station. You gets a small orange/black card on the table that tells the staff whether you  just getting more food or you're done. So you don't have to worry about someone accidentally clearing you table.As mentioned my breakfast was included with my stay, so I don't know how much breakfast is at the edge. That said, food was good, service was good... If I have to pay out of pocket, I would prob pay around $25SGD... Simply because there are a lot of local places you can find similar food for less money, though may not be at one convenient location. Or you have a huge appetite that you require buffet-style feeding. :)"

Even as you walk in, the ambience is wonderful, with a spacious seating plan. There's a selection of window seating, booths and regular restaurant seating available, with the food stations spaced out rather evenly throughout the restaurant. There's a large selection of cuisines available, with a small variety of dishes representing each cuisine. Unlike other buffets, these dishes are prepared in small quantities to ensure the quality and freshness of each dish. There's also an absolutely wonderful selection of fresh in-season fruits, cheeses and desserts - I highly recommend the red wine chocolate! Service by the staff was also pretty good - there were smiles all around. My brother also managed to get a birthday candle for the slice of cheesecake he picked up from the dessert counter which he had decorated with more chocolates from the counter (it was my birthday).

We made a reservation last Feb at BRK to celebrate an engagement this June. Communication with BRK prior to our arrival has been via email and they were responsive and helpful. On the day of our celebration, we were seated in the area behind the noodles station next to the bar. we had the entire space there and it felt like we had the whole place. The space was beautiful. We had 9 folks around a large table and another table of 6 off to the side. The smaller table was intimate. The large table was comfortable. It was a huge table so trying to have a conversation across the table is not recommended. Plan your seating chart well. It worked out for us. Food is delicious! There is a huge spread of food from seafood to grill to local delicacies like hainanese chicken rice. Plan your trips well. I think it is impossible to sample everything BRK has to offer but I'm sure they have something for your craving when you get there. Chili crab? Black vinegar trotters? Grilled pork? Noodles? Razor clams? Fresh oysters? They have it all. I did not eat every item available but our group of 14 came close. Mathan and his team including Jane was very attentive. Mathan offered to bring grilled fishes to the table to save us waiting. At the end of our meal, mathan and Jane brought out a cake with a candle on it for the couple. That's so thoughtful. I would recommend Beach Road Kitchen to anyone looking for a buffet meal anytime in a nice part of town."

Like many spots in CBD, The Black Swan is quite a fancy. Right when you walk in, it almost feels like you're walking in to a 5-star hotel especially with its elegant furniture, extravagant interior and semi-dimmed lighting. But when you go to the Powder Room, it feels like you just walk in to a ballin speakeasy. The room is pretty dark and has nice velvet couches, perfect for a more intimate setting.I've only come here for their Happy Hour menu and had their $2 oysters, truffle fries, calamari, and sliders. For the most part, I thought their bar food was quite decent especially for the price. The $2 oysters were always a huge hit in my book. Happy hour prices on wine and beer are pretty similar to most places but with its very sophisticated atmosphere, I feel like the happy hour drinks are more worth it here compared to other places in CBD. Place gets packed pretty fast so highly do recommend calling beforehand to make a reservation (especially if you want to be in the Powder Room). Service is pretty top notch as well. I've come here close to when HH was ending and the server still let me place my order and wasn't stingy about it. There was another time where one of the servers let me charge my phone by where the sound booth was."

It's located in a building with a rounded wall entrance and is pretty easy to spot. It also had a roaring 20's vibe, similar to 28 Hong  Kong and it's servers were rocking dresses and pearls. The menu had a wide variety of options and would be great for a group of friends with diverse tastes. We started with the artichokes and bacon. It wasn't what I expected because the artichokes looked more like potatoes. The side is pretty hearty (pun intended) and is a good dish to share.I ordered the burger medium with no bun or cheese and cheated with the fries. It was cooked perfectly and ranks high on my list for burgers in Singapore, as I've found a good one hard to come by.Hubby ordered the pork chop and we split meals. Best of both worlds! It was prepared well--not to dry. The apple sides were delicious and the portion sizes were good.I was also very pleased with the service. Definitely worth checking out."

Think fine European classic dishes served in an equally classy and Art Deco building (The Quadrant) at Cecil Street. What i hear is that the bar is rather spectacular for an after work drink but don't miss out on their food! The Black Swan recently updated their menu and it now features classics such as Chicken Velouté, Steak Tartare, and Duck Leg Confit We hear that the Head Chef watches his team like a hawk to ensure the traditional preparation of these dishes are adhered to. Starting with the Raw Bar, the Black Swan Seafood Platter ($148) is a good starter to go with the selection of martinis and cocktails with its mix of Alaskan king crab, oysters, Maine lobster, Obsiblue prawns, Uni, and clam ceviche.If hot is more your thing, then pick some from the Small Plates selection. I highly recommend the Chicken Velouté ($18), a comforting and luscious soup of poached chicken chunks, fried maitake mushroom, and Pain de aisses.The Steak Tartare ($26) uses coarsely chopped beef from USDA 365-day grain-fed cows and is served in a tangy bbq/ketchup and mustard marinate. This is more American than European i think but yummy nonetheless. Great with the toasted bread! Alaskan Snow Crab Salad ($24) features generous chunks of briny snow crab. This was a refreshing dish with the avocado, mango, orange, grapefruit, and citrus vinaigrette mix.Bigger plates will fill you up. If you're coming in a big group, i'd highly recommend that you make an 2 days advanced booking for the Roasted Suckling Pig ($148). Only baby  Spanish  pigs are used here and the tender meat is brined for 24 hours, marinated with herbs and then sous-vide for 6 to 8 hours before being roasted to crisp perfection. Love love love this and the tangy pickled vegetables that accompanies it.The Black Swan also has daily specials, which give you more reasons to come back every day of the week. Monday Special is the Tournedos Rossini ($50) which is a glorious 150g tenderloin topped with seared foie gras. Real truffle sauce with shaved truffles accompanies this decadent dish. We thought this dish tasted quite Asian due to the use of peppers as part of the bed of sautéed vegetables. I wouldn't miss the Thursday Special, which is the Lobster Thermidor ($65). Yummiest whole Maine lobster, flesh removed and diced, then mixed with Mornay sauce, gruyère cheese, and baked in the shell. Comes with fries too. Apparently you can switch it to truffle fries without extra charge. I may have been drunk by then so i can't be exactly sure if i heard it right. HAHA.Desserts are a must! The Black Swan Fireball ($22) is set ablaze tableside with Grand Marnier, the decadent chocolate sphere melts to reveal a tempting centre of vanilla ice cream sitting atop a tangy berries compote and crunchy chocolate pearls. Full of theatrics i must say but it was fun and tasty too.If you're for a more standard dessert, the Dark Chocolate Dome ($16) of Valrhona Guanaja, Vanilla crème, and seasonal berries would suffice.Back to drinks. Wine and Dine with with Bar Manager Gerardo Callipo, who will come around with his martini trolley. Cocktails are prepared tableside and we had more smoke and fire to round up the night. Don't miss the interesting The Black Cow cocktail which is a vodka made from milk. This is served with an English Cheddar cheese that is also produced from the same milk.Powder My Nose ($19) is a lady pleaser. Yummy mix of salted caramel vodka and apple juice, passion fruit and hints of mint. Sweet dreams are made of this!B.B.King ($19) is a spicy banana-infused whisky with smoked maple syrup, barbecue bitters and a little sorbet made from banana that has been soaked in the whisky! This was kinda spicy for me though. Coffee lovers would dig the Café Royale ($19). I can't say no to espresso, especially when paired with a salted caramel vodka. The vanilla and cinnamon foam was turned into ice cream with the liquid nitrogen. Woot woot!The current Happy Hour Menu is available from 5-8pm on weekdays, with the offer of $21 for a glass of champagne and a pair of freshly-shucked oysters. Coming up in December, the Happy Hour Menu will be replaced with a $2 menu for oysters, and $11 for selected beer, wine and house-pours. More reasons to come back to The Black Swan!"

It has plenty of space inside and they have made a good job of creating a pleasant environment to have drinks in. Despite it being busy I was pleasantly surprised that we were promptly seated and handed menus and the staff also made sure to keep an eye on us and were there right when we were ready to order. The cocktail list was pretty interesting but perhaps a bit too much fruit and sweet to me but sampled the Good Night Good Luck and it was not at all bad and price level at 19 SGD is a bit lower than many other places. All in all good and I would not hesitate to visit again but it also failed to excite me.

I made a reservation on chope's website and as I wasn't sure if they had received my reservation I did the typically 'kiasu' Singaporean thing and texted the restaurant's direct reservation hotline. I also asked if they can prepare a surprise birthday cake for my partner. I got a reply call within 5 minutes of me sending the text which left me dumbfounded - the waitress was polite, accommodating and warm. What was great was that instead of replying with a text, they replied with a personalized call instead. Two thumbs up! Somehow, I wasn't able to find the place easily, coming out of the wrong end of Raffles Place MRT and I called the restaurant to ask for specific directions. I was given clear directions and my call was given a warm reception. Upon arrival, we were expected (I guess from my call) and was ushered to our seat. The waitress was knowledgeable and gave us excellent recommendations on food choices. We ordered starters of Crab Salad, The Black Swan Burger (for me), Duck Leg Confit (for him) and a glass of Silver Lining to share.Verdict:- Crab Salad ($21) - Generous servings of crab sprinkled amongst bits of avocado, mango and orange. The entire dish was doused in a sweet, zesty citrus vinaigrette which provides a lip-smacking finish.- The Black Swan Burger ($26) - A juicy, tender and thick beef patty checked all the boxes for me as a self-declared beef-tarian. Combined with melted cheddar, eggs, bacon and lettuce, it's all I want in a good burger. The fries on the side were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - just how fries should be.- Duck Leg Confit ($36) - Apparently this dish was cooked for 36 hours (or so it says on the menu description). Evidence of this can be seen where the soft duck meat literally falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The addition of fresh thyme provides a refreshing, minty lift to the entire dish. From time to time, our waitress would check in with us and asked if we needed any thing. I thought this was a good touch but she wasn't intrusive at all. Some might not appreciate this service (especially in Singapore), but we liked it.At the end of the meal, my partner was given a surprise (to him) birthday Chocolate Lava Cake on the house. Prior to that, I told them I wanted to prepare a secret birthday surprise for him and given them his name. The result was lovely! Some of the servers came over and sang a birthday song, to his embarrassment.I guess the hubbub of the place was about how Gatsby-esque it was but to me it was incomparable to the food and service.Tip: If you are hoping for a really quiet, romantic dinner place, skip this place. It could get a tad noisy from 7pm - 8pm from the happy hour crowd seated at the nearby bar. The noise, however, died down from 8.30pm onwards.Otherwise, please do make a reservation and try out this place!"

But the hubbub was largely about the concept and the design, two things that were a complete letdown.The place is supposed to be modelled on Gatsby but I saw no Gatsby elements here. What primarily struck me was the aircraft hangar size of the establishment, the relatively impersonal service, the typical office-worker clientele and the total lack of character and heart.

I asked the waiter about seeing what they can do to find out if I can watch the football game later. After awhile, we got ASN on the flatscreen! Woot!

Both levels have big, flat screen TV's that are placed strategically so no matter where you are, you can get good views of whatever's going on.Admittedly, I've really only come here for sports, not for food. Earlier this year, I was here for the Super Bowl, and most recently I came with the intention of watching the practice rounds for Formula 1, only to discover that none of the channels were providing live coverage. (D'oh!) Downstairs, there's lots of seating and outside they have small tables where you can congregate with your drinks for happy hour. It can get really hot, though, so definitely ask for a table upstairs if you want air conditioning and less noise.This is an all day dining concept, so I've tried their breakfast and some snacks. I found their French toast a bit too sweet, but well portioned. Coffees were okay, nothing to Yelp about. For happy hour, their wine is affordably priced per glass, and my hummus plate was decent at $10.Though I can't speak for their main courses, I've been pretty happy with their space and location. Definitely a great gathering for groups to watch popular sporting events and get bar bites."

I got the Premium Slider, the Steak Aussie slider. My friend got the Wagyu Beef burger. My sliders came with three and it was $25. It didn't even come with fries. It definitely was not filling enough, so you needed fries. Maybe somewhere in Los Angeles, sliders could be worth $25. Then if you thought $25 wasn't so bad because you don't really have to pay tax or tip in Singapore. You're wrong. They charged a 10% fee plus another 7% fee. I ended up paying $44 for 3 small sliders and a $12 beer. It was definitely not worth it. The 4.5 stars this place has is definitely not worth it."

This place has some limited seating, but located inside the Marina Bay Link Mall, it is designed as more of a grab and go for the working peeps of the Singapore financial district. The blue forms at the counter are for a bowl and the yellow forms are for a burrito (do you like to eat your poke with a fork or your fists!).  The form is easy to complete as you are standing in line.  It took maybe 5 minutes for them to put it together once they took my order and I paid. $11.90SGD for 75g, $15.90SGD for 150g (two scoops), $19.90SGD for 225g (three scoops).  Some add ons, like kale or additional items are at an additional charge, usually between $.50 to $1.00SGD.  I particularly like the kale add on option for $1SGD. So I think I might already be hooked.  A 4 on Yelp leaves room for improvement, but based on my first visit, I am not disappointed and will absolutely be back.  And hey, they have a loyalty card too...buy 10 bowls or burritos and get one for free!  I like that they want me back and my loyalty!"

That works out great for me since I do like to feast on all things from the sea. Starting out with sashimi, oysters, scallops, mussels, crab legs, and octopus from the raw bar, it was the perfect way to start the gluttonous meal when paired with Mediterranean mezze and fresh salad. A variety of global cuisine in the hot section including local faves like black pepper crab and roast duck to Indian Kerela fish curry to Spanish paella and slices of prime rib. All decent but not necessarily memorable. I stuck with the raw bar more. Some desserts to cap off the meal. I was unimpressed with the pastries but thankfully the  fresh fruits like mango and dragon fruit plus zesty sorbets ended the meal on the right note. Service was attentive and friendly. Asked to be seated deeper inside the restaurant if the night is a romantic affair as it's dimmer and away from the tourists visiting MBS.

I tried a few dealer and I think the small plate of creme brûlée is the most appetising. The pudding like cocktail is good too with longan, blueberry and strawberry. Gelato sorbet - mango and strawberry is good too. Overall I still into the desserts here than the main course.Parking- you can park at the hotel or the shoppes area.

Meaning, if you want to grab a late lunch or an early dinner this restaurant is available. In terms of food, thought this restaurant has Thai in its name, don't let that fool you. Yes, they offer Thai food but they also have so much more. In fact, they have a great selection of dishes, all of which are very good. Pretty much anybody can find sometime that they will like. They, of course, offer various beers and wines, and other fun non-alcohol drinks. In terms of lay out, this is predominately an outdoor restaurant. My suggestion is to get a table right on the river as this makes the whole dining experience so much more scenic. They also have an interior space but this area functions more as a bar and less as a restaurant. The staff here is very nice and the food is very good.

The meats are fresh and well marinated, and they provide leaves and raw garlic to wrap your meats with. We ordered a variety of beef and chicken and everything was tender and delicious. They also pour beat up eggs down the ridges of the grill so you get to eat some soft fluffy egg if you're starving or waiting for the meat to cook. We also ordered a seafood pancake, which was gigantic and great for sharing. Their spicy soup was also very tasty.As a minor note, the tea tasted like water.

Since returning from the US, where Korean food is surprisingly popular and extremely spicy and usually authentic, I've dragged numerous friend-groups to fulfil my Korean cravings (esp as the bf does not like spicy foods, so he's a work-in-progress). This place meets my criteria for good Korean food: 1) good banchan/side dishes. i.e. lethal kimchi, good variety, preferably includes jap chae but if not it's okay. none of those wilted, pathetic cabbages or musty tasting green veggies2) dense, rich, authentic soups with real SPICE 3) affordable, so there's none of that guilt from overspending on a single mealWe came here for lunch on a weekday, to find maybe 60% of the restaurant full? Pretty good considering the Telok Ayer idea is somehow oversaturated with various seemingly indistinguishable Korean eateries. The lunch menu ranged from $8-$20+, including free flow of quality side dishes. My friend ordered ginseng chicken soup - I didn't try, but it didn't include white rice since the server pointed out there was glutinous rice inside, which struck me as a little odd. My friend enjoyed it though. We shared the pork & ham spicy soup ($36 for 2-3 pax), which was really kimchi jigae, since it included pork, sausages, spam, some rice cakes, onions, fish cakes, and one serving of instant noodles. It came on a small stove and I just love the smell of bubbling hot soup. It wasn't really spicy though, and there were too many beans inside to thicken the soup. I wish there were more non-processed meats like porks, too. We also ordered a top-up of the soup for $3, which was yummy! The soup was decent and hit the spot, but I do also wish it had a meatier/richer taste besides just kimchi/spiciness. What I'm saying in a roundabout way is that it met the bar for a good kimchi jigae, but I wish it were a more complex dish. Such a great price though. Another important thing to note was that the servers were incredibly patient and quick. Since we (or more accurately, my friends) are college students/soon-to-be graduates that have yet to internalize the value of punctuality, my friend waited inside 20 minutes for two of us to arrive together, and then we waited another 5-10 minutes for our last friend before ordering. We never felt rushed throughout that, unlike how I've been treated at other restaurants when I'm the first to arrive. I'm already making plans to head there next week with another friend working around the Telok Ayer area, and foresee myself heading back there again, maybe for the bbq next time!"

Every friggin' person at DB Bistro was on point: the bartender, the hostess, the server bringing my food, the manager: all of them were friendly, chatty, pro-active and helpful. Take note, all other restaurants: this is how it should be! I have noticed that often restaurants serve subpar dishes during restaurant week, not DB Bistro! The dishes were also listed on their regular menu and were just great. I've said it before and I will say it again: simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication! I love innovation but a classic is often a classic for a reason and when it is executed well, it is hard to beat. I started with the Kale Caesar Salad: I will definitely be back for this, it was one of the best salads I had in Singapore. The dressing was in perfect ratio to the salad and the anchovies gave it that typical Caesar flavor.  The slow-cooked salmon showed great skill, in my opinion it was cooked just right! The dessert was another hit: the Molten Chocolate cake with the salted caramel sauce was pure indulgence.And this is not where the praise stops: the cocktail, recommended by the bartender, was simply amazing! I guess the only negative thing I can say about DB Bistro is that I ate way too much and that this experience spoiled many other restaurants for me as it will be hard to find somewhere in Singapore which matches the service and food of DB Bistro.In short: Awesome food, awesome service... they'll see me back at DB Bistro."

The Boulud name raised my expectations so it could only disappoint from there...which it unfortunately did. Whilst service was prompt and ninja-like, and ambience was very nice, the all-important food was a major let down. Especially considering we ordered the signature dish!We had: a DB burger and salmon tartare to share as we had only eaten brunch 90mins before. The DB burger was ordered medium but came out VERY pink. The foie gras inside was barely noticeable and made zero impact or difference to the burger. Whilst the texture of the burger was good, it was woefully under-seasoned and thus lacked any flavour. More salt would've probably helped bring out the flavour of the quality beef. A few miserable slivers of onion (for $50 a burger couldn't they have at least caramelised them?) and lettuce were scattered inside, along with a smear of mustard and ketchup. The parmesan bun was also totally underwhelming. $44++ is massively overpriced for a burger that would've been beaten in a blind taste test by Shake Shack or Omakase. On the plus side, the chips / French fries were excellent! Salmon tartare was very small and not at all worth the $22++ ...portion essentially what you'd get if it was served in a martini glass. Again under seasoned and lacking any real character. Even the bread basket they served us was disappointing, with bread that had the texture of being cut and out in the air for a few hours. Overall for what was essentially a meal for one, we paid $77 and didn't even order a drink. Don't be sucked in by the celebrity name, the food is far from what the price tag leads you to expect."

When I first moved to Singapore, I wanted to take myself out to a nice place after my I closed my first deal at work, and knew there were some celebrity restaurants in the MBS. Being that I was flying solo for this dinner, I knew I wanted somewhere that I would feel comfortable sitting at the bar alone, and somewhere that had killer cocktails and amazing food.  DB had it all.  I was immediately sat at the bar, the bartender (I wish I could remember his name) was chatty but not annoying, and made his recommendations, and the service was excellent.  I had the lychee martini, some killer oysters, the salmon and the molten chocolate cake.  Everything was excellent.  Since then, I've been back about 4 times, I take clients there, I took my friends who were visiting from the US and have gone back on my own.  Each time the bartender remembers me and my name and always makes a point to say hello, which I think is a nice touch.  I've had everything from their lobster to the steak to the pasta and everything is good.  If you are looking for a special occasion place, date night, client dinner or lunch, or place to sit at the bar and enjoy some me time, DB Bistro is the place to be.

And I loved some of the food but it did definitely fall short of expectations.First, let me say that the service here is excellent. Definitely the best I experienced in Singapore...and I sat at the bar.I ordered a burger and french onion soup to start. The French Onion Soup was very good, though quite pricey, but definitely the best french onion soup I ever had, unfortunately though that wasn't what  I really wanted. I came here for the burger, and the reason dB Bistro Moderne is only getting three stars instead of four or five.The burger had quite a burnt tast, and I ordered medium. The beef didn't seem to be of a high quality, which is disappointing as I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on it. The bun was soaked and surprisingly depressing. If only they knew how to keep the bun dry. I ordered the Yankee Burger and really don't have anything positive to say about it. I'd take a Carl's Jr. Six Dollar burger over this any day of the week...and it's a third of the price. I really want to try this place again since the French Onion soup was so good and the bartender hooked me up with free Madeleine's, which were fresh and very buttery. Next time I'm in Singapore I'll be back here, and hopefully I get more of the French Onion Soup, awesome Madeleines and great service, and less of the horribly overrated disgusting burger."

The Boulud name raised my expectations so it could only disappoint from there...which it unfortunately did. Whilst service was prompt and ninja-like, and ambience was very nice, the all-important food was a major let down. Especially considering we ordered the signature dish!We had: a DB burger and salmon tartare to share as we had only eaten brunch 90mins before. The DB burger was ordered medium but came out VERY pink. The foie gras inside was barely noticeable and made zero impact or difference to the burger. Whilst the texture of the burger was good, it was woefully under-seasoned and thus lacked any flavour. More salt would've probably helped bring out the flavour of the quality beef. A few miserable slivers of onion (for $50 a burger couldn't they have at least caramelised them?) and lettuce were scattered inside, along with a smear of mustard and ketchup. The parmesan bun was also totally underwhelming. $44++ is massively overpriced for a burger that would've been beaten in a blind taste test by Shake Shack or Omakase. On the plus side, the chips / French fries were excellent! Salmon tartare was very small and not at all worth the $22++ ...portion essentially what you'd get if it was served in a martini glass. Again under seasoned and lacking any real character. Even the bread basket they served us was disappointing, with bread that had the texture of being cut and out in the air for a few hours. Overall for what was essentially a meal for one, we paid $77 and didn't even order a drink. Don't be sucked in by the celebrity name, the food is far from what the price tag leads you to expect."

Came out to Marina Bay Sands for the SG50 food festival. The event was packed (seemed to capacity) and soooo very hot. I lasted all of 15 minutes outside  before I called it quits and decided to enter the MBS mall. Of course, the mall was packed too. Decided on French food for lunch, got in the queue for db Bistro, and after a ten minute wait...we were in. Looking over the menu I realized I was, duh, in a Daniel Boulud restaurant...oh, db! Score! Lovely dining room. Much more elegant and modern than a French Bistro but not stuffy. Another positive, although the restaurant was full, I was able to hold a conversation with my table mate with no problem. The staff was very efficient, our server very helpful.  For such a busy day, our food came out rather quickly. That was a nice surprise.I started off with a db signature Bloody Mary, it's a meal! The drink included: a skewer of prawn, ham, pickled veggies, and a the all important stalk of celery.To go with the Bloody Mary, I ordered French fries with three dipping sauces. Yum. And a lovely chilled lobster salad. Taste was Meh. I should of stopped at the drink and fries because the salad was really boring. The person I was dining with ordered the New England casserole and he really enjoyed every bite. The casserole was loaded with: mussels, clams, shrimp, fennel sausage, and corn. And it came with two generous chunks of toasted garlic bread. So a score there.Three and a half stars. All in all, just an okay experience. I know, I know, it is a Daniel Boulud restaurant. But I am pretty sure he was nowhere in sight this Sunday afternoon. Other than a celebrity chef name and prices to match, there is nothing to compel me to return to this restaurant. At this price range,  there are many more restaurants I would rather visit upon my return to the MBS mall."

This date only came to our attention while we already sitting in the DB Bistro Moderne. We could not have chosen a better place to celebrate. After a long thirsty afternoon walking around the city, we ended up at MBS. It's hard to select a place to eat in this are due to all of the many and high end gourmet restaurants in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, but we checked a couple of reviews on Yelp and decided that DB was the place of choice. We got a table without a reservation without a problem, ordered two iceberg lettuce salads, a DB burger and some French Onion soup. Drinks were a Brewerkz Pale Ale and a mint, lime and ginger lemonade. The service was very good, it was very friendly and a casual glance at our fellow diners indicated people were really enjoying themselves. The bread they brought out before the salad, was great, but then the salads arrived. Wow. The lettuce was very fresh, crunchy and not too big (being a confirmed carnivore, I tolerate salads, just) the blue cheese dressing with bacon bits added had great flavors. , and before we knew it they were gone. My wife was not as hungry as I was, so she ordered the French Onion soup. It arrived complete with the Gruyere cheese melted and floating on the top. Taste was wonderful. My DB burger was stuffed with short ribs and foie gras. I had never tasted foie gras before and despite some countries banning it, I decided to give it a try. The burger was cooked to perfection, medium, just like I had ordered. The short ribs and Foie Gras were spectacular. The French fries tasty, with a portion size that was the right side of ""not too big"". Washed down with the Pale ale from Brewerkz it really did hit the spot. Can you say that a $42 burger is good value? Maybe not but the taste was truly exceptional. We let the food settle and followed it with some excellent coffee. It was a great experience here."

With a testimonial like that, it's hard for us burger fans to resist. We loved the gougères with grated Gruyère cheese and Basque pepper Piment d'Espelette ... it was so addictive we could have eaten a dozen of them easily. The bread platter had a good selection of different types of bread. We had the foie gras terrine with quince ... it was a bit too rich and heavy for me but otherwise smooth and creamy. I had the steak frites which came as a nicely pink and juicy sirloin but personally I prefer the fattier ribeye cut. The fries were pretty awesome though.

At 57, he is a well established celebrity chef who owns many high rating restaurants in the West. Born in France and culinary trained by notable French chefs, he emerged as a rising star, marked with many awards. His fame continue to rise after his NY restaurant; Daniel receives the most prestigious rating and becomes - Michelin 3-star restaurant. Daniel is well-known for his traditional French cooking with a touch of modern American flavor (This speaks well for the attention he receives in New York, he clearly understood what appeals and suits the Americans with a twist).    The restaurant is located at basement 1 of  Marina Bay Sands- a luxurious integrated resort with a world-class casino and famous Sands Skypark. It is easily accessible by public transports; where the most convenient way of getting there by Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), alighting at Bayfront station. One should spot the restaurant effortlessly as it lies just opposite Grand Theater's ticketing counter.    Arriving at 4ish in the afternoon, the restaurant was only 15% filled with diners, probably due to brunch hours. With my reservation, I was being ushered politely to a leathery rosso dining banquette. The bistro looks elegant, dressed up in stylish hanging globes across the ceiling. To me, it was all sexy and chic and thanks to Jeffrey Beers, the Architect and Interior Designer. The ambiance was laid back but not on the service. The main courses were served in 25mins after they have been placed. First came the Coq au vin; braised chicken cooked with wine, wild mushrooms, pearl onions, few stripes of pork belly and most notable lardons. The späetzle (a form of egg noodles but small button-shaped)  was served alongside in a iron cast dishware. The dish looks attempting and it gives off an exhilarating winy aroma. I immediately helped myself with the chicken thigh (it came with 2 drumsticks and a thigh) and it was all comforting. The thigh was well soaked with the thickened wine juices, leaving the skin jelly-liked. However, the meat was a bit tough and chewy. Unfortunately, the drumsticks taste similar, I'd believe it shouldn't have happened on drumsticks. I am puzzled over the meat texture, even until now. On the brighter side, the thickened gravy was heavenly and you ought to drizzle it over those späetzle to enjoy, it mustn't be wasted. The pearl onions were sweet & so fresh that they were all crunchy at each bite! The barely noticeable stripped pork belly and cubed mushrooms were thoroughly braised and yummy. I smiled at those lardon bits that made the dish taste even better just like seeing a plate of Char Kway Teow sprinkled generously with lardons, full of guilt but gratifying.   While feeling a little upset over the chicken meat, I am so delighted that I am right about Fried Eggs Lyonnaises! The ""not-so-popular"" egg dish was a surprise. I am amazed that the duck confit was so well done that it was so soft and delicate (the fact that the duck meat was even tender than coq au vin's chicken drumsticks, makes me felt worst over it) and the caramelized onions add an extra sweetness to the meat. It was not gamey at all! The cubed potatoes embedded underneath the layer of cheese were equally delicious.Not to be missed - db's desserts! I have a soft spot for desserts and their Warm Madeleines were to die-for! The 20 petit cakes wrapped in linen for warmth, appeared ballooning and lip-smacking. Each was light and spongy. The center was air-filled with a pronounced lemony taste. It was delectable on its own, even without the capped icing dust. It was definitely a highlight on the dessert menu.I confessed, being gluttony, I could not stop at only 1 dessert. I'd to have another when some new flavors caught my eyes. I decided on something more; a scoop of Cherry Blossom ice-cream and another Honey-Buttermilk sorbet. The cherry blossom ice cream was pretty-looking, bright and pinky. It has a tangy taste but nothing flowery. I figured it was more of a cherry flavor while naming it blossom to make it sound beautiful. On the other hand, the honey-buttermilk was nothing more than a sweet milk concoction without great distinction. In all, I am satisfied with db Bistro Moderne. The $100 bill is worth trying out a Michelin-3 star's cousin after all.Thanks to the Alsatian born chef; Stephane Istel who manned the stove at the MBS outlet, I had a memorable bistronomic affair altogether."

It came with a fair amount of garnish, and all of the components together with the foie tasted nice, but it was pretty typical. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but it was good.For mains me and my friend had the famous DB burger. The first few bites of it were exquisite. The flavorful patty, stuffed with foie gras and short ribs, was fantastic. It was juicy, well seasoned, and incredibly rich. The roll was a nice soft bun with just enough structure so it doesn't fall apart, and the lettuce and tomato served there purpose. The main problem was as good as those first bites were, after about half of the burger the richness becomes overwhelming. Between myself and a friend we could have split one burger and been content. It needed something to cut through the richness. The fries were pretty good; crispy yet fluffy - basically a typical restaurant style fry. Altogether though, $42 is way too much for a burger. I don't think I could justify getting this again.The service was good enough, though I do feel as the restaurant got a bit busier our table started to get ignored.

I'm not sure it was the best combinaton though - both the souffle and sorbet had muted profiles that disappeared into an indistinct nothingness when eaten together. his internationally-lauded madeleines were tiny little things nestled lovingly in a cloth basket and dusted with sugar - soft and cakey. I thought them a little one-dimensional though, and a tad too sweet without a cup of tea to wash down. it was a generous serving - far more than we could (or wanted to) eat at a single seating, so we doggy-bagged about half and ordered the hot chocolate fondant.a lava cake is so nineties, I know, but it doesn't stop me loving it. this was a decent rendition. I have a suspicion that the innards of the cake aren't uncooked cake batter - which drops it a couple points in my regard - but it was quite chocolatey and served with two scooops of delicious ice cream. so, decent desserts, though I would still pick the wolfgang puck establishment over this. the desserts here are a little lighter on the wallet, and the portions slightly more generous - which makes it a pretty good option if you're in the area."

Also never have I had a great burger in a place where they ask you how would you like your patty done, a burger patty is not a steak and since the chef has put together the offering the house should go with what they think goes best, they can have different burgers for those who like it rare v/s those who like it well done or since its a fine dining establishment have the option of accommodating the guest's request if the guest has a very particular way they want their burger...A meal with one of their basic burger with fries ( tad overdone) and a soda ( we had a mint lemonade, quite average) sets you back by $45 all inclusive not bad for a fine dining place with pretty good if a little over-whelming service...."

It reminds me of a typical higher end vegas hotel restaurant. The produce is good but the execution falls short. The lobster and foie gras and truffle that we had were really of good quality but they were just not cooked as perfectly as they should. We started out with the seared foie gras and lobster salad. The foie gras was a teeny bit overcooked, and slightly underseasoned.  It wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't overwhelmingly good for me. The lobster salad had a generous portion of chunky lobster meat, and the little gem lettuce was really fresh, but the french dressing was terrible. It tastes completely like thousand island dressing, and was way too heavy and creamy for the delicate lettuce and lobster meat, which was a shame. I had the boulebaisse for my main, which is a french seafood stew. I really liked the stock because I love lobster bisque, and it was rich and tasted like a good lobster bisque, with hints of sherry. The produce was okay, but the fish was very bland. My husband got the truffle homemade pasta with aged parmesan. We thought it would be a truffle-infused pasta, but it was normal pasta (homemade though) with some truffle slices on it. The aged parmesan sauce was a tad disappointing, and lacks the complexity and deepness of aged parmesan. It was an okay cheese sauce, but nothing to shout about. Service was decent and prompt though."

I had the seasonal fried oyster set meal, and for 16.90 you get rice and 4 huge oysters with two different sauces, cold tofu, a salad with yummy sesame dressing and miso soup. Besides the fact that it was a lot of food, the taste was excellent. The greens were fresh and the salad dressing was delicious. The rice (I'm particular about my rice) was fluffy and aromatic, and the oysters were big, fresh and fried just the right way. Crispy, but doesn't taste too oily, and with the tartare sauce, I was in heaven. The tofu and soup was alright, but in all, it was great. My friend's chicken katsu was as good, with the chicken still moist and the outside crispy and good. I am particular about fried oysters because I've been spoilt by the ones at saboten, but I have to say that this place is on par, and the menu is about 5x as extensive as saboten.

The dinner was a ~2.5 hour ""show"" with numerous courses with a different ""setting"" along with narrative by the staff during each course.The memories from the Chomp Chomp hawker center were excellent. All of the dishes were a premium version of what can be found locally. For example, the pratas featured super fragrant black truffles and the orh luak featured caviar. Flavors and textures were excellent.Moving on to the plates, this was also extremely well executed with high attention to detail. The crispy roast chicken rice was a stuffed chicken wing with black truffle. The kwai teow featured fish maw instead of noodles.The main course being a tribute to a local steakhouse was also extremely well executed. Opted for the ""regular"" 48 hour Angus shortrib and it was heavenly. Their shortrib had high levels of marbling and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The golden pompret was perfectly grilled and complemented this nicely with the white asparagus.The dessert courses were also an adventure. The shaved ice was a little too much for me although the cereal prawn and the kaya toast were definitely highlights to the meal!Meal ended off with a couple chocolate truffles to enjoy!~$302/ person after tax and service.

To capture the essence of Singapore's chili crab in an ice cream dish--fantastic! I have never had anything like that before.The most heart-touching dish was definitely the ""Tribute to Cairnhill Steakhouse"", a steakhouse that the Chef's grandfather owned. The meat was nothing special but the presentation was very honoring to his family.Last but not least was the Kaya toast with caviar.

The restaurant is located in the second floor of a mall and is a bit hard to find because there really is no signs anywhere with the location. Although it took a while to find I was delighted by the meal that I had.  Service here is top notch and the staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu.Food: 4.5 starsService: 4.5 starsEnvironment: 4 starsOverall: 4.25 starsStand outs: clay pot chicken rice, crystal de chine caviar, nippon koi farm silver perch I came here for lunch and was presented with either a five course or seven course menu. I choose the five course which is also the same menu as the pre theater menu. The meal starts off with a trio of snacks: tea egg, oyster takoyaki, and laksa mussel. All were quite nice and the mussel was my favorite of the three. The laksa broth paired with the mussel was really delicious. Following the snacks were four tapa sized main courses: barramundi crudo, tempura wild shrimp, silver perch, and clay pot chicken rice.  All were quite tasty and showed creativity. The ones I really enjoyed were the clay pot rice and the silver perch. The silver perch was cooked in banana leaf and paired with a light  kaffir leaf broth. The broth was really fantastic and I drank every drop of that soup. The clay pot chicken rice is right up my alley as it is very similar to the clay pot rice I grew up eating. This version takes it up to another level. The rice had a nice mixture of crispy bits with normal rice and the chicken was extremely tender and moist. The meal ends with two desserts. One was a clam leaf snow and the other was a play on kaya toast. The story behind the clam leaf made me enjoy the snow dish more than I normally would. Sorbet type desserts really aren't my favorite. The kaya toast however was really fantastic. At first glance the use of caviar in a dessert was odd. However, the salty caviar paired with sweetness of the ice cream and the crunch of the bread was a pairing that really worked. This will be the dish I will likely remember the most from my meal here."

Price: $140 fixed per person Which is steep for Singapore but I was ok with it as it has one Michelin star. Location: inside of a mediocre mall. HmmDecor: minimalistic. Some old school pillow at entrance with Chinese writing on it. Waiter attire: all black, a bit sluggish as the shirt was a bit wrinkled. (for those knows me, I have a thing with wrinkled shirt... Big nono)Food: overall was on the sweet side. I guess that's Singaporean food? Well, that could be subjective so I am not going to comment too much.Menu: they actually made a mistake on menu given out. There were two versions of menu which they acknowledged after we found out. No apologies or anything... and two different menus remains with the us on the table...Okay...At beginning, they asked if we have any allergies or any preferences on food. We said we don't eat lamb. After reading into menu, we also mentioned some of us don't eat Durian. Then comes the part annoys us. "" You must try it(Durian). It's like going to Europe and you gotta try goat cheese."" We told them that we have tried Durian before and some of us cannot stand the taste or smell of it so we request that they substitute it with something else or just don't serve it. THE WAITER REFUSED and insist that we must try it. Are you kidding me?When Durian dessert came, I mean I enjoy Durian myself and I can tell ya, it was a FULL ON Durian dessert from smell to taste. Moreover, the manager even came afterwards and was disappointed that not all of us ate the Durian. Talk about pushy and annoyance!!!We were quite annoyed that throughout the 15 course of meal as they wouldn't change our utensils! We would put our fork and knife inside the plate when we were done with each course then they will take utensils out and put on the white linen cloth so everyone gets dirty linen cloth. Seriously? Wow. After several course, you get how dirty it gets... Ugh I'm also use to having everyones course arrive all together . Nope, they serve one at a time ... After all 6 served then we gotta wait for them to explain the dish.. OK, you lose momentum and just not professional. When I'm traveling, I don't mind spend extra on food to have new experience but darn it, it sure wasnt a pleasant one especially I spent extra already. In this capital of food heaven, I don't see why anyone would want to spend their money here.The one absolute highlight of the dish was the quail leg: wow, that was nicely done in perfection. That's why I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1Ugh, I am still annoyed by the restaurant."

Indeed, the restaurant's dim lighting, minimalist decor and strategically placed spotlights were designed for diners to focus on its star dishes.Labyrinth's $178 tasting menu may seem steep considering the petite portions but with 16 courses, you do fill up nicely at the end of the meal. Although the dishes pay homage to Singapore's culinary heritage, expect creative tweaking here and there, this is a Michelin starred restaurant after all. Through picture cards placed on the table, Chef Han recounted interesting anecdotes, shared his culinary journey and personal memories. These wonderful notes allowed diners to follow each course with greater cognizance and to fully appreciate the inspirations behind the creative process. In addition, Labyrinth's efforts to work with local farms and suppliers is commendable, its tasting menu is a great platform to showcase quality local produce, artisanal goods including rare and exotic ingredients. I was very impressed with the creativity and ingenuity displayed throughout the meal. For example, we started off with ""Nasi Lemak"" Cheong Fun, a clever fusion of two iconic local dishes. Then there was a savoury LaLa Clam Tart with XO sambal and herbs, so pretty it could pass off as dessert. Labyrinth's Soy Bean Curd was notable for its unorthodox incorporation of yogurt (from goat's milk), sago pearls, caramelized sugar and bird's nest. These inclusions did not mar the dish. On the contrary, it enhanced the delicate flavour of the freshly made bean curd. On one or two occasions however, I did feel certain ingredients did not quite work together but on the whole there was brilliance in execution and presentation.Other exceptional dishes include :Labyrinth's Rojak, a charming assortment of flowers, herbs, sprouts, fruit and ground peanuts, was refreshing and extremely delish. Fried potato leaves and jackfruit sorbet gave this dish an unique appeal. ""Ang Moh"" Chicken Rice was presented unusually as a dumpling over a pool of white roux sauce. Within the bundle were tender morsels of braised chicken with chilli sauce, bringing forth the chicken rice flavours we know so well. This was another remarkable transformation of a local favourite. Local Wild Caught Crab was incredibly fresh and succulent. Served chilled, they paired perfectly with lightly fried egg white strips, a touch of Shaoxing wine and Labyrinth's signature chilli ice cream. An unconventional take on Singapore's beloved chilli crab dish.Uncle William's Quail was super tasty. The grilled quail legs and breast were well marinated with an in-house satay sauce with prominent accents of lemongrass. The accompanying satay gravy with ground peanuts was delicious, as were the innovative addition of soft chewy muah chee (sticky rice) cubes. Cristal de Chine Caviar had multiple layers of flavours and textures which came together in a phenomenal way. A scrumptious round of kaya ice cream with hints of gula jawa was sandwiched between 2 pieces of white toast. The latter having been caramelised, offering up a glazed sugary crust. This ice cream sandwich, which rested on a light bed of cereal powder, was garnished with a drizzle of egg yolk cured in light soy sauce. Last but not least there was the spoonful of caviar beautifully positioned atop the ice cream sandwich. What were normally breakfast items in Singapore metamorphosed into the most unexpectedly delightful dessert offering. Without a doubt, it was the fitting end to a rather surreal but positively unforgettable meal."

The savoury radish cake had a crispy edge and was very fragrant, it looked just like a toasty marshmallow. The next Amuse Bouche that we had was the most beautiful keropok / prawn crackers that was injected with squid ink. This keropok was topped with mayo chili and beautiful orange fish roe and edible flower petal. BAK CHOR MEEBak Chor Mee is a popular local dishes and I usually love the distinct flavour of the chili and sourness that comes from vinegar. The Neo-Sin's version was noodle created from the squid skin served together with anchovies in the shape of minced meat and Hokkaido Scallop that looks like a fish cake. It was a miniature version of Bak Chor Mee that you could find in the local street market. You need to mix everything together to get the best flavour. This cute looking Bak Chor Mee was served on a small bowl with rooster on it, a popular bowl that brought out nostalgic feelings of eating street food during my childhood period.HAINANESE CURRY RICEThe miniature forest with bird ness and quail egg looked very magical when the staff served it in front of me. The green moss looked very delicate and who could guess that it was made from coriander. The white clay that covered the potato was imported from Spain, the 'black rock' minced chicken was very delicious and everything was put on the bed of quinoa curry. Again, it's very important to mix in all the elements to gain the true flavour. This was simply my favourite dish of the night, in terms of look as well as the strong spicy flavour that it gave. SINGAPORE CHILI CRABThis was the dish that took my breath away when I saw it on Instagram, so I was very excited about it. The chili ice cream was delicious, even when eaten by itself! It was moreover really delicious when mixed together with the soft shell crab. Presentation of each dish really mattered and it showed from the choice of plates that the restaurant used. This dish was presented on a light blue plate that resembled the sea, covered with mantou sand, some caviar, seaweed and foamy crab bisque.SATAY BEEFHubby was really concerned about the size of the beef when he saw the '80g' next to the menu but he was surprised that the beef was quite big. The Wagyu Ribeye was cooked medium rare, served with gnocchi (onion), satay espuma and rice cakes. The rice cakes in this case was peanut mocha which was skilfully wrapped in banana leaves. The beef was perfectly cooked and with the exact amount of layered fat to make it so enjoyable.XO FISHThe fish of the day was red garoupa with a hidden lobster claw served in the Teochew broth. This dish really reminded me of seafood gumbo although not as thick and heavy. The broth was quite light, filled with seafood flavour and mushroom. I found it best when I mixed the broth with the cooked tomato that was provided so it gave the tangy fresh flavour onto the mix.NEW ITEM: MINI APPLE TOFFEEChef Han came out from his kitchen and said hi to us. Not only that, he also brought out a surprising new item that will only be released in early April. It deceivingly looked like a mini apple toffee.PINAPPLE SORBETOur palate cleanser was a refreshing house-made pinapple sorbet and I joked to the staff that one spoon wasn't enough to clean our palate (hahaha). CHENDOL Xiao Long Bao (XLB)I want more of the Chendol XLB, it was a good start to dessert and the staff was so nice that she helped me take a pour shot by pouring the gula melaka slowly on top of the XLB. For a small item, it was quite rich since it has all the elements of chendol such as red bean, shaved ice and jellies.REESE'S CHOCOLATEThe staff playfully asked whether we smoke or drink before he carried out two ashtray filled with a cigar on each. On the other hand, he gave us a glass of Cognac. It was a peanut butter covered with dark chocolate and the Cognac was the refreshing Earl Grey tea.Now the question on people's mind will usually be 'is it worth the money that I paid for'. For me, it was really worth it especially when you consider the creativity, mixture of ingredients, presentation and passion that went into each dish.I had a very enjoyable night at Restaurant Labyrinth and so excited that they will add some new menu items soon. I went to the kitchen to thank Chef Han for his delicious food and to tell him that he needs to do a pop up dining in Perth... or I should just visit Singapore again."

There was only one ""Amuse Bouche"" item (a puff filled with fermented shrimp) which I wasn't a big fan of. The rest was great - especially enjoyed a crab dish which included crab ice spicy cream. There is a Prix Fixe Menu so no choices other than they will upsell you on Wagyu Beef instead of the regular beef and a better shrimp for one of the seafood dishes... I found the upsale thing a bit awkward as they actually come to your table with a slab of Wagyu and some big shrimp and try to convince you to pay the extra amount to improve your dinner... strange approach for a Michelin Starred Fixed Price Menu.The issue I had with the restaurant was mainly the service. We waited a bit before finally asking if we could order a cocktail - our waiter seemed confused about our order (a gin martini and an old fashioned...not very difficult). It was our last night in Singapore and we were looking to get the whole experience starting with drinks...getting some wine with dinner etc. Before our drinks came we were served the Amuse Bouche course...then quickly after that our first course came out....I then asked the waiter if our drinks would be coming out soon...since usually we would have preferred them BEFORE dinner...again the waiter looked confused then asked us again what drinks we had ordered, a little later he returned and said 5 more minutes. By the time we received our drinks the third course was arriving and of course we never got a chance to order wine...Our waiter was friendly but the elaborate explanations of the food was lost on his poor pronunciations. We didn't understand anything he was saying....which was unfortunate as the dishes were remarkably intricate.  After dinner we were not offered coffee or tea...I guess for the money I would never return or recommend to anyone but it's a shame because the food was really interesting."

I was impressed by the simplicity of the dishes and the amazing flavors that were achieved by combining different ingredients together. I never imaged that a sweet oyster sauce could go so well with fillet steak. My mind was blown!Chef Han's attention to detail and knowledge of the ingredients he uses in his dishes is unmatched. The combination of flavors and tastes create a unique experience that is authentically Singaporean, rather than a so-called fusion of other cuisines. I'm am excited to follow Chef Han as he takes on his next challenge of sourcing his ingredients locally and re-creating an authentic Singaporean fine dining experience, like no other Singaporean chef has done in the past."

We got here at 11:30 to beat the crowd. This place fills up by 12:00p. Great for people watching and having conversation as there is adequate space between the tables and the surrounding area isn't too loud. We ordered the brussel sprouts and the Bufalo Margherita pizza to share between two people and it was enough food for us. The brussel sprouts were surprisingly good! A little sweet, sour, and salty all at once. A little twist on the typical bacon-brussel sprout combo you usually get at high end steak restaurants. The brussel sprouts here don't taste as bitter or have as much of brussel sprout taste as what you would get in California. The plate was a bit oily, but expected. I really liked the pizza crust. I'm a huge fan of bread and get pretty picky with crust. The crust was nice and crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. A little thin in the center, but I still really enjoyed the pizza. The tomato sauce wasn't sweet, which I liked. The cheese was nicely melted. I mostly enjoyed eating the crust and I usually avoid crust on pizza. Total bill was almost $45, which isn't too bad for the quality and location. Would definitely come back to try out some of the other pizzas!"

Finally topped with extras to give it that extra umami, that extra umph! Sadly, these pizzas lack character. The crust was tough, almost comparable to leather. The base of the pizza was so thin it could barely hold itself together, the pizza literally fell apart. I know restaurants are suffering through Covid, but I hope Extra Virgin aren't too desperate to have to skimp on flour? All in all, the two pizzas I tried were an utter disappointment.However, this review isn't completely fair because I did get it delivered to my room while serving my SHN.

I couldn't taste any spice (asked for extra chili flakes) just extra saltiness. The pizza arrived looking promising, but the crust was pretty chewy and after a few slices both of us noted how much work is was to chew it down.We also started with a chicken casaer salad. Lettuce, a few croutons, shaved cheese and dressing. The chicken was something pulled out of the refrigerator and dropped on top. Disappointing. Best part about the salad were the croutons.We were lucky it was an usually cool evening for Singapore since there was no indoor seating.

The ingredients taste reasonably fresh, the crust is just right in terms of crispiness and chewiness, and the toppings are fairly interesting but effective combinations. I like the al fresco seating (some may hate this as it's the only option but I'm totally down with the heat over here) and the buckets of Peroni certainly come in handy as does the Kirin on tap.Also, I've been here several times (it's downstairs from my office) and can only describe the service as hit & miss. But the largely Filipino staff serve more hits than misses in my experience, they are normally very nice and, if anything, a tad over-eager. Not sure where all the service-related complaints from my fellow diners are coming from but, by Singapore standards, this really isn't so bad.Best pizzas are the spotted pig, the pistachio and the spicy pepperoni, in my humble opinion.

And if you don't like to dine here, there's always the takeaway option (within the CBD area unfortunately). Dining here can be a sweaty affair as there are no indoor seats, so come at night if you want to avoid the heat. I find it okay as there are lotsa places you can smoke in secret. As the Pizzas are made to order only, waiting times can be a little long when they're packed, so expect some downtime after ordering.

Went on Friday lunchtime, joined the queues (rookie error going at 12.30 on a Friday) and was seated after about 15 minutes (so not too bad). However getting menus was something we had to ask for, and after placing our order, it took over 15 minutes for 2 glasses of house white wine to arrive - and this after asking 4 different staff members (including the manager) if we could be served! I don't understand how hard it is to pour 2 glasses of wine? Especially by this stage the place was not jam packed full either... Staff looked stressed and unprepared (once again, not sure why, it wasn't overly busy at this stage) and once our glasses were empty, there was no offer to get us another? I really don't understand this, such a simple easy upsell opportunity and one that many mid-tier restaurants seem to miss... I noted that 4 other diners also had some sort of follow up or complaint they had to do with staff members so I don't believe I'm a solo case. The pizza itself was good (we had the meat one) and we also had a caprese salad which was decent, with both the mozarella and the tomatoes packing some flavour. Frustratingly, I would eat there again as the finished product is good, but however I know now to order my drink before I'm even seated!"

In our mind, a city can't be ""cosmopolitan"" or ""cool"" if it can't get a pizza right.  But with the addition of Extra Virgin, that's one more stamp of approval for Singapore."

From the conversation I shared with the staff, I opt for the Stamina Donburi Bowl (SG$16.00).  This dish comes with Rice, Beef, Beef Tendon, Spicy Minced Chicken and an Onsen Egg.  Though stated that the Minced Chicken is Spicy, personally it was NOT Spicy for me.  Thankfully they also offer several condiments, at the CONDIMENTS Counter if you wish to add the condiments.I also opt for the Appetizers.  This was the Spicy Karaage aka Spicy Chicken (SG$2.00).  It comes in 3 bite size pieces with a little mayo at its side.  My oh My, those Spicy Karaage is lip smacking good!  I wish I could have ordered more!  Maybe next time.With GST 7%, my Lunch was (SG$19.25).  Complimentary Tea is also provided that comes either Hot or Cold - for this Lunch I opt for COLD.  In conclusion, what I had and the service I received throughout my Lunch was indeed good.  THANK GOD, Fu-Men is located NOT so closed to where I live, ELSE I will be in deep deep trouble.  I will return to Fu-Men in a heartbeat!  The next time I will try the Udon, or some other items which they offer in their Menu.Fu-Men is about 8 to 10 minutes walk from Raffles Place MRT Station (EW14/NS26) at EXIT I.It is opened during the following hours :*  Monday - Friday : 10:00 - 22:00*  Saturday : 10:00 - 14:30*  Sunday : CLOSEDWhile I was about to finish my Lunch, many more Patrons, dine in.  Left Fu-Men at about 12:25hrs ish with a satisfied-filled happy belly tummy indeed!  Oishii!  Arigatou gozaimashita!  I shall see you soon Fu-Men...  Thank you...Fu Men16 Raffles Quay#B1-17/18 Hong Leong Building,Singapore 048581Tel : 6224 1134"

I have heard of Violet Oon's Peranakan Food and always wanted to try thus wish was granted. However instead of going to the one located in Bukit Timah, we went to their latest restaurant located in Clarke Quay.I was not surprise of its interior as it was kind of along the line where a Bar's ambiance will be liked. However it still have a good feel of Peranakan Style (old school) amongst those modern furnishing, decking out in dark woods and authentic Peranakan tiles. Overall the place reminds me of their rich culture but with a revamp into today's settings.If you are hankering for Violet Oon's Peranankan Cuisine like me, fret not. Even though this is a bar and grill, they do incorporate many popular dishes like Ayam Buah Keluah, Kueh Pie Tee, Ngoh Hiang etc.Suitable for vegetarian, these Fried Bean Curds were served with julienned cucumber and fresh beansprouts. Bean Curds were sliced and topped with very yummy Violet's Signature sweet and tangy peanut sauce. A perfect go to start your meal if you are looking for some appetizers.Tau Hu Goreng - $9One of the best Ngoh Hiang i ever had for it was not oily and these Ngoh Hiang tastes refreshing with the crispy deep fried bean curd skin cradling ingredients like prawn, crab and minced chicken with water chestnut seasoning as well as five spice powder. Dipped this fried Ngoh Hiang into the given sweet sauce or Sambal Belachan. It also goes well with the seasoned sides - Achar.Ngoh Hiang - $15When it comes to Nonya Food, this is the classic. Spicy and tangy chicken stew with a few Buah Keluak nuts infused with fresh root spices of Lengkuas and Tumeric. I like that the Chicken meat was tender with generous serving of Buah Keluak however it still lacked the good taste that i find on the meat. Could it be the strong tumeric soury taste had overtaken the authentic taste?Buah Keluak Ayam - $23With a variety of Satay to choose from, each type of meat comes  in a plate of 3. We had the large chicken chunks marinated in spices, grilled and served with thick flavour pack spicy peanut toasted sauce topped with freshly grated pineapple, steam rice cake, cucumber and red onion. Recommended!Chicken Satay - $14You cant miss out this classic dish from the menu! I would say the all time favourite to order. This festive dish of braised mixed vegetables and bean curd skin in a rich prawn bisque is really awesome, love the part where the mushrooms were so juicy and plump. It may seems a bit oily but best of all its not cloying at all.Chap Chye - $15Choose between Nasi Lemak Rice and Jasmine Rice. The Nasi Lemak Rice is served elegantly in a small little white pot, packed with alluring fragrance of the coconut milk.Nasi Lemak Rice - $2Loving the sweet ending to our meal with a scoop of Gula Melaka and coconut ice cream drenched with Gula Melaka syrup. What makes the good experience will be the toasted cashew nuts toppings.VO's Ice Cream with Cashew Crunch - $10Overall, I find that it is a good place for gathering as well as chill out. The ambiance makes alot of difference and you will never feel as if like you are visiting the usual traditional Peranakan Place."

In addition the salad dressing on the salad at Sen tasted as if it had turned.  So while the higher profile dishes on the menu were fresh and prepared well, more standard fare was poor.  Perhaps the way to avoid disappointment is to only order more expensive dishes as that is what the kitchen pays attention to.   Service was excellent.

Free flow of softdrinks, coffee and tea. Price is reasonable. The Just Buffet is a little expensive to me at $19.90. A black pepper chicken priced at $22.90 includes the salad bar is a steal. Get there early or try to call to see if they take reservations. During dinner hours the queue could be long."

I digress.  Marukyu is an upmarket Japanese restaurant. Prices are at the very top end for the area but,  thankfully, so is the raw materials and food preparation as well.  I had the sushi bent box (very reasonable price) and everything,  from the grilled cod,  via the sashimi to the sushi rice tasted great and was perfectly cooked. (The sashimi wasn't cooked - you get my point. I look forward to come back and try the fuller menu in the near future.  I hope I'll be able to keep the 5 star rating - I love japanese food."

Heart of Darkness (HoD)has not been around a long time, but the depth of flavor and the balance in all their beers belies a wealth of experience extending far beyond the founding of the craft brewery in Saigon, Vietnam.  I've been recommending people visit HoD when in Saigon for as long as I can remember and now there's one right in my own backyard!  Life just very very much better for anybody who enjoys a flavorful pint.  I'm not knocking national or commercial lagers, but if you're counting calories like me, then you might consider giving beers that are brewed independently and with quality ingredients to underscore the highlights of each beer style's characteristic traits a go to make those calories count!If you know Tras Street, then you'll know that it's converted shophouses that now house bars, restaurants, karaoke bars, coffee joints, and speakeasies. While HoD Singapore is not a speakeasy, you need to pay attention of you might just miss out on a good time.  The set up is a taproom and an open kitchen. Thirty taps serve 25 HoD beers and 5 guest taps that will likely be representing local craft breweries, so right off the bat, HoD Singapore is a good ""high density"" beer location to be visiting,  especially if you're not in Singapore for long.  The partner at HoD Singapore, also has an active interest in craft brewing in Singapore and the likes of That Singapore Beer Project and Daryl's Urban Ales are likely to be regular taps at HoD!  The space is cozy, and has a pleasantly edgy vibe.  I like it here already, and am thankful to be alive in Singapore at this very moment when craft beer is exploding in the hands of professionals who care about the product enough to want you to care too and enjoy a quality product the way it was created to rock your world!"

After going around trying different Jerky's offered in SIngapore...this by far has to be the best. And during my layover in Shanghai... I actually saw  they had a stand there!!! PLEASEEEEEEE OPEN ONE IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA!!!! I totally need one of these near me so I can snack happily hahahaha.The texture wasn't super soft and not super hard. Very fresh and they make their jerky's daily. OHHHH how I wish meat was accepted to bring through customs to the US!!!! Since I was just around the corner... I had bought some and snacked on it during my stay. This location is pretty open spaced but super clean. I like how you can even sample the jerky's too before you decide if you want to buy it or not given they have sooo many different flavors as well. I never saw a line here even during the weekends. People are totally missing out if they aren't buying their jerky's here. Highly recommended to tourists too if you ever decide to head to Singapore.

I've had the takeaway here a few times. Take note they charge 1 dollar more for the brown rice option. I finally went in to have a sit down one day as I was craving uni. I ordered set a at $9 and sec c at $20. After I finished my small salad (bleah) and was halfway through my miso soup (mediocre) the waiter came back to me to say that uni was out. Imagine my disappointment. They told me they would sub scallop. The waiter was kinda just told by the chef to tell me. Chef made no eye contact. Manager was busy chatting away her own stuff at the counter quite loudly.If you compare my photo of the 2 sets. It really looks like I paid 11 dollars more for a hotate sushi which is overpriced. In the end the sushi quality was not bad and the size of the slice was good. But I think the service is the opposite of warm.  Considering the place was nearly empty as I was having a late lunch (2pm) they could have example offered me a free dessert or something for the disappointment. Instead the asked if I wanted to upgrade my salad to panna cota for 3 dollars which I declined. Still OK for takeaway but I would only come in if I have a strong craving for sushi specifically and I check that they have what I want upfront.  For takeaway 4 star, for dine in which was this latest visit was 3 star."

Sweet, spicy, tangy......how can this humble looking sandwich taste so fabulous? I could not suppress my excitement and wanted to find out what magic has gone into this sandwich. ""It's Chilli flakes that we've infused into the olive oil and that tang comes from the clots of lemon milk juice cream you see on top of the mushrooms."" answered the owner Traveen in a slow-paced Norwegian accent. Chilli flakes and lemon milk juice? WOW. This brilliant inspiration can only be found here at Smor, Singapore's first Scandinavian Deli that is opened by food enthusiast twin brothers Traveen and Tarun Gulrajani. They were so captivated by the concept of Smorrebrod (which means ""butter bread"") during their 3-month tour of 12 Scandinavian cities that they decided to bring it to Singapore, elevating to an artisan level with quality ingredients all sources from Scandinavia.  It is not only the quality ingredients that make this worth. Like the Kale and Mushroom, the Crunchy Bacon is piled onto buttery and crisp toasted brioche bread that doesn't turn claggy with the moisture of tomatoes. Topped with side eggs, wilted baby spinach and shavings of emmental cheese, this warm open-faced sandwich is a great breakfast choice that tickles one's fancy.  These sandwiches worked amazingly better than most cold pleasure-less wraps as they are prepared fresh upon order. The warm versions easily gain the upper hands as our palates acclimatize to the heat but the cold sandwiches are seriously not bad either.  Instead of mundane ingredients like cream cheese and capers, the Smoked Salmon has a lovely acidic-sweet kick coming from the horseradish and dill-infused sweet mustard dressing which I mistaken to be honey at first. Some might find the Norwegian hand-peeled shrimps to be tad salty but if you factor in the tangy lemon mayonnaise and the sprinkles of chives, it's a simple, refreshing yet addictive combo.  These voluminous seafood filling are stacked onto gluten-free light rye bread is resilient enough to avoid saturation from the extra moisture, yet still soft enough that it doesn't wear out the muscles as you chow into it.  This is probably also the only place in Singapore where you can discover a fair range of Scandinavian chocolate snacks, savoury produce like caviar or coffee. I bought the Jaffa Nougatine bar ($2.50), some really good milk wafers at only $2.50 and the Shuffle Toffee Biscuits, the sinful combination of snickers, Mars and Toackers that are worth the calories.  I have posted the Shuffle Toffee on my instagram hereWas it by chance that we managed to pick all four choices that were delicious? I seriously doubt so. Yes, the price of $6.90 for one sandwich, $12.90 for two and $17.90 for the Viking meal of three might seemed a little pricey or not satisfyingly sufficient for a meal. But trust me, a regular meal of two sandwiches are more than enough to fill you up. Moreover, if it's such a wholesome meal prepared with healthy ingredients, passion and sincerity, why not?  I seldom say that I will return to try the place but this I shall unabashedly say that a return is a must."

Excellent texture and flavouring - it was very tasty. They replicated the meat flavour well and I appreciated the beautiful lettuce it came with. It was topped with mushrooms and cheese. I docked 0.25 stars because it was too salty, and the last star for the bread, which tasted like a nicely toasted but regular hamburger bun, i.e. too soft and unsubstantial. I'm a huge bread person and the only burgers I've ever approved of have been gourmet ones with Real bread for buns. Solid, though I hardly crave burgers so I'm not sure I'd be back unless they could make it less salty and get a real loaf of bread."

They suggested to go with Medium rare which makes the patty a melt-in-your-mouth-experience. The combination of the beef juices, cheddar cheese and caramelised onions all soaking the bun, makes it one of my favourite burgers in Singapore. Your hands will get messy, so make sure to have napkins on hand. Tried the Buttermilk Fried Chicken on another occasion. The salted egg mayo and homemade slaw makes all the difference and what puts it above other chicken type burgers I've had from other joints.

Lots of other food options in the same food court--drinks, ice cream, coffee, other main meals. The burgers were good though nothing special, but the truffle Parmesan fries were delicious and so were the sweet potato fries. We also got a chocolate shake but weren't digging the crumbled malt balls on top."

However they do give decently large portion sizes so that makes up for it. I shared the bruschetta board with all three kinds on there. They really loaded on the lox and other toppings. I ordered their watermelon orange juice and while it was nice I probably wouldn't order it again. The Amoy food center is just around the corner and has the same drink for a fraction of the cost. They do have self serve water which was nice and cool. It really helped to combat the hot weather. My friend ordered the idea bulb which was super cute and really went well with the decor. It was expensive but you can keep the bulb as a souvenir. They do have an extensive menu that ranges from bruschetta to protein shakes and a full bar so make sure you take a thorough look at everything. The inside looks as if a hoarder decorated it but in a very chic retro way. I loved the clusters of interns and lights hanging from the ceiling. We ended up sharing a long table with another group but it was completely comfortable. The tables were a little too close to each other but they do have storage space underneath each table so that bags don't block the way. It was really busy here during the lunch rush but after 12:45 it started clearing up.

Actually, my first thought when I heard about this place was ""what a corny name for a cafe"". The Chinese name is a literal translation, which doesn't really help... But maybe they are trying to be ironic in a hipster way that I'll never understand? But corny name aside, the food was good, so I shan't harp on it.We had the My Awesome Salad and the Parma Ham Sandwich (with brie added on). I loved the sandwich, the bread was soft and warm, yet crispy on the sides. They were generous with their ingredients and it was very tasty. Same for the salad, it came with a large serving of smoked salmon, roasted chicken and tuna mayonnaise. My only gripe was that the avocado was a bit raw. We were here after spin class down the road so it was a good thing that their food portions were huge- we were starving! It was a good deal and really unexpected as each dish is only about $15-20 on average.Decor is... Interesting. Red paper lanterns galore, high stools made of pipes, desks turned into dining tables. The air conditioning (either that or the very powerful fans) was adequate, but just barely. SUMMARY: quirky decor, very good bread, portions are huge for the price ($15-20). Would visit again!"

The salads are great for lunch or a light dinner, though on the pricey side ($15++, addt'l $3 for cheese on the My Awesome Salad making it $18++). Still tasty enough for me to order the salad on every visit, I just can't make this a regular weekly stop for lunch.The happy hour specials are good for the CBD in my opinion (somewhere ~$35 for a bottle of wine, if memory serves, and something for beer and bubbly too). I wish you didn't have to queue up by the kitchen in order to pay at the end, as I feel massively in the way of the staff running back and forth with dishes of food which I could knock into.

I really love this place and would definitely recommend it if you're ever taking a break from shopping in The Shoppes at Marina Bay! There were a whole bunch of food vendors in the food court that appealed to me, but Pepper Lunch had something I was craving for: STEAK!!As of July 2019, I got the combo #9 which consisted of diced steak, mashed potatoes, 2 pieces of green string beans, corn, bean sprouts, and a side of white rice and miso soup. I wanted eggs too, so I did an add-on of it. This dish was PERFECT, every ingredients that I love in one set of meal. I was able to finish my entire meal with a happy, filled stomach too! All of this cost me about 14.90 SGD, equivalent to about $11 USD. This was especially cheap compared to all the other food vendors that my family bought theirs at. And my family ended up not liking their food and were still hungry. I don't know much about meat, but I felt like my steak was either angus or... yeah, angus steak I think lol. At first, it's given to you as rare to medium rare on a sizzling hot plate (so be careful NOT to touch the plate!) Also, it was quite heavy to carry the entire meal to my table which was waaaaay across the other side of the food court T_T I survived by walking slowly and making sure other people wouldn't have bumped into me, otherwise it would've been a HOT mess. Literally. Anyways, I love, love, LOVED how my steak somehow cooked its way to my liking and also it was seasoned very well. Adding the egg was worth it and definitely completed the dish.OH YEAH. They prepared my dish in under 2 minutes after placing my order!"

Their chicken with chillis is very tasty, chicken fried just nice and the taste of the spices, garlic and chillis balance well to produce the flavorful and numbing chicken. They are very generous with their garlic, hence for garlic fans like me, this is a big plus.Their bullfrog on the other hand was not as fantastic as their chicken with chillis. We ordered the spicy and numbing bullfrog where the frog legs were literally drowned in the chilli oil, and the gravy within could not get into the frog legs, hence most of the time I just tasted oily spicy frog legs. No doubt the frog legs were fresh, but the gravy did not enhance the taste farther and it was rather disjointed. I would say it's an average dish.The previous time I was here, I ordered their spicy catfish dish which came in a huge portion. It could feed about 3-4 pax and the gravy was flavorful. What you should do is order dumplings or rice to go with this and you can enjoy the gravy at the same time.Overall, I would highly recommend this place, as I would usually take the trouble to write reviews for places that are worth writing for (against if it's really bad)."

I only mention this bit of information because Man Man is tucked in the back of a shophouse which faces Keong Saik Road, while Man Man itself faces a pedestrian access path / park that people typically use as a shortcut. Despite it's hidden location, apparently queues here for their dinner service can reach up to an hour or more. Having just had lunch there (I hate lining up), I can see why people go through the trouble of waiting.At the top of the steps and just inside the glass doors leading into Man Man are 3 large, thigh-high tanks with water flowing into them. These tanks are home to live Anguilla japonica - Japanese eels, or (once grilled) ""unagi"". It is quite fitting that one's first encounter upon stepping foot into Man Man is the main course because it truly is the star of the show here. The restaurant has tables spread out in the oddly shaped space, along with a bar counter that faces both the chopping board, where the eels presumably shuffle off their mortal coil, and the binchotan grill where they get transformed into unagi.The menu features several types of hitsumabushi (a specialty of Nagoya city), unadon and smaller side dishes (such as unagi cooked in tamago). I settled on a large unadon, which was served within 5-10 minutes and was the perfect size for lunch. Without going into too much detail, not all unagi is created equal, and sometimes you end up with something that has the consistency and texture of chewing on a rubber hose. This is NOT the case at Man Man, where they serve the real deal, and which is the perfect combination of flaky meat combined with the slight crunchy/chewiness of the charred skin.Barring a plane trip to Japan, this is one of the most authentic unagi meals you will ever have anywhere (with my benchmark being Marushizu in Tokyo). Coming to a total of S$45.65 (after service and tax), it is also a lot cheaper than that plane ticket. For that price, you will not leave hungry as the unagi is served on a generous portion of rice, with a small tofu appetizer, gari (pickled ginger) and a bowl of suimono (clear soup), along with a cup of cold barley tea. The only thing I recommend is asking for the sansho pepper as a touch of the ground pepper really rounds out the flavor of the unagi.Oh, and they have takeaway too if you really hate lining up!"

I'd recommend the large size if you crave unagi.

The 6 counter seats were the first to fill up.  The place was quite smoky. One could even smell the smoky grilling smell before entering the place. The place was decorated in a light wooden look. By the way I did see a customer who bought a couple of fresh eels back too. Tables were placed quite near to each other. There was barely place for bags but lucky I selected a table by the shelf, therefore got place in the shelf for bag.On the table, there was condiments such as sweet sauce, unagi sauce, spicy, Japanese pepper and chilli powder to help yourself to. Refillable Iced tea was served.Kimoyaki (Liver) ($9.80+)Looked quite charred, It was chewy with smoky although it was a tab bitter at certain parts.Yahatamaki ($14.80+)Unagi roll stuffed with pickled radish in it. Crunchy and tangy.Large Kouhaku Histsumabushi ($39.90+)Unagi Served with Mentaiko Sauce, Soup, Pickles, Broth, Spices.The dish was a January special.To eat Histsumabushi, divide the serving into 4 parts.1) Have one serving in the small bowl which is also known as torizara, to enjoy the dish in its original tasteyakumi2) Second serving, add the yakumi (condiments such as fresh wasabi, chopped spring onions and green onions). I spend quite a lot of time busy grating the wasabi. The fresh wasabi really peaked up the dish.3) Third serving, add the lightly-flavored dashi (made from simmering fish or meat) broth. The dish reminded one of teochew porridge.4) Eat the Last Serving the way You Like best. As for me, I like it with the broth and freshly grated wasabi in it.The layer of Mentaiko Sauce was a tab too little to make a different to the dish.Although there was long queue, most customers finished their meals quite fast."

I got this in the regular size, and this was plenty of food for me.- Unagi Bone Crackers: We got this as an appetizer, and it was surprisingly good!

One of them? Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant. I've heard the reviews, I've seen the  queues and I have to admit, my first reaction was, ""crazy, I won't queue for that"".How wrong I was. If not for my colleague suggesting Man man for a group dinner, I might have never gone to try it, despite my love for Unagi. #1 Tip. If you're going to be arriving anytime after 5.30pm, be prepared to wait. We got there at 5.20pm (our office is pretty nearby) and still ended up being the 6-7th group in the queue. The restaurant is small and cozy and really reminds you of Japan. What makes this restaurant different from other restaurants serving Unagi? The Unagi is freshly killed, skewered and grilled  in the restaurant. Medium Donburi ($25.80+)We decided to go with the basic, although the sight of everyone having the Hitsumabushi made us regret that decision a bit (oh well, gives me a reason to come back). After one bite, all I could say was......... life changing. What ever idea I had of what a good unagi should be and taste like went completely out the window. The sauce was flavourful without overpowering the natural sweetness of the eel and the eel.... oh my. It was tender, juicy, it melts in your mouth and tasted so.... pure (I can't even find the right words to describe it). Bottom line, I can see why it received its Bib Gourmand. Only draw back would be the queue but despite that, it still easily gets 5 stars from me."

The entrance is humbly tucked in a back alley that you might not notice if you weren't looking for it. As you walk in, you're greeted by nothing less than two pools of live unagi. I like a restaurant that knows what they stand for and isn't shy about it. Around 8:30pm on a Thursday, there wasn't too much of a line and we were seated almost immediately. Most of the tables are cozy, which is typical of a Japanese restaurant, so smaller groups are more ideal. Most come here to try unagi three ways, and that's exactly what I got, the Butamabushi for S$18.80+. The unagi was so fresh and perfectly basted. Basically the three ways are unagi with rice, unagi mixed with the side ingredients (seaweed, scallion, and wasabi), and lastly unagi with the ingredients and with a soup/dashi broth. You actually divide the serving into four parts, and the last part is eaten in your favorite way. My favorite was with seaweed and a hint of wasabi. The refillable ice green tea was also very welcome, and I'm glad they didn't pinch on small things like drinks. We also got a small side dish of unagi bone crackers for S$6, which probably wasn't necessary, but it was different and fun. Bravo for going all out on unagi by sourcing and preparing it like nobody else in Singapore."

My friend and I waited an hour which would have been longer if we were a bigger group. The place is pretty small which explains the long queue. We got a seat near the counter where they prepared the food. We were lucky to face the side of grilling the unagi instead of the side of slicing the unagi which was quite a bloody and unpleasant sight. You can also choose not to look up and just dig into your food. The unagi had really crispy skin and tender meat.

Tandoori prawns at Gajalee are so good, just blasting with flavor. I ate them quickly then resumed the waiting period for the next dish. This wait period was a bit longer than the last, during which the waiter put a plastic bib on me. Then he brought out the green chili crab. This was the best crab I've ever eaten, and the whole reason for the 4 star rating. The rice and naan came out shortly after the crab. Each dish was spooned out by the server onto my plate.I would've preferred all the food to come out at once - and just put it on the table, I can handle it from there.  Overall great tasting food. I would go back for the green chili crab."

Being a huge, and I mean HUGE, fan of anything salted egg, the gf was naturally attracted to their Liu Sha custard donut. Now, we've been let down by a lot of Liu Sha or salted egg custard products before. More often than not, they tasted a little flat or were too sweet, so our expectations weren't very high.$5++ and 3 donuts later, our minds were blown. We've read reports that it was average, or the Liu Sha wasn't ""flowy"" enough but we thought it was perfect. It didn't need to be a wet liquid-y filling or it would have created quite a mess. The dough was nicely moist and fluffy a and the filling wasn't overly sweet. Only draw back would be the amount of sugar they sprinkled it with. Made the donut a tad bit too sweet. I would have sprinkled less or used powdered sugar instead.

I recommend that you speak to manager Anthony to ask for off-menu items to get a taste of the freshest fish that the restaurant offers in any given week. Because of Anthony I have discovered new sashimi to love, like the Golden Snapper (kin medai) and opened my eyes to things like Cod Fish Sperm (shirako), which I won't bring myself to try again but my palate is all the more sophisticated for having tasted it, I'm sure.Also off-menu is the Inaniwa Udon. These udon noodles are thinner than the usual udon (think linguine vs. spaghetti) and very much more delicious imho. It's handmade in the restaurant, and not always available. Some other restaurants serve inaniwa udon too, but the one at Sushi Kou is the best I've had so far."

They have a fair selection of set meals too, which are value for money. Most would be less than $30 with a portion of meat and sashimi or sushi. Comes with rice, soup and a chawanmushi. Ambience is nice and relaxed. Both times that I went, there was no feeling that you were being rushed out of your meal even though the place can get quite packed."

This little restaurant is one of our favourites now. It is the same owner group as Rakuzen in Millenia Walk and they have the sashimi flown in from Japan twice weekly. Once you taste all the Sashimi or Sushi, you can immediately tell the freshness of the ingredient.The menu is short but they keep it simple with good quality. The service is great and the price is reasonable. There are recently many expensive sushi restaurants in Singapore with a very posh atmosphere and fancy settings. However the price is really jaw dropping at these places!! Sushi kou is down to earth, reasonable and friendly without cutting on quality. A good find when you just want good sushi and good service without all the fuss. Definitely the perfect place to take your important Japanese guests. Just a note: The Japanese chef is pretty good looking and friendly too! :p"

Always ask the wait staff for recommendation and you will not be disappointed. Just like their neighbour, Teppei, they offer relatively cheap omakase but personally I haven't to try them as I'm happy with their sashimi selections."

I absolutely love the location of the restaurant and the decor (the ceiling!) was beautiful!

Lunch at Odette was certainly very good but maybe my expectations were too high.My friend and I had the 6 course lunch, we were lucky enough to be able to book around 3 weeks in advance. The reservation process was pleasant, they ask for a deposit and a confirmation. I was a bit confused why they asked for another confirmation: once seemed enough for me, especially considering the cancellation policy of taking your deposit if you are a no-show. Nevertheless, service wise, I have nothing to complain: all staff was extremely attentive and friendly, despite the fact that the restaurant was filled with fellow chefs and food critics (we were there during the world's best 50 event).Foodwise it was also excellent. I felt like all dishes had a clear focus, was extremely balanced and highlighted the ingredients. My faves were definitely the Rosemary Smoked Egg and the Red Mullet. Especially the Smoked Egg with the potato tasted like my favorite comfort food (mash with a soft boiled egg) elevated to Michelin status.So overall great food and excellent service... so why no five stars? I don't think it compares with the former greatness of Andre... I think Odette does classics to perfection but lacks innovation. If I read some of the older reviews, I've noticed that the dishes stayed more or less the same over the years. A restaurant in this league should lead innovation but hey, if mr Michelin and mr World's Best 50 disagree with me, I might be wrong or maybe it is personal preference?I'll definitely want to go and try the dinner offer and see if they can convince me to add that 5th yelp star!"

Though I wouldn't usually go for a French menu in an Asian country, I had read good things about Odette, so we decided to come here. Reservations are accepted 60 days in advance online, so if you want a Friday or Saturday dinner, you should plan ahead.  We did dinner on a Friday night. The menu comes as ""8 acts"" for 358 SGD (about $260 USD), which isn't that outrageous if you look at the price for 3 Michelin star places in SF and NY these days.  They also have a shorter lunch option available.Canapés - Tartlet with white chocolate and PX vinegar - Gougeres (a unique long shape) with tomato  - Sweet shrimp with cumin, herbs, and avocado on a crisp Amuse:Mushroom tea Cep sabayon winter buckwheat and walnuts, mushroom tea, cep mushroom brioche with truffle butter Bread service: with salted whipped butter with buckwheat and extra virgin olive oil from Catalonia - Baguette - Sourdough- Truffle brioche There are 2 menu options: vegetarian and non vegetarian. Due to some dietary restrictions, they were nice enough to let me mix and match a bit. 1a. Promenade a Singapore: herbs and vegetables from local farms, with Japanese kombu and tomatoes 1b. Caviar and uni toast (regular menu)2a. Charred avocado: with pear and celery, vadouvan, apple sorbet 2b. Japanese mackerel with horseradish snow and tapioca cracker 3. Heirloom beetroot variation: with stracciatella, pomegranate seeds, and honey. The beets included smoked beetroot, beet sorbet, beet meringue. This was a very unique beet dish with lots of flavors and textures.4. Rosemary smoked organic egg: soft cooked egg with smoked potato and Iberico chorizo, brown butter foam. This is their signature dish and was probably my favorite for the night.5a. Variations of cabbage with romanesco and black truffle 5b. Foie gras and abalone with bbq pork puff, pickled shiitake 6. BBQ Kinki: Japanese fish with rutabaga puree, prawn, mousse, grilled squid, saffron sauce, dill oil 7a. Red kuri squash agnolotti: with parmigiano reggiano and black grilled mushrooms. I think my pasta dish was the winner of the two options7b. Charred, smoked pigeon from Brittany with a confit and bbq leg, deep fried heart, liver in a tart. The pigeon was very unique ad presented beautifully but was too gamey and strong for me.8. Cheese cart: beautiful cart, good selection, 38 SGD supplement9. Pre dessert: Grapefruit sorbet with mint foam, blood orange, green tea 10. Yuzu tart: with shiso and basil, yuzu sorbet, yuzu foam. I love yuzu, so this was perfect for me. It was a nice, light dessert.Petit fours:- Lychee and rose lollipop - Caneles (my favorite)- Musk melon - Mini chocolate tart They send you home with a cute jar of house jam, which is a nice touch.Service was on point (fresh napkins each time you get up, coordinated setting of dishes, etc), though I would expect no less for 3 stars. Overall, everything was solid, and it was a great special occasion meal, but nothing was super innovative or particularly standout for us."

I want to say top 3 (with Tickets and Akelarre as some other meals in that tier for me). I felt like the value of ambiance, service, and food was fairly matched by the cost of the meal. We went on a weekend so they only offered 6 course or 8 course for lunch and originally we wanted to do the 5 course they offer for lunch on weekdays, but it's hard to get a reservation here so we took whatever they could offer. If you want to try this restaurant on a budget, go for lunch on a weekday and they will serve a S$128 4 course menu. Caution though, when you're budgeting for this meal, it's both on a financial and time dimension. This certainly isn't your one hour lunch and not even your 2 hour lunch, it took us 3 and a half hours! When they say 8 courses, what they mean is like 8 real dishes and they don't include the transitioning dishes that help cleanse your palate (which many restaurants would include as part of the tasting menu). Overall I think I counted around 15 dishes. Dish after dish combined the freshest and highest quality ingredients with beautiful execution. The ingredients were from a vast array of cuisines, including uni, pigeon, foie gras, caviar, truffle, scallop, shiitake, and so much more. One note that I have to make is if you set yourself a budget for this meal, when they ask if you would like some cheese (either a homemade truffle cheese or a cheese tasting) it's going to be extra and they don't warn you about it. It costs S$35 extra for the cheese. Was it worth it? We got to taste a lot of different kinds of cheese, both in taste and texture. However, there were maybe only one cheese we really liked (Ossau iraty) so probably not worth the cost.All dishes were amazing, my favorites would be the Hokkaido uni and toast, abalone with foie gras, rosemary smoked egg, and some of the amuse bouche. I don't want to ruin any surprises, but just sit back and enjoy the composition."

First up were canapés. 4 bite-sized delights. All quite tasty (sorry can't remember the details). Followed by amuse bouche of mushroom ""tea"". This was good, full of umami though that a half piece of brioche as a chaser was unnecessary in my view. Then the bread platter arrived. A piece of tree bark was used in place of a plate. Presentation was great! 3 different types of bread were served - chia seed focaccia was our favorite, but the sourdough wedge was lovely too. The thyme brioche was the weakest link. The flavor wasn't intense enough to make any impact. Two different butters were served - salted lardo (yes, it's piggy fat) and unsalted butter. Then the meal was served proper. I shan't go into details of each plate but they were all well presented and tasty. But I wouldn't say it's overwhelming impressive, especially if they are aiming for the Michelin star. Service was choppy, my glass of water was empty for a good while before it was noticed and topped up. Most of the servers are foreigners and cannot enunciate their words properly.

There is no pretentiousness like I'm noticing after the Stars have been awarded like in other restaurants where there once was no such thing (e.q. Corner House).I agree with Nik T that Odette was always in the shadows of the more adventurous and experimental Andre but now that the latter has closed its doors, Odette truly shines above all other Singapore Michelin Stars. The dishes are beautiful and full of flavor as well as many courses with the bells and whistles of dry ice and smoke.The ambiance is comfortable but the staff quickly makes you feel at home, very conversational and full of knowledge and warmth. Although this is a typical long tasting menu dinner, if there was any in Singapore to spend on that is uniquely Singapore, definitely do Odette."

The limited number of tables available and the fairly egalitarian reservation policy is a big factor, though some would say Julien is the biggest pull and who doesn't want to see the insides of the Supreme Court anyway? The wait time for a table on the weekend now stands at about 1.5 months, though cancellations do happen so I recommend calling up the hostess to leave your number. Fine dining restaurants usually have a ""money table"" and another for last minute special people but this doesn't exist at Odette, which I found out after several people came back to me empty handed.So was it worth the wait? I think the restaurant has a lot of potential and I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, but I didn't walk away with my mind blown. So the answer is... ""I guess so"". There are clear signs of greatness in the attention to detail in plating picturesque dishes, the variety of flavors and textures and some theatrical sauce-pouring and smoke. The price point is incredible value as well at $128 for 6 creative courses. Plus I love the design of the restaurant - it makes one feel calm, uncluttered and chic. I liked my amuse bouche, pork belly and bread (don't laugh...the restaurants that ace bread-making tend to make great food too) but I was also bored by the play it safe ingredient list: Truffles in every other fish? Check. Pork belly? Check. Foie gras? Check. Given how well the dishes were executed, why not be adventurous with the produce? I've heard the French are as nose-to-tail happy as Chinese to some degree after all. There lies the problem I suppose - I didn't think any dish was bad but I didn't find anything so unique or memorable that I could recall its name or contents a week later. Yes I was with a work-related acquaintance and so my mind wasn't 100% focused on the food, but I tried Per Se in a similar context and could still remember the piece of SRF slow cooked beef I had that melted in my mouth, the famous pearls and the insane ending line-up of desserts. I will end by saying that I'm still tempted to return to try the dinner degustation because the chefs could have been limited by the affordable price point required at lunchtime. In a way, I think the food at Odette is like a straight A student at the PSLE exams - schooled in good techniques and scoring points, but needs to use that to express some real creativity and risk to achieve greatness.  Let's see what happens."

Also, I always see a group of Japanese people here, so I'm pretty sure this joint is legit!I remember coming here the first time for a UYE that Cindy Q.* set up many moons ago. This place has come a long way since then. They've expanded their food offerings, and I'm willing to overlook their Japanese English descriptions and the occasional misspellings on the menu as the food is pretty solid. The last time I went, I started with the tuna ""tar tar"" (sic) which was a creamy mixture with some avocado. I know it sounds as interesting as a double decker couch (Lego movie, anyone?) but shiok it was! For mains, Miguel and I are fans of the salmon rice that they serve in a heated clay pot. Before they serve it to you, they throw in a tablespoon of butter in the center of the bowl, then mix it up with some raw salmon. I think it's fairly priced for $19.We were still able to walk in without a reservation on a Friday evening, but it was almost full by around 8 PM. I'd definitely reserve if you're a group of 4 or more. Order all of the fried goodness and enjoy it over a cold Asahi. A great place to grab some grub before the club!*CORRECTION: My initial post mentioned Marcus L. as the organizer of this UYE, when in fact it was Cindy Q. Gotta give credit where credit is due.

Then we had the butter Mochi, beef carpaccio, salmon yukke, tuna tartare, fish cake stuffed with cheese and a mentaiko dip and the 'kfc' fried chick. All fab. Very unhealthy. But you know what you're in for.  The clear winner was the salmon yukke. A soft boiled egg with an awesome runny yolk sat on top of sliced fresh salmon. Drizzled with some ponzu sauce and lady finger bits and seaweed, we dipped almost everything in the leftover sauce. Licked it up. I wanted to lick up the mentaiko dip too but stopped myself. Now I'm not sure why. It was absolutely yummy. Salty and tasty with little bits that you bite into. Then there was the beef. Not as raw as I would like but totally tasty and tender too. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the Mochi in butter broth. Just too much chewing needed. It had the texture of an agadashi tofu until you start chewing and then it becomes gummy. Eeks!

Basically if you order edamame, you have to play scissors paper stone with the server. If you win you can grab a handful of edamame from the basket with all 5 fingers. If you lose, you can only use 3. But I saw an expatriate lady who lost..and the staff very nicely gave her a second chance. She still lost but she grabbed a lot of edamame with 3 fingers anyway..so it seems like a good and fun deal to me!Today they had a negitoro special, also for $12.

A good variety of about 8 types of rice bowls from the regular chicken don to more interesting ones with raw salmon and tuna, not forgetting the eel! You know that these folks are serious about offering you a good value lunch as it's not just the run of the mill type rice bowls that offered.

Searched on Yelp, and discovered this place. Here's my review (taste is in point 3)1. The atmosphere is nice and really casual. As some of the reviews have mentioned, if you do a reservation they will write a simple greeting card for you. And the wet towels they provide are also hand decorated. The effort to personalize your meal is notable, and I applaud it. This act certainly stands out from most restaurants.2. This restaurant has a lot of emphasis on your personal interaction with your food. I got an unagi ""rice bowl"" and the Girl got a salmon ""rice bowl"", and we were supposed to mix the rice with the butter and soft boiled egg a la Pepper Lunch. And another customer came and they ordered Green Peas, and there was a ""challenge"" by the staff in which the customer was given 1 chance to grab as much green peas with 1 hand as his dish. Such interaction certainly makes your visit more memorable, and probably makes the food taste better.3. Now for the food proper. I got the Unagi Meshi ($19.80), and mixed the rice myself. Considering the price, the piece of unagi in my stone bowl is ok-ish in size - it's about palm size. Nonetheless, it was marinated well and had a good texture! (I'm a fan of teriyaki unagi) the rice was nice, soft and not too sticky (there was butter in the rice so that could have helped). The only point is the rice crust that forms from the rice being stuck on the hot stone bowl, but that can't really be helped. I also ordered the Masuzake ($9.80), which gave me 180ml of Sake. It is served in an wooden box and a ""shot glass"" (you probably would see it in other reviews), and definitely eye catching. However though, it's not as strong ""alcoholic-ally"" sake as I expected it to be. So it'll be good for those who haven't tried sake before. But for sake lovers this sake might, in my limited opinion, not provide enough punch (that burning sensation down the throat). Nonetheless, the sake was pleasant and very nice to drink down!Overall, I would bring my friends along to try this place due to the interesting interactions that they can get. Price wise... Considering it's right at Boat Quay, it's not too bad. Good place as a date too! But the reason for 4 stars is, the food is not that impressive that would leave a lasting impression in me."

I enjoy the variety of food dishes available here, they have small bites and moderate portion dishes right up to rice and noodle dishes, so you can go regardless of how hungry you are. I love their fried chicken, the batter is sweet and crunchy and the meat is tender inside. Plus, I like it that you can order per pc so you don't feel like such a pig. I like the sashimi salad as well, for $8.70, I think the portion and quality of fish is pretty good. The other item on the menu I really love is the salmon butter rice. They cook the salmon, butter and rice together with mentaiko (cod roe) right in front of you in a sizzling hot bowl, and I loveeeee the flavor of the rice. All topped off with a pint of ice cold Sapporo, and I am  a happy girl. :D"

First off, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I used the wrong credit card and rather than just saying sorry, the staff took the time to reverse my charge and make sure everything was right. Second, I ordered a burger and was planning to get my latte later but they allowed me to order all at the same time so I could jump to the head of the line when I went to order my latte. The burger and fries were phenomenal then the latte and chocolate & almond croissant I got afterwards were spectacular. I can't recommend this place highly enough.

This is the kind of Chinese restaurant where the food is not slammed down or rushed.  We ate here twice - once for dim sum and then several days later for dinner.  Dim Sum was a very delicious.  We had the usual steamed char siu bao, xioo long bao, look fun, spare ribs, etc.  All of it was hot and fresh.  Hard to mention more than that as dim sum in Singapore is pretty much always delicious.   However, we had a couple of different items that I've never seen before.  First were these pumpkin looking dim sum.  They were a mild pumpkin flavored flour wrap with a custard inside.  They were really neat and different.  The other interesting item was the Spring Rolls that were twice as long.  The difference in presentation really made you want to try it.  yelp.com/biz_photos/drag…The best meal we had here though was dinner.  We were treated to a magnificent dinner in one of the private rooms.  Each dish that came out was amazing!  The highlight of the dinner was the whole Suckling Roast Pig.  The skin was so thin and crispy and was served with these pancakes.  It was to die for!   yelp.com/biz_photos/drag…Another notable dish was the Shark's Fin Soup.  To be honest, we never thought we would ever eat this dish again now that it is illegal in Hawaii.  I did feel a bit guilty though.  yelp.com/biz_photos/drag…The last dish that I loved and would go back to eat was the Taro Ring with vegetables.  I've had the taro ""basket"" before which is like eating hard chips.  This dish was mashed taro that was deep fried where the outside was deliciously crispy (not hard) with a melt in your mouth mashed taro inside.  yelp.com/biz_photos/drag…Service here was amazing.  We had Maggie serve us both times and she is a delightful lady and totally on it.  We always had clean plates, filled water and tea.  She even portioned out most of the dishes.  I loved how she urged us to eat the Taro Ring while it was hot.  We enjoyed chatting with her about her world travels.  Hopefully, the next time we're in Singapore we can go back to Dragon Phoenix for more delicious food and to see Maggie!"

The Singapore edition of Burger Joint attempts to recreate that greasy, divey, hole in the wall NYC experience with a hidden entrance, with only a neon burger sign pointing the way. The interior is also decorated similar to the New York outlet.I found the burgers OK, with the ingredients fresh, the patty suitably juicy and with the necessary toppings but still lacking that distinctive taste. S$25 for a double cheeseburger is also a bit expensive. I also got the boozy (baileys) shake, which was rather thin and arrived in a small cup that set me back S$15.This place has been open less than a week and I think that they still need to get their operations ironed out. The line was extremely long, but not well managed. The trash cans were located near the front of the line, causing people to mill about and add to the crowd at the counter. It took a good 20 mins or more to receive my burger and shake.Overall, it's ok if you're coming in late in the evening, without the wait. But otherwise it's not worth squeezing with the hungry hordes to get your burger.(Full disclosure, I've not yet been to the actual NY outlet, but I'm comparing it with other burgers that I've had on the West Coast such as Umami, Super Duper, Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out.)"

The beef - US beef, good texture and flavor, and 2). Real American cheese, melted and gooey; and 3). A bun that doesn't dissolve - sorry I really can't stand all of the burger joints that use a brioche.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with the works, which was a bit messy but totally worth it.  It's a bit pricey - about $32 for burger, fries and a soda, but that seems to be the going rate around here.  And actually, it does double as a true speakeasy, as they have a well-stocked bar with a decent whiskey selection and craft beers.  As I am in the area quite frequently for bar hopping, it's nice to also find a great burger place as well.  Amoy Street keeps getting better and better!"

The place is fairly big and while slightly chaotic with orders being accepted at the food counter and then beer orders at the bar (but if you're lucky or ask nicely they may accept your food order there as well). The burgers are very good and to me are at the same quality level as the original burger joint and the beers are also excellent. What is however my main objection is the price level - count on 30+ SGD for a meal and easily well above 40 if you want beer and anything other than a basic small burger and fries.

They still have their iconic charsu bao but not enough to make up for the missing dim sum items.#TimHoWhaaaaa #TimHoWantmoreWTF!!! They don't have any napkins only wet naps which is fine but they charge for additional wet naps. Originally gave them 3 stars but downgrading to 1 star now for their service. DEFINITELY DON'T COME HERESuch a big letdown"

Tourist will find this a like a waffle-like thick pancake with fillings without the holes. Here it is made right there as the vendor sells them. She makes sure the pan is clean, and layers in the pre-mix pancake liquid mix, and while it cooks, she loads the ingredients onto the ready pancakes, cuts the pancakes in her own way of equitable sizes, shelves it in the display, and begins to hand the pancakes to the customers as they order into boxes or small plastic bags.The process probably needs re-thinking if she want to franchise (it says so right there on the signboard)Taste - it taste great, just like the many hundreds of pancakes I have had eaten before since young. The redbean filling taste just like every other redbean fillings, the peanut is fresh and crunchy, and the coconut is pretty good. For $0.80, or $0.90 for the coconut, is very reasonable."

If you order the set, hey serve this with two large runny eggs. If you do not like runny eggs, like me, you can either leave them aside or give it a try! I mixed them together and added a bit of vinegar and soy sauce hat was on the table and gave a a stir, then dipped the bread slices in it. We ordered the regular butter and the peanut butter toast and can't complain about either.The matcha frostyz was very good!

The most expensive lunch bento on the menu is $58, which is cheap compared to what I think is a like-for-like comp, Mikuni ($90). The bentos have an appealing mix of items, while the sushi and sashimi are fresh + the restaurant has thankfully avoided the 3-slices-of-salmon routine, offering more unique fishes like swordfish without additional supplements. I was also very surprised that the mostly nigiri style sushi was well made, which is something that can't be said of other Japanese restaurants in the MBFC/Raffles Area that claim to serve Japanese food. I would just avoid ordering the daily specials like the waitress suggested - we had the fried silverfish and boy was it a small platter. Service was efficient and the restaurant isn't too noisy so it is conducive for meetings. Great hidden find in the CBD area and one I'll be adding to my list of go-to business lunch places."

I think it's the best part (and I don't even like rice).we finished with a small cube of complimentary pudding, which was just that bit of sweet to finish off a good meal.service is fantastic - very attentive even if it's a little less polished than in a posher joint - and the chefs know how to have fun. it's a good friday night date!"

While other restaurants are busy opening (and closing) chain stores, Tatsu focused on maintaining their customer base at Chijmes and only recently expanded their business to serving diners in the Central Business District. Located at Asia Square Tower 2, customers will be able to enjoy 2 different dining experiences from the Sushi Bar and the dedicated Teppanyaki Performance Counter.The Sushi Bar serves fresh sashimi and sushi along with seasonal creations. The fish is air-flown multiple times a week for that extra freshness. The Omakase Sashimi ($40) is a contemporary platter with some interesting flavors. Notable were the Albacore (aka White Tuna) marinated in soy and yuzu and the superbly marbled and creamy Toro! There's something about homemade tofu with century egg sauce that drives me crazy and the one used in the Pitan Tofu ($8) dish was lightly spiced to give it that extra kick.If you would like some entertainment to go along with your meal, you would be entertained by Chef Kelvin's acrobatic cooking antics at Tatsu Teppanyaki. There were flying knives, seasoning shakers and food flying around and not to mention fire, lots of fire! If you are into rich flavors, do not miss out on the food here.The King prawn ($24) is done 2 ways. The head is flattened and grilled into a biscuit disk that crackles. The meat was tossed in an umami garlic mayonnaise with lots of fried shallots and garlic (enough to kill a vamp). Save the sauce for the other dishes, it's amazing with EVERYTHING. especially with the garlic fried rice.An A4 grade Wagyu Beef from Miyazaki Prefecture is used for the teppanyaki (200g, $168) but was sadly a little overwhelmed by the yakiniku sauce. Well, you can customize the strength of the flavors so just let the chefs know in advance.Affordable lunch and dinner sets are available at the Asia Square outlet with prices starting from $25. Bento delivery is also available in the CBD."

Lets start with the staff.  Attentive.  Friendly.  Welcoming.  Available.  Knowledgable.  Happy we are there. We were attending a special wine dinner event that was being hosted in connection with the 1855 The Bottle Wine Shop (which is conveniently attached to The Spot right there on sight behind the restaurant. Also note, there is a Macallan Boutique attached to 1855!)Since I do not eat red meat, for this special wine event, many of the dishes from my menu were replaced with fish dishes that are on their regular menu.  The one I will choose to write about is the ""Local Skate,"" which I believe is available on both their lunch menu and their dinner menu.  It is local fish, pearl rice risotto, dried sole coriander broth and salmon roe.  The flavors that exploded off this dish were so delicious.  The presentation was absolutely beautiful.  From the moment you push your fork into the plate, the colors from below spill over the edge and are so visually unexpected.  Although I am only highlighting this piece of fish, every single item we were served was equally phenomenal.  We were really impressed.  The portions of dishes are not large, but the quality is exceptional and the portions are just perfect.  Prices for appetizers items were below $20SGD.  Main dishes were $20-$30SGD.  Full bar, in addition to a good wine list.  They have a cool ambiance and warm orange/brown/gold toned decor.  There is a bar that could be a cool vibe and romantic, there is an outdoor patio with just regular high top tables for the happy hour crowd, there is a private dining room that is quite large and of course the regular dining area.  The place is upscale, classy, contemporary and cool.  We had a great first experience and look forward to returning soon.  So glad to see this in the mix of all the cool development going on in Downtown Singapore."

We didn't have to wait too long to get seated, and we were able to decide on what to order while we waited so our food was ready very quickly once we sat down. I honestly don't remember everything we had; I just ate and felt happy. There were a couple highlights though:- Xiaolongbao: delicious. I've often had xlb where the soup has leaked out by the time you eat it all. Not the case here. Full of soup, perfectly complemented by the ginger and vinegar.- Truffle xiaolongbao: If you like super strong truffle flavor, you could probably eat many of these. I could only eat one but it felt like the most decadent xlb I've ever had. - Chili crab bun: What's not to love? Chili crab combined with the fluffiest bun...heavenly. - Fried rice: I could have eaten the whole plate. Enough said. - Chocolate/red bean dumpling: I have never tried a dessert dumpling before, and I was a little skeptical of chocolate and red bean combined in a dumpling. But it was delicious. The flavors match really well and the chocolate is so nice and melty. Be sure to save room for this. Din Tai Fung really is the best and it lives up to the hype."

We visited a few Din Tai Fung restaurants when we were in Singapore and were blown away at their good quality control. At the same time we also thought that we were just lucky... ;-)Two things that we always ordered in Din Tai Fung were their shrimp & pork shao mai and of course the 18 folds original Xiao Long Bao. DTF's xiao long bao is really in the league of their own. Honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although I never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling.The shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside. I always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as I love the additional sour flavour on the meat. Of course the price of their dishes are more than the other Chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us.

I had noticed a food court level located in the same mall as the Lust store, so just took the elevetor up there and then looked at Yelp reviews and this one come up tops.Honestly, it wasn't a great first experience as when we approached the restaurant front of staff and asked about vegetarian options for my mother, the lady said there was nothing vegetarian available. But I asked to see menu and there _clearly_ were veg options that mum said she was interested in trying. So we got in and soon afterwards folks were turned away as the restaurant was closing at 10pm. We hurriedly ordered pretty much at random from the menu to be honest (and the list of foods ordered is in my photos), but gosh, all the food we got was so good and scrumptious, each bite was a delight and I walked away super happy to have had the opportunity/ chance to eat here (sometimes the food gods are truly with you!)

The salad was crunchy and delicious, with standout ingredients like bean sprouts, Korean glass noodles and vinegar, which we believe is a perfect match to create the appetite since vinegar dressing salad is our favorite. Afterwards, here came our Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Steamed Shrimp & Pork Shaomai, Steamed Vegetable & Pork Buns, and Steamed Finely Mashed Red Bean Dumplings. Of course, the spotlight should be given Xiao Long Bao. Sipping the water inside each bao is wonderful.

Wanting to see how it compares to the one in Bellevue, WA,  we had an early lunch here. We ordered:Seaweed salad and tofu with honey sauce appetizers: both were good. I had the seaweed salad before, but the tofu dish was new to me: nice way to start the meal.Fried shrimp pancake: this was new to me as well, and was my favorite dish.

I can't believe they don't have it in every major city in the world. The Pork Chop Fried Rice, Steamed garlic Spinach, Noodles with Spicy Sauce, Stuffed chillis, the DTF salad and of course, their Xiao Long Bao are all to die for. There's a lot more on the menu to choose from but those are my favourites. The waiting time can be long if you're going during the peak hours, but that's normal for any DTF in the city. The system they have keeps everything going smoothly and if you do have to wait long, it'll be worth it.The only thing that is annoying; and it seems to a problem at all of their outlets, is that most of the people working there don't speak English well. In Singapore, this should be a necessity. However, with the way ordering works, you really don't need to speak to the staff other than when you need to pay.Everyone I've taken to Din Tai Fung has loved it....and I can't imagine why you wouldn't!"

Each one is slightly different, but despite the subtle differences all of them are nothing short of amazing!! Although the prices are slightly expensive the amount of food you get is worth the price.

We arrived an hour before closing time. Before being able to order, we were told which dumplings   they had run out of. My husband does not eat meat so it wasn't nice to hear that all of the fish dumplings and most of the vegetarian options were gone. But then again we were late.So we ordered a concoction of food that was mostly noodles and veggies, and 6 pieces of crab meat & pork dumplings (for me). The order was placed shortly after 9 pm.Everyone around us seemed to be getting food (the place was relatively empty though) fast.Our first order arrived at around 9:35, everything else in about 5-minute-iterations, with a staff member asking us at 9:30 if we wanted to place a last order - which was a tad bizarre, with no other food having arrived yet. Also we had the dumpling-delivery-people stopping by our table often - only to carry on walking again after checking the contents - pretty funny, if you are NOT hungry that is. We finally had nearly all of our food (following a dumpling mix-up), when I was asked to pay and come to the till - where I had to wait for someone else to pay.Back to my- nearly cold - food, the last order arrived: the crab meat & pork dumplings, with samples of black hair. I stopped a waiter who immediately offered a replacement. That took some time, which made the whole experience very late - with the supervisor apologising profusely, for both the wait and the hair situation.All in all, food was just ok. Pretty bland.Two stars for the wait staff, one for food. I guess we just hit a bad day but I won't be back, especially since my husband found that there is a huge difference in quality between here and Taipei. Taipei it shall be then, next time :-)"

It was a small plastic cup when they showed up - but it was a relief that they gave refill regularly. The server told us that the wait for steamed dumplings would be close to an hour but they brought them out within 15 minutes. The minced pork noodles and the spicy dumplings were decent. By the way, this place did not use their colored photo menu any more. The whole operation ran on QR codes. The wait inline were automated and the menu was online.

We visited a few Din Tai Fung restaurants when we were in Singapore and were blown away at their good quality control. At the same time we also thought that we were just lucky... ;-)Two things that we always ordered in Din Tai Fung were their shrimp & pork shao mai and of course the 18 folds original Xiao Long Bao. DTF's xiao long bao is really in the league of their own. Honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although I never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling.The shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside. I always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as I love the additional sour flavour on the meat. Of course the price of their dishes are more than the other Chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us.

I had noticed a food court level located in the same mall as the Lust store, so just took the elevetor up there and then looked at Yelp reviews and this one come up tops.Honestly, it wasn't a great first experience as when we approached the restaurant front of staff and asked about vegetarian options for my mother, the lady said there was nothing vegetarian available. But I asked to see menu and there _clearly_ were veg options that mum said she was interested in trying. So we got in and soon afterwards folks were turned away as the restaurant was closing at 10pm. We hurriedly ordered pretty much at random from the menu to be honest (and the list of foods ordered is in my photos), but gosh, all the food we got was so good and scrumptious, each bite was a delight and I walked away super happy to have had the opportunity/ chance to eat here (sometimes the food gods are truly with you!)

This Taiwanese establishment is located right in the heart of Orchard area. Famously known for its Xiao Long Bao, Ding Tai Fung also features a bunch of other dimsum goodness, which we were determined to try them all out.We started with a refreshing dish of Oriental salad. The salad was crunchy and delicious, with standout ingredients like bean sprouts, Korean glass noodles and vinegar, which we believe is a perfect match to create the appetite since vinegar dressing salad is our favorite. Afterwards, here came our Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Steamed Shrimp & Pork Shaomai, Steamed Vegetable & Pork Buns, and Steamed Finely Mashed Red Bean Dumplings. Of course, the spotlight should be given Xiao Long Bao. Sipping the water inside each bao is wonderful.

I had the seaweed salad before, but the tofu dish was new to me: nice way to start the meal.Fried shrimp pancake: this was new to me as well, and was my favorite dish. Love how crispy and not greasy it was.Shrimp fried rice: standard but good.Shrimp and Chinese gourd dumplings: just ok: not that big of a fan of the gourd.Chili crab bun: this was really good, but you order them one each (should have gotten another one).Overall, very similar to the Din Tai Fung's in the US. No wait to be seated, but we did have a long wait for our food, though."

There's a lot more on the menu to choose from but those are my favourites. The waiting time can be long if you're going during the peak hours, but that's normal for any DTF in the city. The system they have keeps everything going smoothly and if you do have to wait long, it'll be worth it.The only thing that is annoying; and it seems to a problem at all of their outlets, is that most of the people working there don't speak English well. In Singapore, this should be a necessity.

We arrived an hour before closing time. Before being able to order, we were told which dumplings   they had run out of. My husband does not eat meat so it wasn't nice to hear that all of the fish dumplings and most of the vegetarian options were gone. But then again we were late.So we ordered a concoction of food that was mostly noodles and veggies, and 6 pieces of crab meat & pork dumplings (for me). The order was placed shortly after 9 pm.Everyone around us seemed to be getting food (the place was relatively empty though) fast.Our first order arrived at around 9:35, everything else in about 5-minute-iterations, with a staff member asking us at 9:30 if we wanted to place a last order - which was a tad bizarre, with no other food having arrived yet. Also we had the dumpling-delivery-people stopping by our table often - only to carry on walking again after checking the contents - pretty funny, if you are NOT hungry that is. We finally had nearly all of our food (following a dumpling mix-up), when I was asked to pay and come to the till - where I had to wait for someone else to pay.Back to my- nearly cold - food, the last order arrived: the crab meat & pork dumplings, with samples of black hair. I stopped a waiter who immediately offered a replacement. That took some time, which made the whole experience very late - with the supervisor apologising profusely, for both the wait and the hair situation.All in all, food was just ok. Pretty bland.Two stars for the wait staff, one for food. I guess we just hit a bad day but I won't be back, especially since my husband found that there is a huge difference in quality between here and Taipei. Taipei it shall be then, next time :-)"

We were really hungry and decided to try out this restaurant. I've came across Din Tai Fung many times when shopping at Level 4. However, my mom and I never tried the restaurant because the waiting queue is usually really long. It was not until my dad said that Din Tai Fung is a really good restaurant from Taiwan and encouraged us to try it that we finally had dinner there.The food is delicious! You have to try the xiao long bao (juicy pork dumplings) there, or you'll be missing out! It's the juiciest, most delicious dumplings I've ever had. What special about xiao long bao is that there is a little bit of soup inside the dumplings. Dip the dumpling inside soy sauce and vinegar, add a little bit of the ginger (yes you'll be missing out too if you don't eat it with ginger), and it will simply melt in your mouth. We ordered several other dishes, such as pork shop fried rice, shaomai, bean sauced noodle, drunken chicken, and tofu appetizer. They're all delicious. I also love the refreshing dried longan drink. I was looking for it at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, California, but unfortunately they don't have it there :(. Since then, whenever we visit Singapore, we always come to Din Tai Fung. The food is definitely worth the long wait. Besides, there are a few shops around that you could go to while waiting for your number to be called. The kitchen is also see-through, if you want to see how the dumplings are made. Personally, I prefer this Din Tai Fung more than the ones in California because there are more choices available, especially the longan drink (although my favorite Din Tai Fung has to be the one in Taiwan)."

I've tried their duo miao and their pancake stuff, all pretty decent. The other dumplings aren't really as good, so I would stick to the traditional ones. If you're looking for a truly Asian experience, a friend told me the proper wait to eat these dumplings are to dab some black vinegar on using the ginger provided, bite off the top of the dumpling, sip the soup, and then put the rest of the dumpling in your mouth. All in all, the food is excellent and tasty. My only complaint would be on the service. There was once I asked for a bit more sauce as I prefer my items a bit on the ""wet"" side, but was told by the waiter that I couldn't have it. When I insisted that another outlet had allowed me to do it, it had to escalate to a manager level where although I was given more sauce, I was told in a very ""you-better-don't-ask-again-tone"" that they are making an exception and that I should not ask for things out of the ordinary the next time. I mean, this is just sauce. You don't have to make people feel terrible for asking for more sauce? That's just my opinion. Warning: seating may sometimes take a while. Arrive early. Take a number. Bring something to do just in case."

I was torn between letting it happen, or scheming up an escape... but then I thought: why spoil the moment? So I caved and let the XLB do to me what it was meant to; I bit into the plump dumpling, and was I was warned about the hot soup... but gladly got scalded any how. And the flavour... I haven't had any better, and after visiting even the other branches of this store, I don't think I will. Maybe the hands here are magic after all.Being caught up in the fantasy world that is XLB, it's hard to look around you and notice anything else, but of course, when you come up for air, everything is as it should be - the wait staff are mega speedy, and relatively polite (they say hi when they stop by to drop off each dish), they top up your tea often, and it just seems like a well-oiled machine. Before you think XLB is everything that they serve (but it should be), there is a sizeable menu of things that include a super tasty pork chop fried rice, and a mystery mix of veggies called ""xiao cai"".

It is an interesting natural ""fusion"" of Chinese food with the surrounding cultures of Singapore. It's melting pot of spices and dishes.We tried a huge spread of food. The most interesting is a chicken dish called Ayam Buah Keluak, braised chicken flavoured with turmeric, galangal and lemongrass cooked with Indonesian black nuts (Buah Keluak nuts). These nuts are actually poisonous if not fermented and slowly cooked underground in coal. Believe it or not they contain cyanide . I guess it's akin to eating blowfish in Japan? It had a deep earthy and umami taste almost like a mushroom of some sort. Anyway, I am glad to have tried this cuisine as it is hard to find outside of Singapore"

The food is definitely above average but I would say that it lacks the surprises I get from Candlenut where I feel the presentation of the food and the combination of ingredients and flavors are all perfect.  It is definitely not bad but is also not my go-to place.  Nevertheless, it's a good option considering the lower prices in general."

A particularly easy place for Westerners to dine as the menu is varied without being too extensive, and the descriptions are well written with certain items identified as special recommendations. The price level is higher than what you would expect at a 'local joint' but less than those of many of the other 'westernised' eateries' we visit. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, but stand outs were the whole sambal fish, the chicken rolls and the prawns. The whole fish is a little intimidating when it first arrives at the table but just get stuck in! The sweet sambal over the crispy fried skin... dericious! I also am a sucker for sago pudding with gula melaka... not bad here, but the sago had congealed a bit more than necessary and I prefer it without the ice shavings. Service is polite and attentive. Decor is a bit dated (I thought) but in keeping with a traditionalist theme and  far from off-putting. Their wine and beer list could probably be widened a bit more, especially wine by the glass. We spent $60 per person for starters, mains and two drinks each. I think this is a great place to bring visitors to give them a taste of peranakan cuisine. Next I want to try Peranaman and then off to Melaka for the graduation of peranakan cuisine!"

The food is definitely above average but I would say that it lacks the surprises I get from Candlenut where I feel the presentation of the food and the combination of ingredients and flavors are all perfect.  It is definitely not bad but is also not my go-to place.  Nevertheless, it's a good option considering the lower prices in general."

No matter: the result is excellent. I had chicken in an Indonesian sauce based on nuts I did not know but that were delicious - chocolate like (ayam buah keluak), and my companion had pork knuckles braised to perfection in another herb mix (babi hong).

I am not going to lie...this place will set you back a few bucks.  But I still would not take back my 5 star Yelp review, because we felt the customer service and the quality was absolutely there.  But what do I know really.  I am a white girl, from the Midwest of America (Indiana to be exact) and really only gage my Indian food by the quality of the take out from the corner food stahl down the street of wherever I am living.  I say this only partially joking.  I do like Indian food and I will eat it from the street stahl and the fine dining experience and know enough to know the difference.  Even with that, I still give the Punjab Grill a 5 star on Yelp. My husband and I were there on a Monday night, so maybe the quiet Monday night setting set it up for better quality customer service.  Regardless, we felt welcomed and waiting on hand and foot for the entire time we were there.  The dining room space is unexpected, being appointed with a contemporary feel, out of the blue being more intimate than we anticipated, with lots of glass and mirrors and more tastefully done than we had foreseen.  The setting almost does not feel like an Indian spot, but it was a nice touch to the ambiance of our experience.  You could be dressed up or more business casual, the attire could run the gamut a bit.  The ambiance is not stuffy and over the top in any way.  There is a little chef hat next to each food item that is recommended by the chef, so we went with six items that all had the little chef hat (if you don't know what to order, order what the chef is guiding you towards - always a good rule of thumb!).  For our first time here, it was a great way to taste what they considered their best items.  We were not disappointed.  From salmon tkka to Paneer Lababdar, we were savoring every bite.  If I knew this was my last day on earth, I might request the Bharwaan Khumb Peshawari.  No joke!  It is that tasty....like mushroom/cheese/melty ecstasy really!  Really really delicious and worth every penny!  Temperatures, preparation and presentation was all spot on.  I think this is not only my first 5 star Yelp review for an Indian restaurant, I know this is my first 5 star Yelp review in Singapore.  And although I know there will be more in time (I don't hand them out readily), I am thrilled to have experienced Punjab Grill and it was my first.  We will happily be back."

It seems they haven't cleaned the glasses for ages.Our disappointment reached another level when food started coming in. I think we made a big mistake coming here given that there are other good indian restaurants around here in Singapore. The only thing we liked was the sorbet after starters which was supposed to clear your throat. Not to mention their service is way too slow to be acceptable.

We ended up going to this place by chance but were so glad we did. Let's start with the ambience. the lighting was perfect and our host greeted us enthusiastically and happily. We especially loved the decorations on the walls and the amazing chandeliers. Now to the food, we ordered the power lunch which we thought was expensive at 40 bucks a plate but it turned out to be one of the best meals we've had in quite some time. They give you three starters to start with. One paneer that melts in your mouth, one sabudana vada, and one kathi roll. All were good. They also give you an aloo bonda on a curved fork. All of this was topped off with a pineapple sorbet to Cleanse the palette. The main course was three vegetable dishes rice and naan. One of these dishes was a paneer dish. It was simply out of this world. There was also a dum aloo dish, it was tasty and spicy. The final dish was a five daal dish. Good but unremarkable. the rice was hot and fluffy.  The naan was well made and soft. The dessert was again three separate dishes - gulab jamun, kheer, and raspberry chocolate cheesecake. Amazing, amazing, amazing! My husband still cant shut up about the amazing compressed napkin. They put a mint in front of you, pour some water on it and turn it into a marshmallow.  Before you know it its rolling out into a scented wet towel to wipe your hands with. The entire show is pretty epic. All in all a five star experience, no doubt about it."

WOW. I haven't had fish that good in a while.For the main we had rice with grilled trava fish in a mustard sauce, lamb in  nice gravy, rice, and dal.  We got extra of the dal.  They offered extra of everything for the main course but we were so full we couldn't even think about eating more meat.  So just enough dal was put on our plates to clean up with the garlic naan.  We love naan.We thought the meal ended with the desserts: Indian ice cream pistachio, rice pudding, and carrot halwa.  They all tasted very traditional but were good.My one and only criticism is that the music is a bad piano laden karaoke soundtrack. It should be immediately replaced by a man in the corner playing a sitar.  I'm not kidding.  It might break with the modern esthetic of the place but it will be SO MUCH BETTER.Luckily for the meal and the end of this review the meal actually ended with a shot of Betel leave and ice cream.  It was a super cool finish and very tasty.  Much better than trying betel nut on its own."

And let me tell you, I still crave their ramen until this very day.I got there around 7pm and queue wasn't too long but it is evident that this place is popular as it was packed! What was nice is that they offer free iced Oolong tea outside of the restaurant while you wait. They offer a good variety of ramen from their Ramen Special to Black Spicy to Tsuke men. I ended up getting the Green Spicy Ramen with all toppings and my friend got their Maze Soba. You got to pick the level of soup oil you wanted, saltiness, and firmness of your noodles. Service was quick and while we waited, we grinded some sesame. They also offer unlimited hard boiled eggs, great for those who are a bit hungry and can't wait for their food to come out.When I first tasted my Green Spicy Ramen, oh man... I was pretty much in ramen heaven. The broth was so elegant and had a super nice wasabi flavor. Noodles were made to my liking (I ordered normal). They gave me a good amount of toppings- their eggs and chicken bone were my favorite. I usually don't finish my ramen as the soup is usually quite filling for me. But this time, I made sure to eat every last bite as this was a ramen that I know I can't find else where. As for the Maze Soba, I only took a bite of my friend's and can't quite remember how I liked it but my friend finished it in a heartbeat so I guess that's a good sign lol.Place is also a trendier ramen place with a big community table in the middle and flags + vibrant decorations all around. Great place to hit up after work with your colleagues or catch up with your friends. Highly recommend giving this place a try. Looking forward to the day when I go back to Singapore to eat this ramen again!!!"

The dipping sauce was rich and creamy with lots of dried fish flakes and chicken cubes in it. It's signature grilled chicken leg was quite tender but I felt the size of the leg seem to have reduced. I remembered that it used to be quite big.

Similar to the chicken cha shu at Ramen Keisuke Lobster King (another outlet under Ramen Keisuke), there was alcoholic taste which mean that the cha shu could have marinated in sake.Overall the ramen were much better than what I had during my last visit."

Was also a bit confused as the signage at the front of the restaurant said ""Kanezin Japan Singapore"" until I saw the menu which confirmed that I was at the right restaurant!Once inside, you will be greeted by their friendly staff (in Japanese of course) and ushered to your seats. Directly in front in a long table which seats 14 people (7 on each side) with all the condiments laid out in the middle. On the right are about four 4 seater tables, some of whih can be further split to fit 2 people. On the left just facing the kitchen are 5 counter seats for those who would like to be close to the action and smell the aromas coming out from the kitchen. When you sit down, you will be given the menu and also a white order form and a pen. You can go through the menu to look at the pictures and descriptions before writing down your orders. For the regulars, they will just go straight to the order form and pen down their orders directly. The order form is quite straightforward, on the top row (Step 1) are their ramen broth choices (Tori King Ramen is the original chicken based broth, Black Spicy (black pepper) Tori King Ramen is my favourite which comes in a dark spicy broth, Green spicy(wasabi) tori king ramen, Tori King Special TanTan Mein is limited to 20 bowls per day, and finally the Kids Meal with Toy & Juice.You can then choose if you want to add additional half noodles, noodles, or soup.Step 2, you can choose your favourite topping of seaweed, flavoured egg (with mushy yolk), pork, or the special which means all 3 items. If you cannot decide, just choose special!Step 3, choose the flavour of soup (light, normal, strong), chicken oil (no oil, less oil, normal, more), and noodle texture (hard, normal, soft).Step 4, finally you can then select which items which you do not want, such as no spring onions, no deep fried onions, or no black fungus.For egg and bean sprout  fans, you will be happy to hear that there is free flow of hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts at each table. There are both brown and white eggs, and no, it doesnt matter which colour eggs you choose, its all the same on the inside! There is a little sign on the big long table to use the tissue for your egg shells. Maybe its so its easier for the staff to clean up afterwards. There is also a small bowl of white and black sesame seeds and a small wooden grinder which you can use to grind your own sesame seeds if you so wish to. There are also other condiments such as soy sauce, bonito flakes, chilli flakes.  The chicken that came with the noodles is very juicy and the meat just fell off the bone! By the way, you can just buy the chicken leg for takeaway at S$6 each. The broth is wonderfully thick and rich and you get that sticky aftertaste at the end of the meal. They really have boiled the broth for a very long time to get this kind of flavour and taste. Definitely a place to come back to!"

My favorite in past memory was from Totto Ramen, which managed to create an incredibly comforting flavor that was also rich and complex. The line was about 40 mins long on a Wednesday evening around peak dinner time (7:30pm), but since I didn't know when I would be back in the area, I decided to brave the wait. I liked that the bowl was customizable on several variables: the saltiness, strength of broth and oil, chewiness of the noodles, and toppings. I ordered the Tori King Ramen non-clear soup and stuck to the normal/standard for everything, which runs for S$11.90++. Though soft-boiled egg isn't included in a standard order, they do have FREE UNLIMITED hard-boiled eggs and bean sprouts. A soft-boiled egg is a must have though, and it really should've been included. You could also grind your own sesame seeds to add into the soup, which was a nice touch.The normal texture noodle was already quite chewy and I liked that they used the wavy style of ramen. However, the broth tasted just like CHICKEN SKIN FAT. One redeeming factor is that they claim the soup has lots of collagen in it, but it still felt like it was clogging my arteries. Rather than the chicken soup for the soul type of flavor I was looking for, this had the very raw, chicken-fat-under-the-skin type of flavor, which is actually what I can't stand. Maybe I'd prefer having no chicken oil at all, but the regular tori broth just wasn't for me. I also ordered a wasabi ginger ale, which was intriguing, but the wasabi was hardly noticeable and not worth the purchase."

Usually, it's too mild, sometimes even close to tasting like nothing. And then here comes Tori King - the chicken ramen game changer.Just like any other Keisuke, you would order it based on a sheet, choosing which one you'd like, texture of noodle, amount of oil, what kind of garnishes you'd like, and if you want any extra toppings, like getting an ajitama egg or the special (all the works). It also has free flow hardboiled eggs and beansprouts.I chose the Tori King - the classic chicken ramen which a rich broth, because you know I'm all about creamy broths. One of the first things that you would notice is that every single bowl comes with a giant chicken leg that is so well cooked that you could still taste the crispy skin on the leg. The ajitama that I ordered with my ramen came perfectly cooked, almost as if the hallmark of the perfect bowl of chicken ramen.While this was a great bowl of ramen, I still generally prefer the pork based broths. If you've been burned before by another chicken ramen (looking at you marutama), and have given up all hope on chicken broth ramens, I'd definitely suggest Tori King, to maybe help raise some hopes for chicken broth kind."

I'm actually the person that entered the business into the system. Frankly, I did so with the intent of providing a fairly negative review -- but I see some diligent Yelpers beat me to it. Either way, here it goes:The food is actually relatively good. Not great -- just good. It's seemingly a sort of fusion Malay/Straits cuisine mixed with Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian influence. The view is also quite nice, as it is in the top of one of the Supertree structures at Singapore's new Gardens by the Bay (worth a visit). Likewise, the bar one floor up provides a good vista.That's the good news. Here is the rest of the story:1. The prices are outrageous. Our bill for three dishes and soup (excluding drinks and no alcohol) came to over S$125. This is particularly egregious in a food paradise of a city where you can get better at hawker centers for $2-$5 per plate easily. Even fairly upscale restaurants in the malls won't run nearly that much. So these prices are for food that was probably in the bottom 25% for taste on our trip to Singapore -- a city with which I am a fairly regular visitor.2. The ""admission"" to get to the restaurant is S$10/person. Keep in mind that this isn't deducted from the price of the meal if you eat at the restaurant. Since this is an attraction (the Supertree-top view) I could see charging admission if people wanted to just go up and hang out; but really if we are eating there and paying beyond-top-dollar in their restaurant, it should be applied toward that. I've eaten at a few ""tower"" restaurants around the world in buildings/structures that required entrance fee and in every case they apply the ""ticket"" cost to the bill if you actually patronize their restaurant.What does come with that S$10 ticket? A voucher for soda. Not alcohol, but soda. I had eaten there, despite hesitation from my wife, because Gardens by the Bay is essentially a botanical theme park, and I had expected to be a little overcharged due to the captive audience effect common to these types of facilities. But it was too much gouging, and we left feeling distinctly fleeced.Gardens by the Bay is a fantastic attraction, and obviously a lot of loving care went into its creation. I therefore understand why they might rent the restaurant space in the Supertree to Indochine to make up some of the cost and help pay its way. However, given the restaurant's extortionate pricing and admission, I think the Garden should consider if it's worth having otherwise happy guests leave with this sour taste in their mouths.Honestly, the value makes it definitely one-star, but in fairness I gave it a ""2"" for the ""3"" level of the food."

I would say it's the worst food for whole lot of money. We ordered a bottle of cheap wine for 105 dollars.  It needed to breathe a little but  our waiter started to pour into our glasses right away while my husband was trying to tell him to wait.  My husband and friend ordered lemongrass sea bass and I ordered tiger prawn and pomelo salad while other friend ordered Vietnamese style beef.  I almost fell out of my chair when I saw my salad. It said tiger prawn but it was more like kitten shrimp. I m not joking about the size of three shrimp that as in the salad.  When I questioned the size after I saw someone next to me ordering different tiger prawn dish which was decent size, they said because mine was salad.  Sure, since I must look stupid that I should accept that answer. The dressing on the salad did not go well with pomelo since it was Vietnamese fish sauce dressing.  With most being the pomelo, and the small portion I still couldn't finish it because it was so salty and overwhelming smell of fish sauce. When it was time for our check, they informed us we need to spend 70 more dollars since it's required to spend at least 80 per person.  Since we know the quality of the food and the taste, our guys decided in couple of cognacs which was 28 dollars each. It must have been a joke because the serving size was a barely a sip.   I understand that they must have to pay high rent to charge so much but the serving sizes there was a joke as well as the waiters and rest of the working staff.  They were not trained to recommend or tell us about the spending until we got the check, they didn't know who ordered what so they try to give me my husbands dish,  they were not informed about the wine to let it breathe, trying to explain why my tiger prawn was so small compare to other people's tiger prawns dish by telling me because mine was a salad.  The service staff isn't well trained for the place where they charge so much money for not so edible good.

However you can get to the top bar without one by paying 40 Singapore Dollars for 2 drinks. It was expensive but the views from the top were worth the price in our opinion. You can stay on the roof as long as you want with just these two drinks and this place is not as crowded as Skypark Observation Deck.However it is better to watch free Light and Sound Show from the ground level.

We had been told it was worth the expense. We wanted to take on nice views of Singapore and basically indulge ourselves, so we were willing to spend more than usual.The restaurant has a nice environment, but the view from inside is rather mediocre. To begin with, there's too much light inside, so most of what we could see through the glass was a reflection of what was happening behind us. The menu is extensive and consists of modern Western and Southeast Asian dishes. The food is, in fact, good (not impressive) and (mostly) worth the price. We had a tasty dinner prepared with quality ingredients and good flavours. So far, so good. The problem comes with the drinks or, to be more specific, with certain drinks. We found that beer and wine are exceedingly overpriced. I'm talking SGD $15++ for a miserable half pint (yes, half) of Tiger, and red wine for no less than SGD $105++ a bottle. On the other hand, single malts or good vodkas cost around SGD $18 a shot, which is, in fact, cheaper than many other places I've visited in Singapore. So, the key is to read the drinks menu and choose carefully.The rooftop bar is where the good view is. It has a very relaxed vibe, a mostly tourist-looking crowd, and chill-out music that is easy to ignore. The food menu for the bar seems like  overpriced bar food, so it should be avoided. We stayed there for a few drinks and enjoyed ourselves. I'm giving it three stars because of that, maybe my good mood clouds my judgement.My recommendation for the best experience would be to visit the rooftop bar just before sunset and enjoy the views while having drinks, then maybe have dinner at the restaurant, and leave rather early to enjoy and take a few pictures of Gardens By the Bay at night, which is the real treat."

You could probably skip the restaurant...The restaurant review: The food is actually not bad. I really like this dish that has lychee with pork loin - a very interesting (in a good way) combination. With that said, the price here is still unjustifiable.The bar review: We didn't have to pay an entrance fee (maybe because we were dining at the restaurant). I believe if you pay you will get a wrist bracelet that gives you a complimentary drink. We ended up ordering a glass of wine ($19) and a cocktail ($20+). I like the chill vibe of this rooftop bar. It is like a casual/unfancy version of Lantern at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. I like that it is uncovered and that I could smell the freshness from the gardens and the sea breeze.Overall yes it is overpriced but if you're looking for a chilled and relaxing bar with a view then I think it's the place :)"

However, for those who have too little time to look at the botanical gardens or who would rather invest the admission money in a drink, the Super Trees will be the place to be, as they are the highlight of the gardens. The plants-covered steel frames are between 25 and 50 meters high. They are used for the breeding of rare plants and at night lit by solar power. Rain is collected in their funnels for the irrigation of the plants. Some of the trees serve as cooling towers for the cooling systems of the garden's domes. Two of the towers are connected with a bridge at a staggering height.In one of the trees you will find the Indochine, a restaurant with a cocktail lounge on the roof terrace, from where you can enjoy a spectacular view onto the city."

We had to walk five feet to the bar/service terminal to 1. ask to order, 2. ask for our drinks, 3. ask for tap water (which they didn't want to serve us without paying for it), and 4. ask to pay our bill. Just terrible. Food was decent but costly ($90 for four plates, understandable considering the locale) but drinks were weak and offered almost no choices: one basic rail/cheap alcohol with one mixer for $18 (gin & tonic, whiskey & coke, etc.) The bar is completely outdoors so if it's too hot or too cold you're fully exposed with no wind barrier, no fans, no ac, no shade. Even the view is better from the OCDC Sky Bridge below. Skip this unnecessary and poorly run bar in the sky, especially considering the worst service we've seen anywhere in Asia in 25 years.

I believe that one goes to this restaurant simply for the view and the setting; the food is good, but nothing amazing. Upon entering the entire wait staff greets you as you walk in from the elevator. The decor reminds me a bit of a Vegas casino...flashy. It's an odd system, they have you select and order from an iPad,  but then you still have to call your server over to confirm the order. Then upon the server placing the order, the iPad is taken away and paper menus were brought out later when we asked about dessert. The food comes with a hefty price tag and the taste does not merit that price tag in my opinion. We split a starter platter for appetisers. I had the portobello mushroom for dinner (it was ok). My husband had the lamb which he really enjoyed. We had the coffee creme brûlée for dessert. It was actually really good. We enjoyed going up to the rooftop bar (which was closed due to weather) to take pictures and our daughters also enjoyed going down for the fantastic light show. I am very grateful we had the opportunity to try SuperTree, but once was just fine."

It was a 3 course lunch set which costs $40++ and was served with a glass of Rive Gauche Merlot or Colombard Chardonnay. I selected the Rive Gauche Merlot which tasted quite smooth down the throat. The meal started with the bread basket and some butter. The butter was in a coin shape with the fullerton logo in the center. The butter was not too salty and quite well with the soft chewy slice of bread. There was also a baguette in the bread basket which I felt was a tab too crusty and hard for me. I was served the charcuterie with the bread basket. There was 3 kinds of cuts and pates in the charcuterie plate.Frisee SaladLardon, Poached Eggs, Cheese Shavings, Raspberry VinaigretteThe cheese shavings tasted a tab strong at the beginning but it was soon balanced off the sour raspberry.Signature Duck ConfitLentils Gremolade, Potatoes RatteThe lentils balanced the slightly salty duck confit. Interestingly the dish was served with raw spinach, tossed with fried sweet onions.Creme BruleeVanilla Bourbon Creme Brulee, Blueberries CompoteThe creme brulee was not too sweet, and it was balanced by the sour tasting compote.I ended the meal with Petit Fours which consisted of praline chocolates, macarons, and kueh lapis, accompanied with a cup of English Breakfast Tea.The serving looked small but were quite filling. Service was great with staffs checking on me often, although I wished for a refill of ice water. The restaurant was quite busy as it was packed with customers having the Sunday Brunch Buffet.

Well i've now found another reason to love them better with the newly refurbished French restaurant La Brasserie. Enjoy your customized Gin & Tonic ($19) as you enjoy the sunset from the opulent surrounding. I don't drink enough G&T but this was pretty refreshing.The French brasserie classics and dishes here have the hallmark of 'cuisine du soleil'. This 'cuisine of the sun' is the representative food of the South of France, a region that is said to be blessed with the sun for 330 days of the year. It is a cuisine characterized by Mediterranean flavours and a lighter touch.Start with a hearty Traditional Onion Soup ($19) which is a caramelized sweet onion soup made with beef stock. The beef bones are first boiled with trimmings without fat for at least 4 hours, and then combined with caramelized white onions for another 3 hours. The hard work culminates into a sweet hearty broth. It's topped with a day-old sourdough with gruyere cheese that has been gratinated under the salamander. Eat it quick before the bread turns soggy!We tasted the Mediterranean influence in the Aubergine Caviar Tartine ($19). The Mediterranean black eggplant is whole baked until completely charred, then served with a sweet Roma tomato confit, buffalo mozzarella and extremely crunchy olive oil pan-seared Poilâne bread. The crunch could be heard from miles away. The signature Lobster and Scallop Carpaccio ($33) has been on the menu since the restaurant opened in 2010. The slippery slivers of hand-dived Hokkaido scallop and sweet 'live' Boston lobster are dressed with black truffle oil and lime juice. Hot Smoked Balik Salmon ($21) is one of my favorite starters here. The NZ king salmon is cured with salt and smoked over Japanese binchotan charcoal for a flavorful smokiness! The torched exterior parted to reveal a delicate pink center which is so good on its own. Enhance the flavors with the red onion compote and creme fraîche. Suprême de Canard Confit ($39) with Beluga Lentils and crisp salad is a signature at La Brasserie. I remember not being too wowed by it the last time I had it but the dish seemed to be have improved. The cured duck leg had enough flavor from the salt and fat while retaining a nice meaty texture. Grilled Côte de Boeuf ($99 for two persons). The gorgeous slab of rib-eye is first grilled in a Josper over binchotan and black cherry wood and then basted with a thyme butter! The juicy buttery meat is good on its own and there's no need for the wide variety of mustard, salts, and sauces.Add on sides of potato gratin ($9) or sautéed peas ($9) with lardon to go with the meat. I hate peas but these were so poppingly delightful. I would certainly order the Lobster a L'Americaine ($68) every time i dine here. You can smell the umami fragrance of that Roma tomato, fresh basil, and lobster base sauce. The angel hair pasta is tossed in with the sauce and the thin noodles absorbed all that lovely flavors. I can finish a pot of this i swear.New additions to the refreshed menu are the selection of gluten and dairy-free buckwheat Galettes ($23/ $28 with a cider). I found the La Complete Galette with Paris ham, Gruyere cheese, and organic egg quite pedestrian. The Louis Ralson Original Crisp cider ($17) cider fared better on its own. Definitely have the Profiteroles ($13) piped with creme patisserie and topped with Chantilly cream and warm chocolate sauce. The double Tahitian vanilla ice cream is out of this world and contrasts with the eggy custard in the airy puffs. It's made even better with the rich 55% Valrhona chocolate sauce which has a nice acidity to it.Also make room for the Tarte Tatin ($32 for two to four persons) which features soft caramelized Granny Smith apples baked in caramel and topped on a mille feuille base. Each guest is served a scoop of ice cream after the pie is sliced table side! I have so much love for the dishes here at La Brasserie. Plus Fullerton Bay Hotel is such a gorgeous place to hang out at. If I were working in the area, I'll definitely go for the set lunches which start from $38. Also, it's possible to take away some of those lovely Western and Asian sweets at the brand new Fullerton Boutique located at the restaurant entrance leading from the hotel. P.s. The Fullerton Kueh Lapis is quite sedap."

There is smoking area as well.What more - well there are the views across Marina Bay which themselves are stunning. What a magnificent experience! I'll be back to try the food."

However these are more than made up for by its great service, food and ambience. It has high ceilings and muted lighting as befits a haute cuisine restaurant. The duck confit was likely one of the most flavourful I've taste and the lamb rack was tasty too. However the steaks with frites was somewhat overcooked and hard; however once we fed back to the maître d' / sommelier (an Indian gentleman) he promptly replaced it.  I would like to commend him for his great service and attentiveness throughout. The complimentary ""slice"" of birthday cake for my wife was surprisingly large and 2 trays of macaroni/kueh lapis/chocolates were provided gratis too. The whole experience was topped up by a photo card of my family with the birthday cake. The final bill was not too cheap but still very reasonable for the fine dining experience (we were stuffed!) which included a glass of Chilean wine. I highly recommend this place for someone looking for good food, service and refined ambience."

Was a wee bit put off by the fact that we would need to wait for dinner when we are that early... but as it turns out, the only seat complete parties, so we were good. Menu is simple enough - meat with cheese, meat without cheese, kids menu. 5 different gravy to choose from - though it was flavourful enough without the gravy. Set comes with one deep fried breaded prawn (yummy), rice and soup. You also have the option to add on extra meat and prawn (can't remember the price). We all ordered meat with cheese and all of us were happy with it. The set also comes with unlimited salad and unlimited eggs. UNLIMITED EGGS!!!! Sunny side up, soft boil, hard boil, omelette, scrambled - you name it and they cook it for you. Salad bar is kept nicely chilled - fresh and colourful. There were also 2-3 different types of cold noodles at the salad bar. For dessert (also at salad bar) you gave oranges, watermelon and coffee jelly with cream (I usually take espresso/ Americano and still felt that the coffee jelly was bitter!). A few things to note (I) CASH ONLY - we ordered the set plus a coke each and we paid $29 each. (ii) make sure all your group/party is present or you won't get seated (iii) they allow you to charge your phone at the table, and you can ask for a cable (in exchange with your IC) too (iv) they do give you a bib but since it not exactly sizzling, you don't really need it. (V) soft boiled eggs may be slightly too raw... Generally an overall good experience ... and a very very full experience :)"

They're slippery, moist, soft and topped with diced preserved radish and you can also add chili oil on top. I'm not usually the one for spiciness, but I tolerated that one and in fact, it MADE the dish for me. I could taste dried shrimp in the topping too, which reminded me of bagoong! Haha. The lines for Jian Bo is a testament their popularity and they're really the best in the island.  S$2.50 for 5 pieces is not a bad price for a snack. I can't imagine that Singaporeans really have this for breakfast since it's a very indulgent treat. Despite that, I loved it so much because the texture reminded me of Filipino ""Kutsinta"" and it you've had this dessert, well, the shui keuh is the savory version of it. 5 deliciously cheap stars!"

""Chye poh"" which actually refers specifically to one of the main ingredients of this condiment, preserved diced Chinese radish.  Although technically a condiment, the ""chye poh"" is in my humble opinion, the star.  Chwee Kueh lives or dies on the quality of the ""chye poh"".  Jian Bo's version is outstanding!  The diced preserved radish is stir-fried with sesame seeds and I suspect in sesame oil.  This elevates the two-dimensional saltiness of the pickled vegetable, giving it all kinds of interesting new flavor profiles with nutty, toasty and buttery notes.  Absolute genius.  I'm not the only one who thinks so, customers typically request extra servings of the condiment. The fine folks at Jian Bo are more than happy to accommodate cravings for their famous condiment.  At $3 for a small container, you'd be hurting from the gouging if this wasn't just simply phenomenal!  I usually just pony up because the ""chye poh"" will also elevate another quotidian standard, ""chye poh neng"" or ""chye poh"" omelette, although frittata is more technically appropriate.  The ""chili"" or ""hot sauce"" is the spice that wakes up the palate.  This is also good, but a certainly less famous member of the entourage, just like Johnny Drama, full of wannabe angst, with anger management issues. It's dried chilies stir-fried with dried shrimps...what's not to like??  The ratios of condiments with each cake are hotly debated and a matter of personal preference and orientation.  At the end of the day, you find what you like, make your peace and keep your mouth shut about whether you think this is better than your cousin's mix.  It's not as contentious as Jameson versus Bushmills, but it's pretty close.At the end of the day, it's all about visiting a Singapore landmark, Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre, ordering up 10 of these lovely creamy rice cakes for less than $4 (at the time of this writing), and enjoying each cake doused with a heaping helping of the aforementioned ""condiments"" and letting the lied of legacy flavors play soothingly in your head.  And may I make so bold as to suggest an intermission of a sip of local milk tea and then letting that music continue to play to an audience of one.Of course, there's also Hai San and Tiong Bahru Fried Kway Teow in the house, so remember to leave enough room for a whole orchestra of flavors to flood your head."

Prices are pretty decent here, considering that it's located at Robinson road / Shenton Way. Located at OUE's swanky new lifestyle hub Downtown Gallery, Wafuken is a little outlet serving some really yummy healthy food. Ordering is simple enough, staring with your protein of choice, followed by side (carbs) with the choice of more sides ranging from Wafu Salad to Onsen Egg. Prices here start at $4 for a half portion of chicken (which is a lot by the way) to $30 for a full serving of Wagyu rump (200g). Carbs are averagely at $2 while add one range from $1 to $2.50.The chicken was sous-vide and was very tender and moist and I liked how it was not over complicated by seasonings, allowing the natural flavor of the chicken to shine. The dory was surprisingly good. A lot of times, places who use dory tend to serve it broiled (more like boiled), with the fish turning mushy and blend. Here however, the dory is lightly seasoned and pan seared very well, giving it a slight crust while remaining tender and juicy. The salmon too was cooked perfectly. The outside was firm while the inside remained moist and juicy. Perfectly cooked salmon! I've tried both the soba and the Furikake Japanese Rice and they both didn't disappoint but if you're going for the rice, than the onsen egg is A MUST!The yolk was thick and rich and really helped bond the rice and protein together, making it a smooth, rich combination that makes you crave for more! Paired with a crisp and  refreshing wafu salad, it made this dish incredibly mouth watering and satisfying. Overall, the experience was fantastic and it's a great place to grab a healthy meal at decent prices, while chilling with friends."

My favourite is definitely the Phad Thai. The quality and consistency of the food has always been the same plus it has heaps of tofu and beansprouts to give it texture. The olive fried rice came way too salty once but normally it's really nice cuz it's packed with cashew nuts. The only downside about this place is that it does take a while for your food to arrive especially during lunch time, and even when it's not crowded. So be aware of that when you check this place out. If you work around the area, you can also call them up and place and order for delivery. So far, it seems like there's no minimum order if you're in the immediate vicinity. Plus point for those working late or hanging out at the pubs around the corner."

I have also tried their Phad Thai and it is also not bad. The phad thai are nicely fried with a generous amount of beansprout, eggs and tofu cubes. But for me, I am more partial to their garlic chicken rice and it's oily goodness. The garlic are fried to a crisp before the chicken meat are thrown in and fried together. It is then served with rice and a fried egg. So far, I have yet to find a similar dish that is tastier than Sky Luck's in Singapore. However, Sky Luck's takes a while to serve you the food as there are only two chefs in the kitchen so be expected to wait for a bit during lunch hour where the office crowd comes in. Other than that, Sky Luck's is definitely worth a try if you are around the area!"

The café exudes a relaxing vibe unlike the more ""gothic"" sister (Ronin) located just a short walk away.Punch is located exactly opposite Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Station and about 50 meters away from Dehesa (previously Communal). If you're coming alone or with one or two friends, getting a table is not that difficult but if you're in a group of six and above, it is better to book in advance. The kind folks will hold your table until 11am, before releasing to whoever comes first.  The past weekend, I organized a brunch meetup with fellow yelpers and had a good meal here. The 10 of us ordered almost everything in the menu including the 2 specials. My poached eggs with mashed avocado was pretty good with nicely poached eggs sitting on top 2 slices of sourdough with a side of burnt lemon for that ""earthy"" taste. The portion is perfect for one and just right when you washed down with a cuppa joe, in my case, I chose my favorite chai latte. While some suggest that the chai latte could be more ""milky"" and the spices be more pronounced, I like the way it is. With our ever warm Singapore weather, I like my chai to me on the ""lighter"" side and less milky. It's just a personal preference and it works for me. I took a small bite of my friend's earl grey pancakes with poached pear drenched in chocolate sauce and it was really good and addictive. Again, not too big of a portion for one. While I hope the team could come up with a more extensive brunch menu (currently only 7 items), that's not entirely a bad thing. That means the young budding chefs know their ability and only want to concentrate on a few items they do best rather than an ambitious menu while delivering a mediocre fare. If the usual waffles, porridge and eggs benny doesn't fancy you, then check with the friendly staff on the weekly specials. Staffs are friendly and our glass of water are always filled. While we try to milk a complimentary salted caramel brownie by singing birthday song to me, it was a birthday that I don't even know! And if you wonder, we failed in the attempt. The salted caramel brownie comes with a price tag of $5. If there's one thing that puts me off is the price that is perhaps, a tad higher than your usual cafe. But then, it's Singapore where you're expected to fork out extra at a slightly better establishment. I'm definitely coming back to check out their dinner one of these days.

If not for the fact that my friend is a frequent visitor, I won't have been able to find the place due to the lack of visible signage. We shared the coffee, poached eggs with avocado, poached eggs with salmon and earl grey pancakes amongst the two of us. Food was unexpectedly delicious! Being an avocado fan, I was more than pleased to see a generous serving of avocado on my sourdough toast. It was a pity the toast was too hard. The brioche that came with the salmon was perfect, thankfully, and felt very Japanese with the ikura. Servings were satisfying for the eggs but the pancakes were on the smaller side, which may not suffice for big eaters. It reminded me of McDonalds hotcakes in looks but more delectable. The coffee was decent but a little sour for my liking. I will definitely be back for the food."

Though note that half the space is set up almost as if catered for the lone customer who wants to get some reading and work done, which is great.I had the chai latte (I know, in a coffee establishment?!). Although they apparently brew it (not from some teabag), it was a lacklustre chai latte. :( A bit diluted, not rich, spicy and milky the way I like it. My friend and I also shared the earl grey pancakes, which was not bad, the roasted macademias and crumble on the side was a nice touch, but I wish the earl grey was a bit stronger. Pancake texture was so-so (erm yes, similar to Macdonald's hotcakes). I really wanted to like the place, but I think I'd stick with Ronin."

Although it looks incredibly crowded downstairs, the restaurant on the second level is chic and provides respite from the throngs below. You'll need reservations beforehand, as Dallas is a popular joint. Everything is all muted modern decor, and the menu leans towards American food, though its pretty obvious from the restaurant's name. Food is ok - good, not great, and not at all memorable. Price point is on the high side, and service is good. If you're having drinks downstairs, it's a different story. Beers are affordable, especially if you get a bucket. There's zero ambience, close to impossible to get service given the traffic, and it's all very pub like to perch yourself outside, exposed to the elements. I don't really get why people seem to enjoy this - you can hardly hold a proper conversation at all given the noise of the crowd. Maybe the draw is the buzzy vibe and endless touts?"

The area in the restaurant is very spacious even though it was pretty packed. Note that the food is priced on the high side, a set costs from $30++ to $40++ but you will not be disappointed by the portion. It is well served, sufficient to satisfy you. I would recommend the fish and chip, the fish was fresh and there was no fishy smell which most fish and chip would have. The meat is soft and juicy, it goes well with the tar tar sauce. Another dish I would recommend is the cod fish , it tastes freshly awesome and it would hurt to have the meal with a glass of wine if you are in the mood to indulge.A place with class, a place that offers you personal space."

This place has some pretty fresh seafood! I suppose they're known for their oysters, crab, and fish? We only managed to try the first two as the fresh fish was a bit too pricey for us at $90. Granted it was flown in from Japan that very day and is seasonal--ho hum..maybe next time.  I rather have a large crab for that price! The fresh oysters are a must! They arrived on beautiful decorated platter and were so large, juicy and fresh that my mouth continued to water after I finished my share! $25 for 6 oysters is a bit steep compared to Tanuki's $2 each, but is sufficient  for those special occasions and oyster craving moments. We also got the omakase sashimi platter for two and it was perfect! We each had six different pieces...and YUM! The cuts were nice and thick and because we were sitting right next to sashimi bar, we were able to pick and choose our slices. Other than Teppei, I've found a place that actually has FRESH tuna! I don't know why, but most of the tuna I've tried in Singapore have been disgusting compared to the ones in the States (I got to stop comparing!), but the tuna here is amazing. Seriously. The grilled crab we tried was alright, though I think it wasn't the freshest and tasted undercooked. Also, pass on the lamb chops. Decent, but there are better lamp chomps out there. Atmosphere is quite nice with both indoor and outdoor seating. The concept is an open kitchen and was nice a cool, a must when we're dealing with fresh fish. I would definitely recommend this place for a date night, though service was spotty. SUM: Come for the fresh sashimi and oysters!"

The tabouleh salad is very refreshing, although it's a bit too strong for my taste, containing lots of parsley; I prefer the North African version. The good news is you now can have wine with your meal, and can pay by MasterCard/Visa. Service could be more pro-active, as you have to ask for water refills quite often. Thus location used to experience high turnover (a super-thin-pizza place, then a Thai joint). Let's hope Pistachio stays long.

The food is just soso, not as fresh. The biggest eye-catching point is the the real fire oven. Pizza is ok in flavor, ingredients and combination is a bit unusual. I can see the intention to create a SEA + Italian fusion. Sorry, there needs to be more flavor sensitivity and depth to the culinary skills."

The place is packed, and all my foodie friends (amateurs, not pros) know about it. But then I meet professional food reviewers who have never heard of it. And virtually no expat has it on their sushi list. The low down is that this is excellent quality, with the same Tsukiji-flown fish used by all the other high end sushi places (Tuesdays and Fridays, by the way - book accordingly), at a quarter of the price. Gary-san not only has plenty of experience at the more famous names where he has learnt his craft (I discovered him at Hinoki), he is continuously seeking to improve in true shokunin style, and often adds a little bit of tasteful innovation such as his famous goose foie gras-ebi that tops the sashimi selection if you're going for the omakase. Apparently, he has gotten flak from Japanese customers due to his deviations from the classical way, but the Japanese people I have taken there love it... set your expectations accordingly?It's a low key shop in International Plaza, right at the back. Looks like any number of Japanese themed restaurant from the outside. Inside, a minimalist counter with perhaps 8 seats, and a few tables. Gary-san is part of the show, so the counter is a must, so you can enjoy seeing him slice urchins with giant knives or happily spread the wings of a flying fish under your nose. I think you need to go for the $150 omakase to get the full experience - the cooked food is also interesting. The service is spectacular and if I had to show someone what ""exceptional service"" means, I'd take him to Hakumai.I go there too often, despite the increasing difficulty in getting a counter seat at short notice due to his ever increasing popularity. The omakase keeps changing with the seasonality of the produce... One side effect has been that my Tokyo trips have featured considerably less sushi, as I just can't be bothered to deal with the effort that even half decent sushi chefs force upon the unsuspecting gaijin who just wants to have dinner at their place these days. Gary-san is easier, and just as good, if not occasionally better...One last thing: do chat with Gary-san about your expectations and tastes. He is just as capable of going full experimental and seasonal on you (think deep fried baby crabs served whole, mini squids almost still squirming...) but if the idea of chewing through 8 perfectly crispy legs in one bite disgusts you, ask for something more normal.Hakumai is my default port of call when guests are visiting Singapore and want to eat somewhere nice. It's the kind of place that ""you can't find anywhere else""."

Additionally, he has got a lot of bento sets which are affordable and of above average quality and quantity. Service is average - depending on whom you get, you can get a smiley girl or a stern looking auntie.  The Hakumai Bento is a mega set full of different types of dishes, best suited for the undecided. The Ishikari nabe was comforting and there was plenty of fish meat.  The truffle chawanmushi was gimmicky. There was nothing wrong with the chawanmushi, but the truffle sauce was nothing to die for.  On a public holiday, the whole Tanjong Pagar area was dead, but there was at least 3-4 groups of diners.

Jade,1 Fullerton Sq Singapore 049178 Singapore ,049178,1.28613061272938,103.853043454038,[],Cheryl N.,4WlVklOsSd409skDsWwQkQ,"Singapore, Singapore",4,7/2/2017,"I've never quite considered the food establishments at Fullerton Hotel to be worth checking out. I've had a weekend tea there once and that left me pretty much unimpressed. But that changed with the Jade Restaurant which recently underwent a gorgeous facelift in terms of aesthetics and culinary direction. Diners may now sample a menu that takes inspiration from the Tang Dynasty in an elegant Tiffany blue and white setting.First timers to Jade Restaurant have it easy when it comes to placing your orders. The restaurant has curated a menu highlighting Jade's 'Eight Signature Dishes' which includes must-try items like the Crispy Roasted Pork Belly, Deep-fried Prawn with Wasabi Mayonnaise and Sautéed Diced Beef Tenderloin. Other than the usual lunch and dinner offerings, Jade Restaurant also has an a la carte Weekend Dim Sum Buffet (which i'll tell you more about).I will willingly devour the Crispy Roasted Pork Belly ($14/pax or $29/portion) whole. Think lovely crunchy crackling and perfect ratio of buttery fats and firm savory meat that has been marinated with five-spice powder; the flavor is en pointe.  Love char siew? How about a Baked Lemongrass Char Siew Lamb Rib Loin ($23/pax). Trust me you wouldn't even know it's lamb unless you're super sensitive to this meat. Very tender meat on bone, with a caramelized sauce made with bruised lemongrass, sugar, rose wine, fermented bean sauce and dark soy sauce, this rib is finger-licking good.A highlight at Jade Restaurant is their soups! Their Soup of the day ($13/pax) is cooked for 3+ hours for that goodness to be infused into the broth. We had a sliced fish with tofu flower, konbu, and ham in a pork and chicken broth. Yes that tofu flower is manually knife-cut by chef and it floats gracefully in the broth.One of the Eight Treasures is the Sautéed Japanese Wagyu Beef Tenderloin with Crispy Garlic in Black Pepper Sauce ($23/pax, $47/portion). The melt-in-your-mouth beef cubes provides a buttery jus that balances the slight heat from the pepper. I also loved the crunch from the garlic and the fragrance it lent to each bite.A must order is the Simmered Egg Noodle with Boston Lobster and X.O. Chilli Sauce ($39/pax). This Hokkien-noodle inspired dish uses the same core ingredients of pork lard, cabbage and dark soy sauce in preparing the lobster and noodles. The star however, is the noodles! The Hong Kong imported noodles are first deep-fried, then simmered with prawn head oil, pork lard, garlic, light and dark soya sauce for the burst of umami. It's even better with the special X.O. sauce! The lobster is great, but the noodles are out of this world. I'd order them on their own!For desserts, i'm a huge fan of their Pistachio ""Muah Chee"" ($8/2pc). That light chewy muah chee is ethereal. Good quality green pistachio nuts are first roasted, blended till fine, before granulated sugar are added to make the fragrant filling. I found myself finishing at least half a bowl of the Almond Paste with Poached Egg White and guess what? I'm not even a fan of the Chinese almonds but i couldn't help myself with Jade's premium almond cream as the taste isn't overpowering. Jade also has a highly affordable Weekend Dimsum Buffet which only costs $39/pax. We sampled 2 items from the list during the tasting, which are the Steamed Osmanthus Char Siew Pau ($5.80/2pcs) and the Chilli Crab Mantou ($7.20/piece). The char siew bun was a highlight during the tasting- the pork is cooked with honey and osmanthus flower and that provided the bun with a light floral sweetness. However, when i sampled it at during the a la carte buffet, i failed to detect the floral hint and the bun was more dense and sticky.The Chilli Crab Mantou ($7.20/piece) is a great way to enjoy this local favorite dish fuss-free. The lightly crisped bun gives way to a tart-spicy sauce packed with silvers of crab meat. This item is limited to 1 per pax during the buffet. When you order it on its own, it is served with a refreshing palate cleanser of cold lemongrass tea with calamansi jelly. The good thing about Jade's dimsum is that for most dimsum items, you get to place your order by pieces! Say goodbye to paiseh pieces and hello to more tummy space for a variety of bites. Definitely have the har gow, siew mai, pork belly (it tasted as good as during the tasting), soups (limited to one order each and the Bird's nest and truffle in superior broth is yums), carrot cake, and mini egg tart. I'd skip the matcha custard bao (it was not flowy at all). The Kung Pow chicken was also off in terms of the seasoning.There are also other hot appetizers and mains to order from. The prawn balls in wasabi mayonnaise is one of the Eight Treasures and is also on the buffet menu. Definitely order this."

I am not referring to the popular seafood in plastic bags these days, but those old-school lobster fruit salad with spring rolls and fried prawn rolls (hei zhor) typically served as the first dish during Chinese wedding dinners.This July, Master Chef Leong Chee Yeng of the Fullerton's Jade Restaurant pays tribute to Singapore's 50th birthday by presenting his Nostalgic Feast Menu which features classic Cantonese delights from the 70s and 80s.  One of my favourite dishes that evening was the Crispy Yam with Kung Bao Chicken and Cashew Nuts. Infused with dried chilli, the sweet and smoky sauce coated the chicken chunks evenly, making this a welcome change to the typical stir-fry seafood and celery filling.In fact this nostalgic feast menu not only captivated taste buds but also satisfied our visual appetites as the talented chef transformed every single dish into a work of art.Just like the elegant swan that was carved out from the humble white radish, a magnificent Merlion stood tall and proud, overlooking the gigantic Pan Fried King Prawns in Special Sauce ($23 per 220g). Whether one was a fan of duck to begin with or not, this Chinese Eight Treasures Duck ($90 per duck) lured everyone with its wonderful fragrance when it was sliced apart to reveal eight mouth-watering fillings including salted egg yolk, roast pork belly, dry scallops and glutinous rice. The meat was moist and flavourful, thanks to a tedious overnight marinating process.The dessert platter is no less a mesmerizing work of art as Chef Leong showcased his beautiful lotus flower constructed from gelatin instead of sugar which is used by most of his western counterparts. Braised Bird's Nest with Almond Tofu, Pan-Fried Red Bean Cake, Chinese Sugar Egg Puff and Steamed Layered Cake with Salted Egg and Nuts (*available as platter in set dinner menus)Neatly piled beneath the plant are simple yet tasty creations like the Steamed Layered Cake with Salted Egg and Nuts ($10), as well as the deep-fried Chinese Sugar Egg Puff ($10). Made with only flour, sugar and eggs, this golden bomb has an airy, stretchy-like interior beneath a lightly sugared shell. A must try especially for those who have not tried this in their life before!"

They brought a tenderloin with vegetables dish.  They quickly replaced it with the correct dish.  The beef was very tender.   The peppers were fresh and crisp.  This was a delicious beef dish.tinyurl.com/8zpvh82Photo of the beef with vegetables that was mistakenly brought to our table:tinyurl.com/9ka7jokWhole Grouper - Now we come to the star of the show; the whole grouper.  For presentation, they brought it to the table whole.  They even held it for me to take a photo. Then they stepped off to the side and sliced the fish and served it in equal portions.  It had been expertly filleted.  I am not sure why I did not take a photo of the fish as it was finally served.  The fish was delicate.  It was flaky.  It was wonderful.tinyurl.com/9uxdozfRed Bean Pudding - The set ended with a dessert of red bean pudding.  I do not like red bean pudding.  Unlike the winter-melon soup, their pudding did not win me over.  I did enjoy the green tea ice cream though.  So, it wasn't a total loss.tinyurl.com/9uras6vOverall, this was a nice dining experience.  The food was very good.  The staff was very professional.  The evening just lacked some sizzle.  Even though I am giving it four stars, I doubt if I will return.  This is a dining experience that is more than likely going to be over $200 per person.  So, I expect it to be special in every way.  I just think it fell a little short of that."

It's located at the Fullerton Hotel and therefore the venue of choice for banks within a 100 feet. I'll admit I have often confused Jade for Jing, the other Chinese restaurant across the road at One Fullerton. In fact, there have been many occasions where I've found myself running back and forth through the Fullerton Hotel - One Fullerton underground pass panting because I confused Jing for Jade and Jade for Jing.I would describe Jade as a modern Cantonese restaurant, both in terms of cooking and the decor. So don't expect the usual red overload, bubbling fish tanks and private rooms with karaoke. The restaurant has a silver theme with white table cloths and some funky carpet design. On a recent lunch, I had the ""Nostalgic Classic"" lunch, which consisted of six courses. The meal started with an unusual classic - pecking duck skin on top of a little mountain of julienne apples and crunchy fruit dressed with a light salad cream. I liked the combination of savory and tart flavors with a variety of textures but more importantly, it wasn't the same old pecking duck in a wrapper with spring onions and cucumber. I also liked the soup of the day, what tasted like a double boiled chicken and melon soup. It was simple, refreshing and the stock had a good punch. Also, our dessert at the end of the meal was cream of mango with green lime jelly. My my, this was delicious and very cooling. I personally am not a fan of Chinese desserts having had one too many mango puddings growing up, but this mango dessert was chilled, light, slightly tart with the jelly and just a delight to eat.Other dishes that day included braised tofu, fish and aubergine, which I felt was tasty but not extraordinary. We also had a dong bo pork with mashed taro and a soggy mun tou. It's kind of a food lover's sin to serve soggy mun tou, like soggy nuggets and warm coke. Our noodle dish was a poor man's version of lobster noodle, with the lobster replaced by prawns. I thought the noodles were braised well and the shrimp was fresh, but it somehow didn't knock it out of the park for me.In all, I thought Jade was a decent place for lunch."

Small menu and portions on the petite side but the prices are noticeably less than others in the area.- Latte. Consistently well made and they do it better than another place I go to regularly (the Lokal), I think I had the woolloomooloo blend $5. Yes they do skinny or fat milk here. - Smoked salmon muffin, I didn't realise till it arrived that this was served on a homemade English muffin. Super yummy but I really need a bigger muffin to soak up that yoghurty sauce. $8- Sous vide egg is $3, add $2 for truffle oil and a piece of jamon with a tiny piece of toasted brioche. Again, the brioche needs to be upsized so do what I do and order their white bread for dipping ala kopitiam style. We loved the truffle version, truffle flavour was clear.- Toasted white bread - this is really good white bread and really toasted lightly with butter. They need to add some jam as a condiment for those who want it. $3 for 3 pieces- Tuna toastie $6 - same white bread, simple fillings but tasted quite fresh and not like how tuna can sometimes get a smell if opened too long.- fruitcake made by the owner's mom. He told me his mom is health conscious and he worried it wasn't sweet enough but for me this was perfect because it was light, fragranced delicately but clearly with spice and didn't have that greasy feel leaving your fingers all oily. Very moisty, I might have to go back to get a loaf. Loaf for $12 but you can get it per slice.I love the look of the place, the handpainted wall murals, little cubby hole window and the name Free the Robot.

(You'll have to excuse my use of Shinji as a benchmark for all high-end Edomae-style sushi in Singapore; with it being my first such experience, it will be the memory all new meals are compared to.)I'm pleased to say that while not quite as good as Shinji, it is a very, very close call. At this level, I feel that the freshness of the fish is a given. The cutting technique on display was excellent, the choice of fish mostly conservative. I would have loved to have had some kohada, but alas, none was offered. Once we set down, we saw Head Chef Keisuke Ohno start to assemble a start of what looked like tofu and uni. We hoped that it was for us, but at that point we honestly couldn't be sure. Once he was done, we were presented with a small 'cup' of sesame tofu topped with uni, covered in a light bonito-broth jelly, garnished with a dab of caviar and gold leaf. Oh my, what a starter it was. The bonito jelly was deliciously salty, a great foil to the rich sweetness of the uni and the distinctive sweet sesame taste. The caviar was a little lost in it all, but the salty-sweet combination was absolutely mouthwatering.We then moved on to some grilled kinmedai (golden-eyed snapper), served with a bit of salt and some wasabi. The fish was still very much raw, with the skin just lightly charred and very crisp. There was a lingering smokiness to the skin, and together with the textural contrast, was a great contrast that really elevated the meat of the fish. We also had some excellent chutoro, though the highlight of the sashimi selection was undoubtedly the kama toro or fatty tuna collar. If you've never tried kama toro before (and actually, I don't think I have) then when you first see it you'll be in for a treat. The marbling of the meat makes it look more like a cut of wagyu than tuna, and when you do bite into it you'll realise how absolutely melt-in-your-mouth the marbling makes it. After the sashimi we were then served a combination platter of abalone, octopus, and fruit tomato. Oh my. The abalone was delicious, but the octopus was an eye-opener. The texture was nothing like grilled octopus or raw octopus. Slow-cooked for four hours, the two slices from the arms were meaty, with a firm fish or well braised piece of pork. Flavourful and firm, it was nothing like what I expected as I bit into it. After that, it was on to the sushi. There was excellent sushi, though the rice wasn't quite as flavourful as some of the other top sushi places I've been to. The aji (horse mackerel) was delicious,  the otoro of course mouthwatering. The nodoguro (black throat sea perch) was particularly tasty, and overall the sushi would be for most, above reproach. I'd just like the rice to be a bit more seasoned.We were then treated to a slice of mizunasu, or raw Japanese eggplant. If you've never tried this before, let's just say that if you ever doubted that eggplant is a fruit, you wouldn't after trying this. Raw Japanese eggplant tastes like... apples. Refreshing. Sweet. A great palate cleanser before we moved onto our ikura and uni topped mini chirashi. Oh wow. Perhaps no more than three mouthfuls, this starch course of course signaled the meal coming to an end. The customary (in Singapore at least) dessert of Japanese fruits came after that, and it was a combination of melon, mango, and grapes. All three were delicious, and my friend that had never had imported Japanese fruits before was convinced that these were the best grapes she had ever eaten.This review was a bit more rambly that I'd have liked, but my affection is clear. A 9.5 to the 10 that Shinji represents, Chef Keisuke Ohno was very much a difference maker. Witty, affable, friendly, the conversation we had with him about other sushi restaurants, about his time in Singapore, and about how Otowa is better than Kazu (yes, I feel so validated) meant that I genuinely feel that I need to go back, just to let him know how much I appreciated his craft. You need to go appreciate his craft too. :)"

I tried a flawless looking chocolate eclair (S$7.50)  but was a bit disappointed when I bit into it. The custard was nice tasting, but the outside didn't taste fresh. Things took a downturn when I received my iced earl grey lavender latte, because it arrived with just plain 3 tea bags. Did I just pay S$6.80 for ICED TEA?!  I asked the lady who brought my tea to confirm this is my order, she came back to say this is correct. Last time I checked, a latte comes with milk (!!) should I have brought my own?!Also, do note that even if you purchase items for take away, you still get charged for the 10% cover charge. This place was named best French bakery in Singapore. I highly doubt it."

We showed up at 7:45 AM and there was already a queue. This tells you how good this place is.Taking a hint from the French patisseries, this establishment is quaint and comfortable, typical of its European model. The individual comes in, grabs a Danish or a breaded product with a cappuccino, and makes their way towards the beginning of a new day. I cannot say enough about how good the bread is in this place! The almond croissant stole the day, it's crispy, sweet base contrasted delightfully with it's flaky, soft body. I almost wish I had purchased two of them!The apple (my apologies that I did not get the full name of it) also had that sweet succulent flavor combined with the flaky bread crust. The ham and cheese croissant would have been stupendous except the ham selection left a lot to be desired.

I expected some sort of discount, as many bakeries do near closing time, but they did not have.After I settled on the Mille Feuille, the older woman behind the counter said it was $9.10. The display had said $8.50, so I asked her if she charged me the dine-in price. Instead of just answering me, she snarkily started explaining that here in SINGAPORE, they have to pay a ""thing"" called ""GST"" to their government and this money does not go to them. I said yes, I've been in Singapore for 4 months already and that wasn't my question; I want to know if you know mine is to-go. Then she said, ""you should know that already then.""Who talks like that to a customer overpaying for your pastry? Eventually, I figured it out and said, oh I see that GST isn't included in the price, although sometimes it already is. But speaking of the Mille Feuille, it was such a letdown. The cream had barely any flavor and the puff pastry layers were bland too, leaning on the salty side. The highlight of this dessert was literally the raspberries."

Yes, there were pickled ginger and succulent minced meat but the black vinegar dressing could not lift up the dish.Nonetheless, the sparkling chemistry between the subtly spiced chorizos and the sweet caramelized onion jam in the ""Flying Pig"" left me clamouring for more. Its miso dressing did not overpower the dish and I wouldn't even mind if the sausage was spammed with even more of the tasty onion relish on top. As a person with a soft spot for fish, I thought I would love the ""Jumping Fish"" the most but it turned out otherwise. A bite into this voluptuous croissant revealed an oasis of minced spinach and salmon filling. The smoked salmon was not too salty but the filling, which reminded me of the classic Greek Pie Spanakopita, needed a shake of herbs to bring it to life. Another calorie-worthy croissant is the ""Running Egg"" that was garnished with non-heady Japanese spicy flakes. While ramen egg gurus might insist that the ""molten"" egg yolk could be more gooey, I thought the current consistency worked well with the bonito flakes and mayonnaise sauce, which contributed to the tasty umami flavours.Prepared fresh in batches and kept warm in hotboxes to retain the temperature, all the croissants, except for the Ramen egg, are baked together with the ingredients. This results in a croissant dough that are more moist and chewy while the external layer retains a delightful crunch.Each croissant is retailing at $4.50 each or you can select any two flavours to go with the tangy salad with yuzu dressing, dried cranberry and mixed seeds for $12. My suggestion is to enjoy these savoury croissants at the outlets where they are served piping hot and fresh from the oven. It's alright if your stomach acknowledged the aroma of caramelized butter by making some embarrassing growls in public.Mine did but so did everyone."

It is a bit different than most other croissants as it is bigger, heavier and has a slightly more dense feel to it. The generous filling of almond does however make it really nice. Most of the other pasties I have tried have also been very good as well as some of the savory croissants as well. They do also sell 'regular' bread but actually never tried any of it but it does look nice.They serve pretty good coffee as well (from 40 hands) and the teas are also nice.

I had this infusion of butter in my blood kinda feeling after my breakfast. (if you know what I mean). The chocolate croissant has a really thin layer of chocolate in appearance, but the taste of chocolate was really strong! pretty delighted with that!Pandan, to me it's a very localized flavour, and I like the idea of it! It gave croissant a different punch in fragrance, worth a try!Kouign Aman was my companion's favourite, as it's salted caramel flavoured! (bread infused with salted butter and caramelized sugar!) Overall taste of the breads were really good!Had a latte and received a fantastic latte art. The sight of it makes me love the cup of latte I was holding on to.

Think of a light croissant - crispy, buttery layers topped with salt and caramel. More tasty than their plain croissant and not too sweet, which I liked. They also provided an assortment of fruity jams at the side (self-service). I picked a dark, pump colored one which I suspected was a mixture of fig and blueberries.  The Sandwich: KH had ""The Speciality Bun with Bacon"" and not being a big fan of bacon, I only took a small bite out of it. It consisted of bacon as its name suggests, onions, rocket salad and sun-dried tomatoes. The bacon strip was neither deep fried nor salty but still tasted good. A much healthier way of consuming bacon has been invented (hurray!). The bun was really soft and not heated. Personally, I prefer my carbs hot and crusty but this was ok too. The Beverage:The coffee was divine (probably the best part of my meal). I had a simple latte. Later, I learnt that the coffee was provided by Forty Hands (also part of the Food Collective owned by Spa Esprit Group.) Fun Fact: This is the same group behind the concept of House @Dempsey and Skinny Pizza, both of which I enjoy. Definitely looking forward to checking out their other food joints that I haven't tried, like Open Door Policy  and Forty Hands. Overall: 3.5/5 (but I can't seem to do a 0.5 on Yelp. oh wellz... 4 then :))Overall, I think it's a pretty decent place for an afternoon tea or a light snack if you are around the area (Tiong Bahru can be pretty far and there's not much to do around there except eat *again* at other places, which we almost did at Rachel's outrageous suggestion if our bellies weren't at the brink of exploding).Pictures of the cafe and its food can be found on my website, pandarcakes :)"

It was buttery and only slightly sweet, and so fluffy, I could taste a hint of salt (and a bit of heaven), life was good there and then.

Tiong Bahru Bakery is expensive. Whether you think it's worth it is of course, up to you, but I generally don't think it is.The sandwiches are good, but cost more than two plates of chicken rice at the market down the street... and isn't more filling. What's worth going for? The Kouign-amann. Buttery caramel-y goodness, this is absolutely delicious and the one thing I go back for again and again despite my verbal insistence that I actually boycott the place. After a few weeks of having it regularly though, I'm proud to say that I'm finally so-over it and managed to stay away for a good 3 months.That all came crashing to an end today after I popped in for a coffee. If you didn't know, TBB is owned by the same company that owns Forty Hands, meaning you know you're going to get a good cup of coffee here. It's a little pricey, for a 'small' cappuccino, meaning that coffee here is actually a touch more expensive that most places in the CBD. But it's good, robust coffee, and if you're already overpaying for bread and pastries, well you might as well overpay for drinks too right?Why is it still receiving 3 stars then? Why do I go back? Because it's across the street from my office, and it has the best coffee in the area. Because the quality of what it offers is undeniable, they do good shizz. But the prices. Oh the prices."

NahhhhThe salmon wasn't fresh, very unlike the salmon baguette I had at Broers Cafe (and their specialty isn't sandwiches!). And they could've been a bit more generous with the cream cheese. The pear tart was okay (with the so-so hand action). Could've been sweeter, given how the girl asked me ""would you like any sweets to go with your meal?"".

Found it very frustrating, and decided to do a takeaway of lemon zest tart and berry crumble. Both items were at $6 each, which was a little eh? as the tart is smaller than one's palm, and the crumble was easily twice the size of the tart. Tart was well.. not tart, which left me a little disappointed. It was actually rather sweet, given the candied lemon zest. Tart shell was firm to the bite, and made a mess when it shattered all over my desk. I quite liked the berry crumble - now that was tart and sweet all at once. The base was buttery, the crumbled top crunchy, and the whole item summery and yummy."

There is free flow of butter and jam and water on a separate counter which I loved. The croissant was still delicately crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside, it was good yes! But then how much better can the plain dough of croissant get? Not to dismiss the skill behind baking a really quality croissant but surely there's more to this bakery than the croissants!So I had the salmon sandwich which came with a cardamom bread. All the sandwiches have been pre-made so you can't really choose whether you want salmon with the squid ink bread or chicken with the cardamom bread, which is quite a bummer because I wanted to try the squid ink bread with the salmon. I didn't really enjoy the cardamom bread because the cardamom seeds kept getting stuck in my teeth.It was very crowded for a weekday and the queue was busy throughout!Final verdict: I dough not know if it will continue to reinvent itself or get too complacent with its current success but for now I'll just come for takeaways because it gets way too crowded."

Taste-wise, the baguette's near-perfect, down to the hard, flaky brown skin, and the moist, chewy 'flesh' that has the texture and bite comparable to the boulangerie in Rue Caulaincourt in Paris (loved it!). Price-wise, at 65 cm (the benchmark), the one in Singapore comes up to S$2.80, while a Parisian counterpart would be €0.80 (about S$1.50). A little too overpriced (especially the croissants!), but lending the Gontran Cherrier baking touch comes with a price (I guess). Will definitely be back for the basic breads, but will give the sandwiches, savoury items and coffee a miss as there's no way I'm paying S$8.00 for a sandwich the size of my palm."

From the outside you may easily walk past, disregarding it as one of them shophouses, especially with the chinese teal stamp on the wall outside. Yet on the inside it was as though past met present - its choice of furniture created a feel of a 70s bakery, yet it also had all the luxuries of a present day air-conditioned cafe. If anything, it can get pretty congested when fully seated, and so rather noisy - but I guess that just adds to the buzz and bustle of it all.I asked the lady at the counter (as I always do) for their recommendation, and was a little surprised when she pointed me to their simplest of plain croissants. It did seem quite pricey ($2.50), but I thought that if she'd dare to point me to something as plain as that, there must be something to it, so on I went to get that, and just that. It was such a treat! You could help yourself to as much butter and jam as you wanted from the side, and trust me you'll want more than one little dish of it. The prune/plum jam was such a good balance of sweet and a little sour and a tinge of bitter, which made my croissant taste like a good after meal sweetener. Then if you'd add the butter you feel like it could well be a pre-meal bite. Such versatile tastes based on the freshest, crisp and perfectly baked croissants you'll find in this country! I found it to be $2.50 well spent."

Spotted before: Zoe TayThe weekend that Tiong Bahru Bakery first opened, traffic snarled to a stop on Eng Hoon Street. Despite new outdoor seating, the best place to sit is indoors, close by the long display of breads and pastries, sandwiches, and baked desserts (in that order). If you're just ordering the fabulous 40 Hands coffee, skip the (usually long) queue and go straight to the counter, one for cash payments and the other for credit cards. Tiong Bahru neighbours swear by the kouign amann ($3.50), a salted caramel spiral-shaped 'croissant' which offers crisp layers and layers of buttery, sticky delight. There is no fruit filling (if you like those, Pullman Bakery does a decent version). There are three croissants - plain ($2.50), almond and chocolate. The texture of the plain croissant isn't the classic flaky sort; here it has many distinct layers - not a unanimous favourite. The almond paste version is much too sweet for me, while the chocolate has a really good quality to it. Baked desserts are rather pricey for the size, but seem to be popular. Try the palm-sized lemon tart ($6), which is sweet and zingy with a lovely short crust. Sandwiches are a good deal, with various ingredients such as bacon, avocado and tuna, each matched to a specific bread such as squid ink or sunflower seeds. (And makes for a cheaper lunch than at sister establishment 40 Hands on the other side of Tiong Bahru). From the recreated old skool look to the freshly baked and high quality goods, this place deserves all its kudos - but the slightly high price point keeps it from becoming a true daily hangout."

Another option for those in the east. I detoured there for my ""teatime"" before doing my second errand earlier today. Situated on the quieter side of the stretch of neighborhood shops. I like that it occupies  the 'L-shaped' corner, which gives it the advantage of views from one side facing the shops, and the other facing the open car park and the newly developed condominium. It has a modern industrial look. Naked bulbs with warm lighting hanging from the sides of the ceiling. These give it a cosy feeling. Petrol tanks are lined against some parts of wall and side panels. Wooden crates used as seats at one corner of the cafe. They have a small merchandise section. The young lady who took my order was friendly and helpful with my questions before I left. The one who served my order up seemed indifferent. It is not just the gasoline station theme that amused me, it seems that it is the whole concept for the cafe - an image of liquid drop (tear drop shaped) used as brand icon. Some interesting names as items offered on the menu: Full Tank, Fill Me Up and Refuel Pancakes. I had a cappuccino, which was quiet a strong brew for me. The Black & White Chocolate Tart... is something someone who badly needs to satisfy serious chocolate craving should have. Generous layer of dark chocolate ganache on top of a layer of white chocolate ganache on (chocolate cookie??) crumbs base. There is a choice of a scoop of chocolate or vanilla ice-cream. Mine will always be vanilla. I was pretty happy with the pitcher of ice cold lemon infused water provided. I will make mine latte for my next stop here :)"

This one is almost like eating steamboat fish soup for 1!Now back to the seafood soup! Prices aren't exactly that cheap but the ingredients they put in, does kind of offset the cost they sell at.I ""dapao'd"" (take away) the Premium seafood soup set which costs $10 bucks and included a good serving of Pomfret inside, 2 prawns and chuncks of minced pork. Another version also had crayfish!Prices seem to be from about $5 - 12bucks for coffeeshop fish soup, but for this quality plus its smack in the heartlands of Bedok, you can be sure that I'll be back!For those who already stay near by...

I made the mistake of going on a weekend to that particular location, and realised just how popular it was... actually that whole area is an amazing mélange of coffee/brunch/cocktail options.Since moving to the East Coast there were very few coffee options nearby my condo so it was a real pleasure to have 40 Hands move in for this java snob.I had a buddy over recently from Oz, and every morning we were looking for a cup of the dark stuff, and something to nibble on. 40 hands came to the rescue 3 days in a row with strong coffee and a delicious bacon 'n' egg brekkie roll which is an 'Strayan staple.I probably don't get here as often as I should, but it's definitely one of the first places to spring to mind for weekend coffee."

I was about the visit Nakorn Thai when my hubby did some research & told me Nangfa is the original restaurant. So! At 5:45pm, there was already a long queue snaking at the restaurant. Though it was crowded at the old namesake, there was no queue. The choice is obvious. I decided to doggy-bag. There are some food that are just not good for doggy-bag. Eg. steamed fish.Ordered their signature olive fried rice, their pandan chicken and Thai mango. I waited half an hour & got bitten by mosquitoes (please bring your mosquito patch along or pre-order in advance). They only take cash. Ryan took the order. He was efficient & fast.And I told myself  : "" This better be good!"" Enroute home, the aroma from the doggy bag nearly killed me.And a bite into each of the dishes, it was as good as its aroma. Not only was the food super authentic & yummy, it was super value. The prices competes with hawker centers! Would I come here again? Yes, with mosquito patch.

Honestly, this restaurant is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore and needs to be more famous.Ambience: 5/5 The whole restaurant is very quiet and peaceful and the decor is nice. If you like quite restaurants, this is a good choiceService: 5/5 The waiters were very polite and will try their best to give you the best service.Food: 6/5 ABSOLUTELY SUPERB. First, the calamari with prawns. It was fried to perfection but it was not greasy at all! Although if you were expecting it to be crispy, u will be disappointed as they just lightly fry it in batter. But still delicious and soft. Next, the bruschetta. The bread was so crispy and nice and the tomatoes on top were packed with flavour. A must have for everybody even if you do not like tomatoes. Next, the gnocchi. It was so soft and had a lot of flavor. The tomato sauce was also very balanced in flavor. The gnocchi was handmade so they put a lot of effort and heart into making this. Next, the ravioli. Unfortunately, I do not have a picture of it cos I ate it so fast. :) the ravioli was cooked perfectly and the filling was just so amazing. Once again, the pasta was handmade so a lot of effort and heart was put into this. Next, the lasagna. Again, the pasta was handmade so you know it would be superb. The pasta was cooked beautifully, not too hard or soft. The filling was flavorful too. Finally, the roasted chicken with salad and potatoes. Unfortunately, this was a bit of a let down. The chicken was a tad bit overcooked and dry. However, the salad and potatoes were delicious.And now, dessert! We had the lemon sorbet and chocolate profiteroles. The lemon sorbet was sour and delicious and the chocolate profiteroles were chocolatey and sweet. The lemon sorbet is actually serve in a lemon which is very interesting. Overall, I highly recommend Porta Porta. Its food, service and ambience makes it one of the if not the best Italian restaurant in Singapore"

There are quite a few new restaurants and stores nearby - so you can explore those stores after dinner.What I Love: The decor, ambiance, service and food is great. It's run by a lady whose husband is Italian - and the place has a very traditional look to it - pictures of family members, trinkets on the wall, it's a mish mash of stuff and it has a very homey feel to it. The food is pretty good! Their bread is freshly baked, and I've had their salad and Prawn Pasta, which is pretty yummyyy tooo. The menu does not give like huge options - but its pretty good. Must Try: Prawn Pasta. Have never tried anything like that before! Portions are huge.What I Don't Love: They don't open during lunch on weekends and they close at 9:30pm too.

Best time to come is around 6 where you still get an hour or so of sunset. Food we had were mostly good but not memorable. The Iberico pork chop was well marinated and grilled to perfection. The fatty parts do melt in the mouth. Serving is well for two if paired with some other food but on the fence if it's worth the price. Grilled veggie platter was alright. Can't really go wrong with grilled veggie. One winner was the grilled pork skewers. The minced pork was well marinated and when paired with their homemade spicy dip - I'd get more of these and replace the pork chop. Do note a few other things:1. Parking is expensive and limited - two hours was about 7++2. They'll take your card on tab or pay when food are delivered. 3. Try to book sunset hours so you don't get burn and can still see what you're eating - lights are a tad dim once the sun's out4. Kids friendly and water is free.

The airplanes are at an amazingly close distance, it is loud and big and just pure incredible. For me its a joy just to sit by the sea, enjoying the breeze and some seafood whilst watching airplanes take off one by one. Another plus point for me is that the live band generally play the oldies, 60s,70s, 80s, and some 90s. The food is not too bad, the prices are decently matched with its quality.

Add a spicy military stew during the snowy winters and it makes for a perfect recipe for homesickness.I think this is a franchise too so you can get it at other places in Singapore.

Next time here I get the full eel set. The meat was tender with a nice crispy covering from the grilling. It was covered with a good tasty sweet sauce. They show you the 4 ways (3 maybe) of eating your eel on TV. But the best for me was eating it with the rice and not with the broth.  Before I knew it I ran out of eel. The meal comes with soup and other stuff. Overall a very enjoyable meal.

I wanted a forth but staff said 3 is plenty. She's right. Seafood hor fun is good. Is it super good? Not quite. Got wok hei for sure but a tad salty for my taste. Vegetable is fresh but left as whole so a little more difficult to eat. There's fish, shrimp and squid. All tasted fresh. I would order this again and tell them to hold back some salt. Soft shell crabs was mediocre. Too salty again. Fried with a lot of batter because the crab was cut up into many small pieces. Cooked the Thai way with basil in the batter. Can give this a pass. Cai Po tofu is one of their specialty and it was too sweet. I think they used oyster sauce and used too much if it. The tofu itself was good. Not too excited about the Cai po. On my way out, I saw other patrons eating a tofu dish with white sauce (egg white) that looks more appealing. Their set menu looks good too. I would recommend the seafood hor fun and recommend that you try the set menu with a group. Adv Reservation recommended."

The sea cucumber, snap peas and mushrooms were out first, and I don't normally even have sea cucumber, but these were braised beautifully, and had that spongey-ness while maintaining some bite. The signature pork ribs were a great recommendation too - with a pork belly-like mix of fat and char, and were super fine-diney in presentation; something that I felt was a little over the top.Tofu and some fried duck pancake too?

Not sure why the menu changed, as you used to be able to order a basket of hash browns as a side. Not many other menu items for vegetarians, and pretty much none for vegans on the brunch menu, though there was no other menu offered on the Saturday morning of our visit. We went with a group of people, all of whom have kids, but were told that the ""homemade"" pancakes were out, but we could have the waffles. This was confusing, as the batter for both is pretty similar, and if you can make ""homemade"" waffles, then why not pancakes? I ordered the french toast, which was cold when it arrived (ice cold in some parts) and tasted like it had been defrosted. It certainly did not taste like it had ever been hot off the stove top.On the lunch/dinner menu, the options for vegetarians are pretty slim. We live in a condo on Bedok Reservoir Road, and every month or so we go to Wawawa to give it another go, but every time we leave disappointed, whether from the slow service, the music, the too-few menu choices, or the cold food (which could very well be the result of the slow service, who knows?)

First visited this coffee shop with my family last year (May 2016) upon my brother's recommendation. Already loved it a lot then as all dishes we ordered that night were simply great.For this year's Chinese New Year Reunion Dinner, we were thinking hard where to eat and I suggested to my family to eat at Qiang Lim again. I'm glad we did! 6 super delicious dishes (please see collage) cost only $98! Very reasonable by SG's standards especially when all were so yummy.The service here is friendly and prompt which is great. The entire coffee shop is sheltered, so, no fear of getting drenched if it rains. Although there is no air-conditioning, but we didn't feel warm at all due to the well-placed multiple fans in the coffeeshop.Ample parking lots are available at this quiet Bedok South estate - a great yay for drivers!

But once again, my beliefs have been turned around! I visited this outlet at Tampines 1 for the pretty well-known Korean barbeque buffet. I really liked the barbeque meat there! The marinated one is nice, so is the non-marinated one. There are several dipping sauces that you can choose from, and I think the meat goes best with the dark sauce with lemon in it (I don't know what exactly it is though... I just know it goes well with the meat!). But other than the barbeque meat, I think the rest aren't that fantastic. Like for instance the cooked food, the variety is quite limited and tastes very average. And although the barbeque is supposedly smoke-free, you'll still stink from the barbeque smell. Also, the floors are pretty oily and hence slippery. Honestly, I'm contemplating between a 3 or a 4-star rating, but in the end I decided on a 3, since I think there is a considerable room for improvement, like for instance making sure that the environment is more conducive and clean. Lastly, the weekend dinner is more expensive on weekends, so you may want to visit it on a weekday for better value."

My first visit was considerably better than the second. I had the Ala Carte buffet and the food was pretty okay. As always, I had serving after serving of sashimi (since it was free flow). Some of the sushi and cooked food like the agedashi tofu and tempura were quite nice too.On my second visit, I was kinda disappointed that the service and food quality didnt quite match up to my previous visit. I had ordered a toasted onigiri and to my horror, they were using thai rice. Flavourless, bland and burnt. If that was anything to do by, the rest of my dinner was about just as disappointing except the sashimi.Its going to take a bit of convincing for me to go back."

Priced at an affordable rate given the wide spread of Japanese cuisine, there's sashimi, agemono, yakimono, donburis and noodles. What makes me walk there uncontrollably even when I try hard to resist is the mentaiko spaghetti. It has the salty flavours of both mentaiko and bacon, with a touch of cream to coat the spaghetti together with julienned onion. Also, the ume soda though of a separate charge is something I have to order. Head down on a weekday, lunch is certainly cheaper if you have the time. The spread is not any smaller than dinner and it is also cheaper on weekdays! You will really have to go on an empty stomach to order away!"

The range of dishes available is astounding, from usual dishes like Japanese curry rice to separate dishes like salmon belly to fusion foods like mentaiko spaghetti. For the buffet, you order off a menu and the dishes are served to you in adorably tiny portions so that you can eat as much as you like of your favourite sushi, sashimi or basically anything you'd like. Due to the style of preparation, the food is served hot and fresh unlike in most buffets where the food is left out. I liked the yakiniku in particular, and others are worth trying like the yuzu salmon although it did not really taste of yuzu.At $23++ for lunch, it is really quite good value for money, and I have not been disappointed by the service standard yet."

I am such a big big fan of HK style wanton noodles that I can eat that every day whenever I was in Hong Kong in the past. #callmeawantonnoodleaddictidonotcarelolStarted coming to Canton Paradise about 2 years ago upon my hardcore foodie friend's suggestion. My 1st trip here with her was quite food-memorable - we had wanton noodles, a few plates of dim sum; our favourite being the mango prawn fritters which we ordered 2 plates in the same sitting. After that taste-buds-happy 1st trip to CP, I have been coming here about a few times a year to satisfy my cravings for wanton noodles. Thus, you can imagine how happy I was when my ex-colleagues suggested to visit Bedok Mall for our biennial get-together. I quickly seized upon the opportunity to suggest Canton Paradise as the meeting point.However, after reading another fellow yelper's tip of how great the congee is at CP (I have not tried their congee), I decided I will try congee instead of wanton noodles tonight. It was SO HARD to not order my usual wanton noodles, but, I managed to fight my impulse to order my favourite dish. I am so glad I did as the assorted congee (sliced fish, pork balls, beef slices) was really really good! It is quite hard to find good cantonese style congee in SG, so it is really awesome that I can find it here. Thanks L!The dim sum here is pretty awesome too. I will give them a 3.5-4 yelp stars. Wanton Noodles: 5 yelp stars. Service: 3 stars (they didn't clear our table after we have finished our main courses and we had to ask them to do it. Minus 1 star for this).My 4 ex-colleagues all tried the wanton noodles and loved it. Without a doubt, I would be ordering both congee and wanton noodles the next time I am here! So looking forward to it!"

The meat is generally nice and thick although there are a few points where you'll be clawing for what is fairly stringy meat. The portions are obviously more than enough. The side dishes were all average, save the noodles (thick with a brown gravy sauce and chicken - the name escapes me) which were excellent.

The first impression wasn't too impressive / unique; the raw egg was visibly seen and waiting to be stirred and the porridge seemed too thick. Anyhow, a good stir to cook up the egg also revealed generous and thick slices of fish. I noted the fish isn't the typical Yu sheng fish, which is the snakehead, but a more solid and expensive batang (Spanish mackerel) fish. Impression getting better. Finally, the taste test. I must say the porridge is well seasoned without additional soy sauce. Initially I thought it was bland, but after the second third mouthful, I admitted it was just nice. It was very smooth with no visible grains left. You either like this fact or not. I also liked that the amount of century egg was just right, not too much that it overpowers. The bowl of porridge just about satisfied me as I'm not super hungry. I can imagine if I was, it wouldn't be sufficient. But bedok hawker center has a lot of other yummy food  as well so yeah, order them together with porridge. You will have a great meal!ETA: tried the fish porridge over at the tampines round market branch. It wasn't as good as bedok one. Porridge was rougher, saltier and just 5 prices of fish - $4. No additional egg or century egg this time."

It retains its thickness and and incredible flavours even when you take it away. The stock they use is made from the real thing, not MSG flavoured cubes. They are very generous with their ingredients, which includes fresh meat and seafood, but none of the frozen foodstuff.My favourite is the century egg minced meat porridge. You can request for additional ingredients at a cost. I usually ask for a raw egg to cracked into my bowl. As I stir it into the piping hot porridge, it gives the porridge an added dimension to its flavour and texture.Expect long queues and a lack of seats during the peak hour times.

I'm so happy to finally try this place- I've been craving authentic, tasty, actually spicy Thai food after visiting Thailand last summer and being unable to find a single decent tom yam soup in New York. It's a doable but slightly Iong 10min walk from Bedok MRT, and accessible by bus (2-3 bus stops from the MRT). The interior is clean and bright and most importantly, cool and well ventilated in the weather! When I went around 1130am I was the first customer but by the time my friend arrived closer to 12 (lol), literally every single table was full. It probably gets more crowded around dinner time, so I intend to come here around 5-6pm to avoid that. Now to the food! Every single dish was amazing, and I wish we ordered more, but the portions are also so generous! ~tom yam soup (clear or thick or with coconut milk, with prawn or seafood or chicken, all $6): this was the STAR. I love clear fragrant tom yam soup and this hit the spot. It was spicy and potent enough from the chili padis too! It came with fresh spring onions and a generous portion of 4-5 large prawns, as well as mushrooms. (I wish I took a photo but I was too excited). This will be my go to spot for tom yam soup - and I'm a huge tom yam soup fan with high standards. I immediately da bao another portion for a snack/to share with family, and they all agreed it was as good as Thanying at Amara hotel, our previous fave indulgence for tom yam, and obviously much more expensive. ~pad Thai($6): also delicious. The noodles were the perfect texture. Everything was good. Seriously. The portion was also quite large and can be shared with other dishes. ~pandan chicken($5): this was fragrant and had the right spices! I'll probably order another appetizer next time though. The chicken was quite flaky and fatty, and the quality/consistency of the meat unfortunately took away from the dish. ~mango with sticky rice ($5): very fresh mangoes and satisfies cravings. I prefer the one at Jai Thai though, because the sticky rice is much softer. This one was different, reminded me of glutinous rice, was hard to cut with our forks. I'll try the Red Ruby that friends have been raving to me about next time! It came up to $11 each, and we left extremely satisfied. I'll be back!"

They say that if you are looking for authentic Thai food in Singapore, this is one of the better chains, if not the best. All the standard Thai favourites are here, at affordable prices. Their old outlet here in Bedok had a name change to Nahm Kitchen, and then subsequently to Nangfa Thai Kitchen. I hear a family feud was the cause of it. But finally, Nakhon decided to re-open a couple of doors away from their old location. I hear that the reason for the disagreement was because Nangfa wanted to cater more for Singaporean tastes, whereas Nakhon wanted to be as authentic as possible. Both outlets were equally crowded on a Monday night. With hot Thai music blasting in the background, the waitresses bantering at each other in Thai, the only thing that gives it away is the hordes of Singaporeans who descend upon this place in droves. Got to get here early, otherwise be prepared to wait. We had our standard order of Tom Yum Seafood Soup, Green Curry, and Kang Kong Thai Style. Quite happy to be eating our favourites again. Finished it off with a cool refreshing Red Ruby dessert to cool our tongues. Will try other specialties the next time."

This is served with vinegar and white pepper.We enjoyed steamed pomfret with pickled mustard greens and plum. The meat was tender and the broth was so sweet!The kailan or Chinese broccoli was not as young or tender as hoped but chef was generous with the teekpo or dried fried fish that made the dish savory and crunchy. The most unimpressive dish was the tofu with mushrooms. Great ingredients but less than stellar execution. Because the sauce was heavy with cornstarch, it was an off putting gooey. We wished that they would dress the tofu at the table.The chyepo fried kuayteow or rice noodles was pale in color but don't let how it looks deceive you.

A lot of the prawn balls was actually vegetables and we didn't find a lot of prawn inside, so perhaps you could give this a miss. The coffee pork ribs here was a standout for the tender flesh and nice flavor. We also had the fish maw soup, which was absolutely delicious and thick.

The set up was nothing much really. But the food is inexpensive and tasty. I always try lamb chop if it's not too pricey. Grilling lamb at home is not a good idea. For those that has tried it before knows what I'm talking about. Unless you really like cleaning your kitchen. The portions are quite reasonable and they have add on for a couple of dollars more, soup and drink. The dessert was $2+ and was a tiramisu cake that my friend's daughter really like.

It is actually a very straightforward menu that anyone could have made and I believe you can find similar menu of wet bakchor mee anywhere in every corner of Singapore. And how different and stand out you will find this stall is compared to others. This stall only serves 1 menu and 1 menu only: wet bakchor mee. First time is not dinner nor lunch time so it was only 10 minutes wait. Second visit was late dinner time at around 10 pm and we got to wait for 1 hour for our orders to come. And anytime, I would wait without complaints at all :) the texture of the noodles is perfect, with the right consistency and flavor that seeps into the noodles (I always appreciate flavorful noodles be it bakchor mee or ramen, that comes not from the soup or condiments but the noodles itself). The soup is very flavorful with its hints of fresh sauteed garlic. The minced pork is very very good since it is cooked in perfection, in boiled soup itself. The porkballs are a perfection with its tenderness and juiciness. Basically it is a bowl of heaven I am eating and I have not had any better bakchor mee than this in entire singapore (I am open for suggestions, but for now, this is the best, hands down). So if you have the time, you should eat here. If you don't have the time, come before or after rush hours and you will be delighted and come back."

Everyone else does it dry but this place has the power and authority to make it wet! It's the simple things that are the hardest to make, and honestly there are not many places that can compete with this kind of focus (only wet!) and quality. Let's start with the noodles. Noodle is springy yet not overly springy. There is a good bite-feel. Even if you do takeaways, don't worry that the noodle will become fat and soggy, the stall keeper will pack it separate with the soup. Thoughtful service. The soup is just so nice and you don't get tired of it. It's concocted in a traditional way of simply making good broth! It blends so well and so in-separately with the minced meat that were cooked with it. Meat balls are chewy and good, just tuck it in your mouth and I shouldn't have to review its meat balls to you!The last part is the chili. The part I never really cared about as I used to always eat it without the chili. But with just one time trying with the noodle, soup and chili, I feel in love with a brand new taste and a new world of this simple dish but yet so rare to find."

I have a slight preference (very slight really) for Seng Hiang's broth as it seems to be more fragrant due to the stronger garlic taste.

The noodles are different from the dry meepok version with pig's liver and minced meat. This is meat ball soup noodles at its most basic with only meat balls, minced meat and springy thin noodles. The minced meat is very different. It has a soft cottony texture that is slightly powdery. It simply disintegrates as you slurp it with your noodles. Definitely not the chewy minced pork at most stalls. The soup is a clear, savory pork broth which is simple but very comforting. There are several bak chor mee stalls at Bedok 85 Feng Shan Hawker centre but this is the one that you should be eating at. $2.50 for a small bowl which is alright if you have a small appetite or if you are ordering other dishes to share. A tip is to have this later at night when the soup has already absorbed the essence of the meat. Perfect supper dish."

A whole half avocado and the chicken was okay. The dressing was a little sweet but fine. Overall a good salad. Tip: They have an iPad booking system so you can put your name down ahead of timeTip 2: it's near Kovan mrt so taking that would be better than driving as parking seems limited"

Lola's Café has only been around for about 3 months, it surely added more liveliness to the area. This vintage café is also easily accessible - it takes you less than 5 minutes to walk from Kovan MRT (the exit opposite Heartland Mall).This café is set up by 2 young entrepreneurs, Choo Kiat and June. Besides being the boss, Choo Kiat is the chef cum barista. On the other hand, June is responsible for the pastries that you see in the café. By the way, 'Lola' is actually June's middle name.This small and quaint café is filled with a variety of vintage furniture and mood lightings. I was particularly attracted to their tables - they are all made from our traditional sewing machines! Furthermore, most of the vintage furniture here are for sale - Do check them out if you'll like to add a bit of character to your room! The most unique part of the cafe is their beer menu consists of a good variety of carefully drafted beers from boutique breweries in US, UK and Belgium. I went for their Matcha Latte which costs $5.00. The latte was pretty smooth and had a sweet aftertaste. It's a little sweeter over here compared to other cafes, you might want to ask for less sugar. I also tried their Banana Earl Grey Tart ($4.00) which is one of their specialties. It's topped with a layer of sugar and pistachio nuts which tastes very crunchy. The Earl Grey paste was a little too moist though.My favourite was their Wasabi White Chocolate Mousse ($7.00). Never would I have expected wasabi to go well with white chocolate! An exotic mix of ingredients, it's a surprising recipe and very delicious! Don't worry about the spiciness of the wasabi; it's very gentle and not too overwhelming. The sweetness of the white chocolate complements the overall taste and it melts in your mouth! It's so unique I can't describe it with words. You have to try it for yourself!Lola's cafe is very conducive for reading and for studying. You could also reward yourselves with some savoury desserts while working your brain cells! It's also a good place to hang out with your friends in the late evenings over some beer and honey wings. Service was great, staff were all very friendly. I will certainly come back again to try out their brunch and beers!P.S: This cafe is free of GST and Service Charge!"

I know we have Serangoon Gardens and all but that area is seriously too congested for my liking. Recently, the brothers and i checked out Lola's Cafe, a fairly new joint located at Simon Road, just a stone's throw away from our regular Punggol Nasi Lemak haunt (i don't like it btw). Lola's Cafe is a cheerful cafe with a limited seating capacity. I reckon it sits about 20 to 30 pax. And they are really popular. Go early, put your booking down on the iPad booking system and be prepared to wait.I've heard good things about the brunch menu (available from 10am - 3pm on weekends) but i've yet to try it. Friends that i've sent in Lola's way enjoyed the Avocado Eggs Benedict very much. All my favorite ingredients in 1 dish, you bet i'd order that next time.We met late for supper and picked from the bites section. The Truffle fries with grated Parmesan cheese ($12) was MEH. I'm a fan of soggy fries but this style is simply not compatible with truffle oil. The fries were bland and lacking in the truffle aroma.My favorite is the Honey and Paprika Crispy Wings ($9). You have to order this! This is an order from the Tummy Ministry. I loved the light crispy batter which stayed crunchy throughout the meal. The meat was nicely marinated and went perfectly with the light touch of honey which coats it.Their homemade desserts are apparently quite popular here but both desserts that we tried were less than satisfactory. The Dark Chocolate Sea Salt tart with Kahlua coffee cream ($5) sounded more delicious than it tasted. Filling to tart ration was off (too much tart) and the tart lacked in the butter department and was simply too crumbly (and i don't mean it in a good way). The tart tasted like one of those factory manufactured pastry shells. Meh. Sticky Honey Apple cake with French Vanilla ice cream ($7). According to the brothers, who aren't very picky with food,  Swensen's apple crumble tastes better and i concur. I had the Matcha green tea latte ($6) which was worse than Starbucks. It was terribly bland. Will never order this again.I was hoping that i would be head over heels in love with Lola's Cafe but i wasn't. Hopefully their brunch will change my opinion about them. Till then."

I have a weakness for nutella (eataly, won't you open here please?) and so my expectations were highest for this slice, and consequently most deflated. spreading a thick layer of the spread would have sufficed, really.in short, adequately decent and great as a neighborhood cafe - but it's not a destination worth too much effort in travel. although.. that salted chocolate tart might just about singlehandedly make a good enough point to visit."

The crabs are about $100 each, but they are large and fresh. Everything else is relatively cheap. I'd suggest getting a couple crabs, some noodles, a vegetable dish, fish soup and Roher the chicken or prawns. Or both! For beverages, it is popular to get coconut juice, served in the coconut. You can also get fresh lime or watermelon juice. I believe they have beer as well. You can choose from different sauces for your crabs. The most popular is probably chili crab. It's not really my favorite, as it kind of reminds me of spicy ketchup. But it's nice with some steamed mantou. I prefer the salted egg crab. It was a little greasy the last time we came here, but I like the  sweet saltiness of salted egg and it's a little less messy. Apparently, the crabs come from Sri Lanka. Idc, they taste delicious. The service here is good, too. It gets very crowded on the weekends, so try come on the weekdays or make reservations:)"

The sweet and starchy gravy was so pleasant and moreover with the enoki, they give the dish an extra bite.We all like healthier choices and for the greens we had stirred fried broccoli with garlic. Simple food like this is comfort food as the gravy tastes good with a bowl of plain rice.Garlic with Broccoli - $10.70 / $16.05 / $21.40Oh yeah! Oatmeal with prawns was definitely fragrant. Prawns were fresh and plump. Surprisingly, the fried oatmeal were pillowy soft. Prawn with Oatmeal - $20.33 / $40.66 / $55.64The entire chicken was very well deep fried and preserved. It was such tasty that I had a thought I'm attending someone's dinner as the service was good with servers dividing out into portions for the table of us.Feng Sha Chicken 风沙鸡 - $32.10Given the traditional place, Salted Egg Yolk crab is not in the menu, however they do serve the common ones like ketchup with chilli, black pepper, salt and pepper baked, deep fried butter and steamed crab. Crabs were all charged at $7.28 per 100g.Steamed CrabWe ordered the most original recipe and did not expect it to turn out so well! It was all impressive, at least to us with its most original flavour without additional sauces it was tasty in its juiciest and plump fresh. On top of that these crustaceans were placed on a bed of steamed egg which makes it presentable and unique in its style. Steam eggs were silky, light and refreshing. Believe me, I cant simply stop at one spoonful.Next will be crab again but served in the mixture of Tomato Ketchup and chilli sauce. The amount of spice was well balance out by the ketchup. Meat was as fresh and plump. However, more votes will still be given to the original steamed crab.Take these lovely Mantou for a dip inside the spicy chilli sauce and soak them up!When all yummy food fills our tummy, here comes the complimentary food from the restaurant. We have a platter of 2 melons, watermleon and honey dew melon. They were served chilled and tasted sweet.Being the first timer there, even though the environment may seems a little bit of chaotic initially, I would say that servers were all professionally trained. We are dining in big groups, occupying 2 tables and service was rather prompt without having our serving mixed up with others. As a whole, I like the place as it is good for gathering and family dinners. Even if you are there to celebrate your birthday, they are there to help you play the birthday song in the background for you!"

In fact I have been their loyal customer for more than 10 years now. Seldom really ever disappoint as far as the quality of the seafood is concern. The restaurant is so consistent in the freshness and taste of their seafood that I have literally ""stop"" going to other seafood restaurants. But of course, like most restaurants they don't provide the best of service when they are busy. But I can live with that as long as I get quality seafood..... Here are the reasons why they are top of my mind when come to seafood especially when you are after the crab dishes.1) The crabs were always fresh...... How many of you like crabs with meat that are soft and soggy?? Seriously, never once I have to make comment like the meat of the crabs were too soft. The crabs were always fresh, packed with meat and the meat are usually always firm, juicy and chewy. The only imperfection is that sometime the crabs were not packed with roe.... but of course it depends on the season too... so this is not a major issue.2) The best combination... crabs full of roe with sweet chili gravy. We will always order 2 crab dishes when we visit. Chili Female crab, and Black pepper Male crab. Female crab occasionally are packed with roe though they usually have lesser meat and smaller. Reason being the REAL STAR of this dish is the ""gravy"" and ""crab roe"" rather than the crab meat. The roe of the crab has a very unique aroma and coupled with the sweet mild chili gravy it just bring out the sweetness and favor of the crab. I personally like the sweet chili gravy though this is a personal preference. The gravy is not too spicy and it has more of a tomato taste rather than chili which is something that I prefer. The gravy is also very smooth and slightly sweet and has a tint of garlic flavor. Order fried mini buns and dip them into the gravy and you will be surprised how good a simple fried bun can taste.... So if you are there order the chili crab if possible a female one with roe and also fried mini buns to go with.... Ha ha a word of caution though... the crab roe has very high cholesterol content.... : (     but who cares... Next, Black pepper crab. We usually like to chill out with a couple of drinks. Black pepper crab with cold fresh beer is just plain heaven...... : ) Tried with red wine but still prefer to go with cold beer. This dish is kind of spicy though as it is packed with cracked black pepper corns. In my opinion they serve one of the most delicious black pepper crab in Sg (have tried some more popular one, but the crab meat sometime disappoint so imo they serve one of the best). We usually order this dish with a male crab because they are usually packed with meat especially their 2 gigantic pincers. The crab is covered with generous amount of cracked pepper corns and onion. You will be able to taste the sweetness, juice of the crab meat and the aroma of the cracked pepper corns with every single bite.... Down it with a gulp of cold fresh beer to complete the indulgence... it is pure pampering at its best... : )  We will usually finish the chili crab first then go for the black pepper crab with beer....3) They serve live seafood... so the freshness is usually pretty much consistent.4) Parking not a problem..... : ) Fortunately for a small restaurant like this one parking is not a problem because there is valet parking. Just pass the key to the valets and they will do the rest. Tip is usually $2-$5. Parking is free.5) Must try...Chili Crab (female) order fried bun to go withBlack pepper crab (male)Mee gorengSteam bamboo clams with chopped garlic (think only serve occasionally)King pork ribFried crispy baby squids (goes well with beer)Deep fried half/whole chicken (I kind of like it, but may be too salty for some)The rest are pretty normal.... but definitely worth a try"

Upon entering this traditional mansion, you'll immediately be greeted as ushered to your seats. You feel almost at home. No surprises here as this mansion has been here for the last 50 years! Lets get down to the food :Crispy sotong : Definitely my favourite. The crispy sotong was fried well and had none of that oily residue taste. Together with the dark sticky sauce, this dish definitely went well with rice.Sharks fin: the broth and stock was good but I felt the sharks fin had too firm a texture. Would rather spend the money on the cheaper fish maw.Hor fun - A tad too salty for my taste but the wok hei is really good and the generousgravy delicious. A very enjoyable fish.Chilli crab - very solid crab although I found the sauce lacking. However it has it's own charm with a good spices with a little sour twist.

The place gets packed on a Friday or Saturday night so make sure you have a reservation. Best to go with a large groups so you can try multiple kinds of crab.  Also, come early or reserve crabs as they have run out on busy nights.Hua Yu Wee is an old style old crab restaurant in an old house with a huge outdoor seating area in the back. Years back this restaurant was on the coast but thanks to the land added to Singapore over the years it is no longer on the coast. It is the last of the old restaurants still on Upper East Coast road.The food here is great and if you know what to get you can get a great meal for about 30% less than you'd pay at one of the name crab restaurants in East Coast Park or along the river. My wife and I much prefer the crab at Hua Yu Wee to that from Jumbo or No Signboard. We particularly like black pepper crab and it is wonderful at this place. As for the chilli crab it is also very good and not as sweet as at Jumbo, much tastier and better for soaking up the sauce with your buns. We've also had the salted egg crab which is good but very hot (thermally). They also have very good fried baby squid, drunken shrimp and excellent fried rice. Overall the Chinese food is very good and a great complement to the crab. You can bring your own wine, which is great and they will give you an ice bucket for cooling the white. Otherwise they have beer at decent prices for Singapore. Service is hit or miss, you will get served your food in a reasonable amount of time after you order but sometimes getting the check is a challenge."

I can't remember the number of times I've trooped down, ordered one chili crab upsized, one vegetable, and a plate of fried buns as a comforting dinner. HYW is an old colonial bungalow with a large open seating area out back. There's also a very large separate kitchen by the side. Kids love to crowd along the kitchen and gawk at the chefs in action from the windows, much to the latter's amusement. I usually like to sit al fresco during seafood dinners as the ambience is more kampong like. Also, the A/C inside tends to cool the seafood down too quickly, which detracts from the flavours. Sitting outside is better for conversations too, as the insides get too echoey and loud from the other tables.  I've come here for a couple of birthday dinners, and recall fondly the pumpkin soup we had. Thick, sweet and savory at the same time, it made a great start for the night. The chili crab is unbeatable. The sauce is thick but not overly spicy, and has chunky bits of egg and roe in it. Also, it doesn't turn runny after a while, unlike those in many other sub par seafood restaurants. Dunking fried man tous into the sauce and savoring the sweet, fluffy insides has to be one of life's greatest pleasures. I quite like the mee goreng too - it used to come with fries inside, though they seem to have gone missing off late :(Parking is a killer here, and there are many idiots who haphazardly leave their cars in strange spots to block one's way."

Started off with real consistency and quality, and despite the severely trimmed down menu that was introduced at the start of the year, I still returned for the pork and beef bowls, albeit less frequently.As with most newly successful small businesses, I began to see corners being cut and the quality of food gradually dropping. The final straw was the last 2 visits where my regular pork cheek bowls were made of mainly fatty bits of pork, with the fat barely rendered. Despite my feedback, I was given excuses that the pork cheeks were meant to contain mainly fat and therefore I was served a properly prepared dish. I might've accepted that but the fact that it didn't used to be like that for the good part of the year I ate there made me wonder if they've begun to trim less of the fat away to bulk up the smaller portions of meat.I returned at the promise of new dishes, which never appeared. I returned when I was given the occasional poorly prepared serving of beef or pork, usually on a busy weekend prepped by a part time chef. I returned even after having had a poorly rendered serving of pork that had to be re-fired. But I'm not going to return after facing a multitude of poor excuses that this is the way their supplier sends their pork orders, told that my idea of a leaner pork cheek was not right and owner Jeremy not even taking the time to see what was wrong with his regular's order despite having full view of my discussion with his cashier.Kinda sad that this promising youthful business let its success get to its head."

We reached the restaurant at 630pm without any reservation and lucky us, we were seated immediately. To be honest, the staff were pretty intimidating and rude. They work on a no-nonsense basis often ignoring us whenever we try to be friendly conversing with them. When asked what's good and highly recommended, they shove us with a photo album with all their signature dishes and ask us to make a decision. We ordered a few dishes EXCEPT the ""famous"" white pepper crab knowing we'll get ""slaughtered"" alive (overprice). The waitress was giving us an attitude while trying very hard to convince us to order. In the end, we won the battle. The restaurant is also very noisy - a typical tze-char restaurant where everyone talks at their highest pitch all at the same time. It's like you're eating in a warzone.  Now that I've got all the negatives out, let's talk about the positive. The food was downright delicious. We ordered: * San Lou mee hoon* Salted egg prawns* Garlic chili clams* Fried pork belly* Stir fry veggies with lotus roots* Stir fry bitter gourd with fish headEach dish was spot on in terms of flavor and execution. Even my boss, who is a fussy eater rave about the food. The signature mee hoon has a char layer and packed with so much ""wok hei"".  That shows the skill of an experienced chef. The salted egg prawns are delicious with bits and pieces of corn thrown in. I won't reveal much of the other dishes, you have to come and try it yourself. The biggest surprise was when we asked for the bill. The total came up to a total of SG$90+. That's pretty cheap considering we ordered 6 dishes to feed the 5 of us. It's no wonder the restaurant is pack to the brim by 730pm and hoards of people were queuing outside as we leave the restaurant. Given the rude service and how noisy it is, I would come back in a heartbeat. Good food triumphs, always. And it's no wonder even Michelin star chefs secretly make their way here!"

Reserve the number of mud crabs while you're at it. Arrive within 10 minutes of your reservation or lose the table.Brace yourself for the onslaught of noise in the dining room. The servers are patient as you think through your order.The white pepper mud crabs are a sophisticated twist of a Singapore favorite. The white pepper is more floral and less fiery. And the sauce they coat on the crabs is delectable. And, you have to get the wok hei beehoon (rice stick noodles) that comes in mats. The texture and flavor are really unique, and an ideal complement to the white pepper crab.The pork chop is crisp and fragrant.The salt egg prawn really rich. I was confused with the ice plant in thousand Island dressing. Not a bad tasting dish. Just not a good companion taste to all the other items on the table.The ice jelly is served with lime lemonade.

We arrived a bit early and walked around, but once they saw me queue up, they sat us down immediately.We ordered:- White pepper crab (7/10) - we ordered one crab. It's definitely worth trying at least once. The white pepper sauce is interesting, but it made me nervous that I couldn't figure out what was in it, maybe some sort of butter or fat. There was something in the sauce that threw me off.- Green beans w/lotus root (9/10) - love the flavors and textures of this dish, the lightly sweet oyster sauce (or something like it), and the crunch of the fried lotus. We ordered a small.- San lou bee hoon (10/10) - wok-fried noodles with seafood, meat, and some other things. This was the standout dish of the entire meal, even though we came for the crab. We ordered a medium and was able to finish it between the two of us. You must order this dish if you come here.- Salty egg shrimp (5/10) - we made the mistake of getting the medium. It's too much food. this was the only dish we didn't like and didn't finish. it's expensive too! Get a small, if you're in a group of two.Pro tip: Come early to avoid the crowds. 5:30 is a good time to come. Otherwise, I recommend having your hotel make a reservation for you. I attempted to make my own reservation, but the person who picked up the phone did not speak English, so I had the concierge at my hotel call to make a resie."

Doesn't look that special or grand, but sit here for 30 minutes and you'll witness 5 cabs coming here to drop off locals. We got the white pepper crab, the chili clams, and the San Lou Bee Hoon. The bee hoon was very nice (we got the medium size for two people). Has this simple savory flavor. Great dish to start getting you on your way to being full in the meal (so you don't have to break the bank on all the seafood items). The clams, omg wow. I normally don't like clams that much and I'm so glad we got the medium size vs the small size. You get so much more value, and we struggled to finish it because of the generous portion (or it's just not a 2 person portion lol). Everything about it was perfect. I got to the point, even when there were empty shells, I picked it up with my chopsticks, put it in my mouth, and sucked all the sauce and juices because it was that dam good. I only stopped because my mouth was burning since it gets a bit spicy. For a person that doesn't like clams to do that, I don't think I need to say anymore. The crab also was amazing. The pepper slowly builds up and combined with the spice from the clams, I was constantly reaching back for the bee hoon to drown out the spice. Still didn't match the first crab we had at Sin Huat Seafood, but was better than the New Ubin Seafood one. So #2 out of three really good crabs. I thought the price was extremely fair given the quality of the food and left feeling really full and happy about this place."

The crab meat tasted fresh and was flavorful.TIP:  When you make your table reservation, you need to reserve your crabs at the same time.  Otherwise, you might be disappointed.  (Thanks, Nik!)SALTED EGG PRAWN BALL:  If you like Chinese salted egg, then this dish will almost be heavenly for you!  Fresh prawns and corn were dipped in a salted egg batter and deep fried to perfection.  The rich salted egg yolk flavors added a bold dimension to natural taste of the fresh shrimps and turned this rather simple-looking dish into a most memorable yummy experience.FRIED GARLIC CHILI  LALA:  Lala are Southeast Asia clams.  Compared to the Pacific clams that we have here on the West Coast (and especially the Pacific Northwest), the lala were smaller, less meaty, but were packed with robust flavors and a distinct seafood ""sweetness"" that is rare outside of Asia.  They were fried with an abundance of red hot chili peppers which stimulated the palate and made the lalas super delicious.STEAMED PEARL GROUPER TAIL:  This was a giant fish and we ordered the tail portion which was already plenty of fish for us.  It was steamed Hong Kong style and was served with the most delicious soy sauced based juice which retained all the flavors and essence of the fish.  JB SAN LOU MEE HOON:  This might look like the least appetizing dish of the night, but let me assure you that if you are fortunate enough to grab a reservation at JB Ah Meng, then this dish is a must-order.  Mee hoon in American English is rice vermicelli, which you can easily find in most authentic Asian restaurants in Irvine or the SGV.  But I guarantee you that I've never had fried rice vermicelli this good outside of Asia. The most memorable part of this dish was the ""fragrance of the wok"" (or wok hei) that was so rich that the entire table was filled with a sweet aroma the moment this dish was served."

Dress casual and get ready to get a little messy if you plan to eat crab and clams. It is also noisy like a typical Chinese restaurant (tse cha).Thanks to Nik, we had a reservation. Most of the servers prefer speaking Chinese so it helps having someone who can speak Chinese. Their menus have good pictures do you could always point.Nik helped my Dad and I with food recommendations. Like most Chinese meals, it was served family style. We ordered White Pepper Crab, fried Mee Suah Noodles, Fermented Pork Chops, Stir Fried Chives and stir-fried La La Clams with garlic. Pepper Crab was juicy, succulent and not too spicy unlike the Black Pepper Crab. They gave us a female crab full of delicious roe and cholesterol. The fried noodles ""Mee Suah"" was flavorful and had a nice wok hei (char). The fermented pork chop was one of my favorite dishes. It was marinated in tau chiong (fermented bean paste), bread and deep fried. The chives and bean sprouts were fine, but unremarkable. The clams were terrific! I enjoyed sucking on the shells to get the last bits. Next time we come back, I would like to tried a salted egg dish. They are also known for that.

My family and I are very loyal customers, and there will always be a couple of dishes we'd order every time we're there.I really love their steamed fish. It comes to the table bubbling in a wonderful lemon, garlic and chilli padi gravy. It's so refreshing and the fish is so soft. Depending on which portion you take, it will take up at least a quarter of the table- that big! I strongly recommend diners to try it.  Their Fried Baby Squid is super crunchy, fried in Thai chili sauce. It's addictive and goes so great with rice. Stuffed Chicken thigh (or is it drumstick?) is so good- chicken and I don't know what else is stuffed in the drumstick (completely covered!) and fried. Each piece is so fat, juicy and oh-so-nice. Black Pepper Beef Hotplate is another winner; heaps of sliced beef slathered in a thick, punching black pepper sauce, all sizzling. The onions added the sweetness and was a welcome addition.Do save room in your stomach for desserts, especially the tapioca with coconut milk. It's rich, sweet and creamy, served warm.

What's good is the curry fish head,  Mongolian (style)  prawns. Service is not up to standard, but people still come in droves. The BKT is a little like the Malaysian style, but was disappointed that it lack ingredients, and only have pork ribs and garlic cloves. I must admit I do like the broth which is herbal. You can also order BBQ fish/ seafood, which is operated separately. We ordered stingray (it was huge)  and at $25, I think it's worth it. The meat is tender and the cooking style slightly different from the hawkers outside (a bit Assam style topped with ladies fingers). Overall it was enjoyable."

AND DID IT JUMP OUT OF A TIME WARP?This joint sits just off Tampines Road. No, it's not IN Tampines, it's a really old road that links Tampines/Pasir Ris to Hougang, and it has over 10 temples along it, and it cuts through this creepy forest-y/jungle-y area next to an air force runway. I used to have a take a bus through it to get to school at 6.30am, and it was misty, and creepy and kinda mysterious. Did I mention it was creepy?Anyhow, Mum said it was recommended to her by a taxi driver, who picked her up from the land of bak kut teh (or BKT) - Balestier Road. He said this ulu (read hard to find) spot had ""the best"" BKT, and was a favourite with his taxi driver friends.I guess we had to try it. Plus it was kinda near our house. Amazingly there was a day when the parents were home, and I'd freed up some time over lunch, so off we went.Thankfully, the road's only creepy in the dark, but at lunch, it seemed like a different world - it looked like we had gone to Malaysia... one that was 15 minutes from my house.But of course the moment they came to take our orders, they dispelled all the quiet-small-town-blast-from-the-past myths... the auntie took our orders on the new iPad. And she sent our orders to the kitchen via wifi. And the cash register was set up with an iPad too. Oh. My. Wow.After I reset my dropped jaw, we had some BKT, and also had a bunch of other sides, including Mei Cai Kou Rou, Hong Kong Kai Lan, and salted/pickled vegetables too. Now the BKT soup was a little herbal, and tasted a little Malaysian, if you know what I mean... and it was OH SO TASTY. As you dig in the $10 medium pot, you'll find it filled with pork ribs, and it's pretty good value for money! And the plump, soft cloves of garlic sitting in the soup? MEGA YUM.Now the other stuff was good too. the Mei Cai Kou Rou was braised wonderfully, and the meat was flaking apart, and the salted veg? Not overly salty, and had a little kick too, with the addition of some dried chillies. I know it sounds weird when you hear salted veg, and wonder if it can ever be too salty, but it can!It was nice to finish off the meal with some homemade barley as my eyes glazed over - as they are wont to do, after a good meal.Now one of the best parts? We paid $33 for the four of us. Not bad at all.I have to come back to try the other stuff, including the curry fishhead and the steamboat that I spied another table having. As long as I can find my way back here."

Someone in her review mentioned about their chicken being too dry- im not sure if she was being served beast meat or thigh but you are welcomed to inform the staff which part of the chicken you prefer. As for unfriendly staffs, as with all humans, during peak hours they can get busy trying to serve everyone but they are definitely not unfriendly.

Cool, silky tender chicken atop a mound of soy sauce and sesame oil drenched cucumbers. Hot, fragrant rice. Spicy, garlicky chili. A generous serve of steaming soup. There's nothing missing in this picture, really. Sure, it's as unglamorous as they come - sitting out next to a busy road with auntie waitresses squawking orders overhead, but the bustling ambience of being in the presence of famous food is unbeatable. Price wise, it's not cheap, but neither is it exorbitant. And if only visit sporadically, it's all the more worth it to splurge, both in terms of calories and clams."

And the oyster sauce was generous. It was a great lunch, except for one gripe. The lady kept taking away our chili / garlic and putting it on a different table. Yaaaa I mean we've taken some in our saucers, but then every time we wanted more, we'd have to call for service for her to take the tray back to our table, then she'd take it away again.

I was kind of craving for that particular cuisine, thus I decided to go all out and arrange my dinner in advance. Communication and arrangement of food was done via Whatsapp in a breeze. Here comes the rare dish which is also one of their recommended dishes, Sotong Masak Hitam, when translated from Malay Language, it literally means Sotong cooked in Squid Ink. The taste of the dish threw us a surprise with loads of slice onions, chilli added with hints of black pepper taste. We are not so much of black pepper lovers, however, the dish as a whole well cooked and the texture of the Sotong was right enough.Ayam Buah Keluak is not only on their recommended item on their food menu but also one of the staples that we will often order when it comes to Peranakan food as I simply cannot miss out the chance in having Buah Keluak Nut. This chicken dish in spicy gravy was served with 2 pieces of Buah Keluak and you have additional at $2 each. The chicken meat came in large chunks were flavourful and tasty especially when it comes to pairing the sauce with the rice.  However, it will be better if they are cut into smaller chunks. On a side note, the Buah Keluak paste has been already extracted out from the nut and tuck into our delivery boxes together with the dish.The recommended Braised Babi Chin is actually one of my favourite dishes ordered. The dish was pretty well executed with rich flavours from the mixture of Pork Belly with mushroom, eggs and potatoes. The taste gave me a good reminiscent of home cook food in which each and every item was tender and soft, well braised. I love having the gravy over my plate of rice.Base on the food portion given (excluding the rice), we find that the amount that we paid for was rather reasonable. The portion was big enough for 3 pax or perhaps good enough for 4-5 pax. Though the food we ordered might not be appealing in the colours, taste-wise it is still appealing.  There is always a saying that ""tabao"" food may not taste as good as having the food served up to us piping hot when dining in, it will be best to patronize Nyonya Taste by brew & bar again. When? I guess it when my stomach is calling for Nyonya Cuisine again."

Later, the original waitress who took our order in the beginning came back to argue with us, and tried to convince us that we did in fact order that bowl of pho. She even brought the bowl of pho back out as if it amounted to any sort of evidence. It didn't look like she wanted to leave without forcing us to take the bowl so we relented, having better things to do with our busy itinerary.We thought the worst of it was over but the whole time we were eating, we could hear them talking amongst themselves in Vietnamese right at the counter, arguing back and forth about that damn bowl of pho; whether to take it back, to leave it there, wondering if we were going to eat it or to charge us for it. (Of course we were going to pay for it). It sounded as if they were not at all concerned if we understood them or not but I'm pretty sure they know we can understand them because they took our damn order in Vietnamese. They wouldn't leave the matter alone and kept bickering about it and kept mentioning us in a rude manner. It ruined our appetite and greatly upset us to have this as our first interaction with the locals here in Singapore. Left a bad taste in our mouth, literally. I'd avoid this place at all costs if this is how they treat their customers, especially customers who even chose to foot the bill of the restaurant's mistakes."

Apart from the pho, the bun, both fresh and fried spring rolls (fried ones are better), we also tried the carrot cake (like a plainer version of our local white carrot cake), quails (4 tiny birds for $15 but tasty with some ice cold beers), cockles, gong gong, etc.On a breezy evening, it is nicer to sit outside where you get the evening breeze (plus some traffic smoke).

In fact, I never realised that ""mookata"" loosely translates to ""pork skillet"" in Thai (at least, this is what a light search on the interwebs tells me.)In a way, the mookata style kills two birds in one stone, as the grill is part BBQ, part steamboat. I'm more of a griller than a soup person, so I just stuck to the grilling part. Since the grill is dome-shaped, I found it a bit difficult to operate because my food would always slide down and end up in the soup! But this is truly a first world problem.We ordered a mix of beef, chicken, pork, and mushrooms (wrapped in bacon since it's a lot healthier that way.) I'm not sure how it was seasoned, but whatever they put in there made the meats taste pretty good. Add in the 3 dipping sauces (ranging from mild to Thai chilli hawt) and all was well with the world.We came here for a late lunch, so there weren't too many people there and the staff was very quick to come out with everything. I wouldn't mind coming back here and perfecting my Thai grilling skills, especially since I'll be living nearby now!"

Food-wise, it's nothing to write home to your momma about.

They do a fairly decent rendition of the dishes with similar quality to regular coffee shop zi char.The main thing about being here is dining outside with an ocean view. Great place to enjoy the sea breeze and watch the sun set, beer (and crab shell) in hand. Make reservations early to score a good seat that faces the sea. The name ""Belly View"" comes from the planes that take off from the Changi Airport runway and fly low overhead every few minutes.This restaurant is located within the NSRCC Sea Sports Center, on the left side of the boat ramp if you're facing the ocean.

Otherwise, you could try cycling here from Changi Village. Work for your food my friends! Dine out on the wooden deck which overlooks the sea. Listen to the crashing waves on the sea wall and watch the planes fly by every 2 mins or so (we timed them!). That's also why it's called Belly View. :) How we wished we were on a plane out. The food is simple but well executed Chinese food at hawker prices. You can trust the aunty for recommendations. I'd say order the fried rice, Mongolian venison or beef, Mongolian beancurd and the sambal kangkong. This serves 2-3 or more depending on the portion you order. If you are into sailing, Constant Winds operates Belly View so you can always check out the courses there. Make sure you make a reservation or aunty won't be pleased.

Visited this 7-month old Georges Beach Club for the first time tonight. Have passed by it many times but we decided to try it out tonight. They have indoor and outdoor seating. This evening was nice and really breezy at the beach, so we opted for al fresco seating.Giving it a 3-stars for the following reasons:1. Food quality - 3 stars: We had Ribs (quite good), Pasta Marinara (below par) and Seafood Platter (ok). Overall verdict of food is that it is probably of a-ok standards. I'll love to be proven wrong in future visits though. 2. Ambience-  4 stars: Very nice to sit outdoors in the evenings when there is breeze. Opt for the last table to the left: Here, you get to watch the sun set as well as get a good view of the beach. Very chillax environment.3. Service - 3.5 stars: Service was adequate and quite attentive.4. Live Band & Live Sports Telecast: Saw that they have live bands on Thurs to Sat. May drop by next time to take a look. They have a pool table indoors with Live Sports Telecast of EPL matches. This would be good for sports fans and pool enthusiasts. This outlet is linked to their more famous 7 year old outlet at Siglap. They have outlets at Pasir Ris and Punggol too. Their chillout atmosphere will make me drop by again in the near future."

It's a tiny setup located within a restaurant on Crane Street. Open in the mornings until early afternoon it's a mum and pop stall that makes only prata. A local spot in a quiet part of town. My favourite is the plain prata. I've had it with egg and onion which was good, and also with cheese which I'm pretty sure was Kraft cheese slices. Served alongside curry sauce for dipping, it's a sheer delight. Three prata and coffee with milk (ordered separately through the restaurant) this me back $4.00.

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore because of it's proximity to our lodging with family.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes but Mr and Mrs Moghan's Super Crispy Prata is well worth the wait.Prata is basically an unleavened bread that is expertly flipped near on like a pizza is and moulded until it has many thin layers of pastry, like a croissant. Prata is usually crispy and flaky on the outside, whilst remaining doughy on the inside. It makes a great breakfast, brunch or lunch but I can eat it any time of day and it is so incredibly more-ish. The Prata is always super crispy as promised in their name and the curry is always nice to dip the prata in, as is tradition. Although you can wait a little to find a seat, it's well worth it or you can always take away or Ta Pao in the local Singlish (Singapore/English) lingo.I'd also recommend that people look inside for seats too when seeking a seat as although it's a little warmer in the humidity of Singapore, quite often it's easier to sneak a seat and don't park illegally as you will most likely get a ticket.The little refreshments store serves up Iced Horlicks too which I can't help but get one every time we head there. I love the malty, milky goodness to kick off the day.Like anywhere in Singapore that serves at breakfast, I'd recommend getting there early as often places sell out."

I'm partial to Egg Prata ($1.40), and these were beautifully crispy, torched with a golden hue, while fluffy and chewy inside. What's most surprising, however, was how little ghee and oil was used; there was hardly a trace of oil left on the plate when I was done.The default curry accompanying pratas is the Dhal Cha, a thick, beany yellow lentil-based curry that the chilli-averse will likely take to. Should you prefer a more meaty or spicier curry, there's the fish or the mutton."

I can only wonder how small the others are. The only other outlet I've ever been to was the one at Scape; and I guess due to the outdoor location, I felt it was big.Anyhows, making the order can be quite confusing if it's your first time, since their menu is not exactly itemized. So each customer will usually spend some time at the counter, busying the serving staff with questions.This is also the first ever eatery I've dined in whereby they provide plastic hand-gloves for you to eat your food. The first time I did, my first remark was, ""What?! Are you kidding me?"" But it's only after you look around and start digging into your food that you will begin to appreciate them. Everybody is using them. Eating the chickens will be a one messy feat. Just be careful not to bite and chew the plastic instead.If you think you're up for the 'Freaking Hot' set, brace your tongue. It's gonna burn! Really burn. I've also tried the 'Snowing Cheese' set, but with the tenders version. Nice. Always been a cheese lover. However today, we got the classic hot chickens along with another set of 'Swicy' chickens. Sweet + Spicy = Swicy!Topped with roasted sesame seeds, with really lovely sauce... I loved them! And oh! You have to try the fries. If you love McDonald's Twister Fries, you'll like these too. Sure they're not curly, but taste almost the same; at least to my tastebuds."

These were not good options. The arrival of a new shopping mall and even more office space has seen a corresponding increase the availability of coffee, from the ever present franchise chains, to quirky and interesting places such as Table Manners and Knead to Eat. Espresso - there was a small volume of liquid with a light brown crema, so the beans were not stale. The size was consistent with a single shot, so it's unlikely to have been over or under extracted. The first impression was of woody elements with a little bit of bitterness, overall a nicely balanced shot. Not too bitter, with pleasant woody notes and all in all a decent effort.Cappuccino - the serving size is quite large, It's far too milky though, I couldn't taste any coffee. The execution was ok (microbubbles were there, the ratio of foam to milk was correct) but it's just too diluted. Shame to see a good underlying espresso buried under a tsunami of milk, and losing the interesting character that it had. Lattes on the other hand are well executed, and above all else, they're potent! There's a robust coffee flavour from the first sip. The milk has hardly reduced the coffee flavour, and this is a good thing - it's a bold and interesting coffee. The mouthfeel is fine - foam mixes with the milk nicely. Latte art is nicely done. Serving size is fine too - it's a good mixture of flavour and potency. Overall - good underlying espresso shots make for potent and well executed lattes, but skip the cappuccinos. Along with table manners, this is currently the best option for anyone in need of decent coffee in Changi Business Park."

And the staffs that were on the phone requested me to speak in Chinese instead. So I had to divert my language section of the brain to converse with them in regards to the reservation (minus a star).Came here around 5.45pm. Parking was pretty hard to find as the parking space was pretty full by the time we reached there. Tried Nam Tok Neua (beef salad), BBQ chicken wings, deep fried kang kong, seafood stir-fried tang hoon (only prawns though), spicy seabass lemon soup (that tasted like tom yum), dill pattie omelette, something like satay (sorry - wasn't the person in-charged ordering), and mango sticky rice. For beverage, tried lemongrass. (Btw, the one ordered was a Thai friend)The food was served pretty fast. The meat dishes were tender and flavorful (juicy). Was not too spicy besides the fish after adding more of the lemon soup inside the fish shaped claypot style. All the dishes had unique flavors but among all the dishes I mentioned above, i like the chicken wings. It was not too oily either and it leaves a lingering after taste. Lemongrass drink was pretty decent. I felt like they put too much ice on the drink that I tasted the melted ice more than the drink itself.This place can also accommodate big groups. As my church friends and I came here around Chinese New Year period, we saw people ordering Lo Hei and mixing the ingredients together with their family members.Overall, was pretty impressed with the price too. Didn't spend more than $300 for 15 people and we also ordered two sets of the dishes. If you are around the area, do try this place out :)"

The addictive, vibrant flavors immediately sparked an enthusiastic response across the table that borders on mania. The Fried Lad Na, thai style deep fried hor fun, paled in comparison as the stock was slightly diluted and lacked much aromatic character. Nonetheless, the chef's deft hand in seafood is also evident in the Basil Mussels ($15), submerged in a funky, umami-laden broth enhanced with aromatic cilantro and Thai Chilli. More delicate tongues can rest eat with the BBQ Pork Collar, slices of beautifully burnished meat with a distinctive caramelized aroma. The Chicken Wings $6 for 4pcs were slicked in a delectably sticky and sweet coating but the meat was too dry. Some of the cuisine here reminded me of comfort home-cooked dishes that go superbly with a bowl of rice. The Dill Pat Omelette ($8) is a well executed puffy ""chye poh neng"" that comes without the radish but a special legume called cha om (or English Cattle) that is grown in Thailand. For a unique twist, try the Water Fry egg, a pool of tasty and tender scrambled eggs studded with occasion chopped chillis, spring onions and served with Thai Style Crispy Sun dried fish ($12), which disguised sneakily as the brown conch-like decoration at the corner. Other tasty gear on offer includes the fish cakes and prawn cakes ($2 each) Looking like the tempura vegetables, the Deep Fried Kangkong ($10) would probably be a great snack to go with beer or simply with the special thai sauce--a nutty, mildly spiced concoction with mixed with minced pork. These were not too greasy but I prefer still prefer stir-fry vegetables because the greens were zapped of its original taste after a dip in the high-temperature oil.The real treat here is THE FISH. To ensure that the spicy, complex lemon broth stays piping hot till you even finish your desserts, the owner goes the extra mile to serve the Thai Walking Cat Fish ($28) on charcoal , an authentic way of maintaining the heat and quality. With fresh meat of melting texture, this dish kills two birds with one stone as one can skip the Tom Yam Soup and slurp down the hellaciously hot soup to the very last drop. Something a little more extravagant would be the Red Emperor Fish Snapper (seasonal price) that is steamed and sprinkled with garlic, chilli's and slices of lime. This second fish of the night is as much an achievement as the previous catfish, or perhaps even better as the flavours are sharp and seasoning is bang on. Other desserts include Thai Red Ruby ($3.50) Lemon Grass Jelly with Aloe Vera Cubes and Calamansi ($2.50)The desserts were those usual suspects that one would rattle off from a typical Thai menu but they were above pedestrian quality. My favourite was the Tapioca in Coconut Milk ($3.50) . These starchy roots were as soft as sweet potatoes and the warm temperature of coconut milk heightened the natural sweetness--a welcome change from the usual cold, stodgy version. The Sticky Glutinous Rice with Mango ($6) took me by surprise too, with the rice yielded a perfect texture.Given such an extensive menu of more than 50 items, I am really impressed that the chef can manage to maintain such a stellar quality across most of the dishes here. Though I did not manage to try my favourite Tom Yum Soup or Papaya Salad this time round, I was very satisfied with the robustness of the herbs and spices here. With a constantly changing menu and very reasonable prices, this is definitely another great place for Thai food"

Try Stephen's Hakka Yong Tau Fu located in Katong. I have been eating Yong Tau Fu created by this family for almost 40 years. Stephen apprenticed with his father, and now his daughter is apprenticing with Stephen. Getting Yong Tau Fu here is a family tradition and on our Favorite Foods in Singapore List.What makes this place so very special? Let's begin with the most amazing red sauce and chili sauce. The red sauce is my favorite since childhood since I couldn't eat spices when I was younger. Now, they are both delicious to me. It is rare that I rave about a condiment, but these sauces are pretty special.Next, the fish paste is fine, firm and flavorful. It pairs well with the delicious variety of bases: bitter gourd, eggplant, medium firm tofu, fried tofu, red and green chillies. They also have little fish balls. They also have my favorite white is a fish paste roll wrapped in tofu skin. Yong Tau Fu is usually fried, then cooked longer in a robust broth. Sometimes, I enjoy eating the wrapped fish paste just after it is fried. I remember hanging around the wok when I was young and eating these as a snack or appetizer.After it simmers in broth, the Yong Tau Fu is pretty good, too. I love the flavor of the slightly wilted cilantro cooked by the steam from the broth. I love mixing the red sauce in the broth for a delicious red soup. Hmmm. I wish I could get me some right now.If you are lucky, they have fish roe. Wow! Roe is amazing with the red sauce. Okay, if you get my drift, I love the red sauce so much that I can almost eat it with anything. Other specialties at Goldhill Restaurant are the steamed Pomfret, and the small stir fried clams. These 2 dishes do not carry-out well. However, the Yong Tau Fu develops beautifully when you take it home to enjoy in your own home. A toast to Stephen and his family who brought be back down through memory lane from the first bite to the last sip of broth mingled with that red sauce."

It was pretty crowded when we were there for lunch on a weekday, so we sat outside along the five-foot way, and sipped our Water Chestnut drink cooled with ice from a little bucket, kopitiam style.The main draw here is the awesome Hakka Yong Tau Foo, but the place is also famous for its seafood - the Yu Sheng (raw fish) was great - and this is coming from someone who doesn't like sashimi - and the La La (shellfish) was quite good as well. The quintessentially Hakka dish of Abacus Beads, Yam and Tapioca topped with dried shrimp was very respectable.If you've never had the chance to try Hakka cuisine, this is a great way to get a taste of the culture, but be warned that parking along Changi Road is not the easiest, especially on weekends!"

Prices are reasonable and the food has been slightly tweaked to suit local tastes, such as use of pork slices instead of pig's ear. For the more conservative Chinese, there are many aspects of Filipino cuisine that bear similarities to Chinese cuisine. Mee dang Hoon for example was very much like fried beehoon and fried danghoon, and their fried roast pork was simply heavenly. It was the last dish and we were already full and bursting when it arrived, and yet we had to put it into our mouths. I don't know how to spell most of the food we had since someone else ordered and I simply remembered it by sound, but they were mostly recommendations from the owner anyway. The spring rolls were also incredibly crispy, filled with mince meat and seeming like a more crispy version of Ngoh Hiang. Sisig is also another must-try, a hotplate meat dish with egg and lime. It's a pity we never got to try the desserts as we were simply stuffed, but the little fussy 8 year old has already loudly proclaimed that he wants to go back next Sunday so I might have another shot at ordering those desserts. Until then, we would have to coax our helper into attempting to recreate as closely as possible some of these amazing dishes."

In my opinion, even better than Gerry's Grill in Orchard or any of the Philippine stalls in Lucky Plaza. Strong words, I know, but hear me out. I judge the quality of a Filipino restaurant based on two dishes: Pork Sinigang and Chicken Adobo. Pork Sinigang is a tamarind based soup filled with pork. For locals, think of it as the Filipino version of Bak Kut Teh. As opposed to the peppery taste we all know and love, Sinigang is most known for its distinct sour taste. Kusina de Pinoy's Sinigang is particularly sour, which makes it downright Amazing! Yes, the more sour it is, the better (my personal opinion). I find the Sinigang served at other Philippine establishments lacks this sour umph.  The reasons for this are two-fold: (i) there is too much water in the dish and is thus diluted or (ii) the chef has scrimped on the sinigang mix. To top it off, the sinigang had a healthy serving of tomatoes, bok choy, onion, and daikon radish. My only wish was that there was a healthier serving of pork and/ or the the use of pork spare ribs! If you love Bak Kut Teh, you should definitely try this dish.  The Adobo Rice was also good. It's a must try if you love garlic rice. Personally, I thought there was too much garlic rice. Crazy to say, when Filipinos, love rice! Overall, I'm huge fan of Kusina de Pinoy. As a Filipino myself, I can attest to its quality and authenticity. This is my go to Filipino restaurant not only in Katong, but in all of Singapore."

The fresh mozzarella was delightful, and it went well with the briny kalamata olives, fresh tomatoes, and fresh basil.I ordered the pujena pljeskavica (don't ask me how to pronounce it) which is basically a spiced meat patty. This particular variation is the pimped out version of one of the other menu items (can't remember which one) as it's stuffed with cheese. YUMZ.I sampled the rosemary chicken, and I really liked it because the rosemary flavour was very strong. It also came with some good potato wedges.This place has been in Siglap for years, and the cosy decor really gives off a great neighbourhood vibe. We can't wait to return!"

She warned me that it will be more difficult to get here by bus/train and encouraged me to drive here instead. After deciding where to eat/snack and drink, and since I am driving, decided to suggest this place to my friends. When we came, I was surprised that it wasn't crowded as I had this sorta implanted logic ""bars = packed on weekends"" especially around 8. Was given the choice - outdoors/indoors or smoking/non-smoking. My friends and I were more mesmerized with the interior design so without much hesitations, we asked to be seated indoors. We were ushered to a small table with three chairs but one of my friends were eyeing on the couch for a larger crowd. We were also told to go up to the bar area to order our foods. Since my friends were taking awhile before making a firm decision, the server came to serve us instead.The first question she approached us ""Are you guys above 18?"" We literally laughed out loud especially when two of us ordered a Cider each and another friend ordered a 1/4 of red wine. But the server was smiley throughout the process of delivering our drinks and pizza. For the pizza, I ordered Pizza Bianca con Formaggi. It has two types of cheese -mozzarella and parmesan. It was a thin pizza and wasn't too thick on the flavor so it was a good choice especially with cider. Love the chewiness for the cheese itself and the crispiness of the pizza base.I ordered Kopparberg Strawberry & Lime Cider - 4.5% alcoholic content (the menu put it as 4.0%). I am always into fruity ciders or white wine and since I was driving, the cider sounds much better. It arrived with a cup of ice and bottle with left over cider on the side. It's more like drinking a soft drink rather than cider. I love it. I even tried the elderberry and lime one and I love both.Stayed there for about 2 hours but instead of people coming here, the customers left table by table and the three of us were the last one to leave. We managed to talk to one of the servers and she told us that she was about 18 years of age and was surprised when we told her that we are 7-9 years older than her. Anyways, she is a friendly waitress and even recommended the meat dishes on our next visit. Will definitely pop-by here soon. Parking wise, do Siglap center."

Essentials/toppings (3 choices for Little San and 5 for Megan San): Ebiko (Prawn Roe), Kani Stick (Crab Stick), Roasted Mushroom, Steamed Ebi (Prawn), Tamagoyaki (Japanese Omelette),  Tempura Enoki Mushroom -- These ingredients are all great.Sprinkles: Tempura Crunch -- if you want your sushi crunchy and Japanese tasting, choose this!House Sauces: This is the most important selection of the lot. One false move, and you won't like what you've ordered. I've been to this store twice now and the Chilli Crab has never failed me. Kind of gives the sushi that oh so Beautiful Singapore taste. Specials: Salmon Sashimi -- This afterall is a pseudo Sushi restaurant, so Sashimi Salmon all the way. You can come to Maki-San over and over again and you will never tire of it because of the huge selection of ingredients. It is a Sushi Place, but when it is all said and done, you'll never feel like you ate sushi, but rather a food concoction of your own imagination. The store is cute, albeit on the small side. The packaging is jaw-droppingly beautiful -- as a business person, I wonder what the margins on this business are with this huge fixed cost. I almost feel bad, leaving the box after my meal. In all, just a truly wonderful concept. If I had any constructive criticism, it's that the meal is not very filling (even with the Mega-San).  I guess that is a testament at how good this place is. Fortunately, its only SGD9.90 an order, so if your complaining like me, do your self a favor and just order another one. :-)"

I have another Japanese cafe to go to. I only knew about this cafe when I saw the check ins and reviews from a few Yelpers in my list and that caught my attention. Finally, my first visit of that place came and I was looking so forward to trying the sushi. I was not disappointed at all! The quality of the seaweed and rice is very good, and the best thing? I get to choose my own ingredients! There are more than 30 ingredients for you to choose from, even the famous Chinese ""Bwa Kwa"" (BBQ pork) is available. I picked a few of my choices and then the nice staff cut the whole row of sushi into smaller ones. The sushi is then presented into a very pretty box which I kept it as a momento. Took my first bite of it and I was in heaven (literally of course), it's pretty good as its fresh and has good favour among the ingredients. Combining them together, I got myself a good sushi roll. I will definitely return for more. The cafe isn't big so don't be surprised if the place is filled during peak hours but trust me it's worth it especially if you are a Sushi lover. :)"

The place looked quite old and we were seated right at the back where one barely felt the aircon. Menu was a simple 1 piece of sheet, similar to most zhi char places. We started with drinks such as Homemade Chin Chow 自制仙草水 ($2.00), Ice lemon Tea 自制柠檬荼 ($2.00), and Plum Juice. I had plum juice which was quite refreshing and cool me down after my long walk from the MRT station.Fish Maw Crab Meat Soup 鱼膘蟹肉羹 ($14/$20/$30) The soup was rich and thick with umami taste, filled with lots of ingredients. Penang Fried Kway Teow 槟城炒果条 ($5.50) The noodle was well fried with distinct flavours.Curry Fish Head 咖哩鱼头 ($20/$26/$34)The curry was rich and creamy without too spicy. The meat was firm and chunky. Ayam Buah Keluak 黑果鸡 ($13/$20/$26)The chicken was quite tender and gravy was rich without too spicy. However I felt that the taste of Buah Keluak inside the nut was not too distinct as it mashed into a paste with other ingredients, tasting more like fish cake.Chicken Prawn Paste 虾酱鸡 ($12/$15/$22) This dish was the hot favourite of the meal that we ordered a second serving. Best had it while it was still hot and juicy. One can taste the prawn paste quite distinct without too salty.Beef with Black Pepper Sauce 黑胡椒牛肉 ($12/$18/$24) The sliced beef was quite tender and melt in the mouth.Broccoli with Crab Meat 蟹肉西兰花 ($13/$18/$24) For one who did not really eat vegetables, I really like this dish. The broccoli was soft. Topped with the crab meat rich sauce, it kind of reminded me of creamed broccoli.Foo Young Omelette 芺蓉蛋 ($9/$13/$16) I like that there was a lot of different ingredients in the fried egg.We ended the meal with desserts such as Sago with Gula Melaka, Longan Tofu, and Cendol. The Sago with Gula Melaka was well made as it was not too sweet with the sago pudding soft and melt in the mouth. The cendol was the hot favourite. Besides not too sweet while been rich and creamy, the ice was shaved just right without been too rough and the green jelly strips retained its texture without turning frozen as was the case of most cendol stalls faced when using factory made jelly strips.Although I felt at the beginning of the meal, it was quite cold for me at the end of the meal. Surprisely the restaurant was packed for a weekday nite."

Btw locating it can be quite confusing as ""180 Bedok reservoir road"" is nestled among the 600s hdb blocks - it's actually just at Eunos community club! On top of my usual butter chicken and naan combo I tried chicken Mughlai, which is chicken cooked in a cashew paste and it was amazing - fragrant tangy nutty taste that's a little spicy and not too cloyingly sweet like how butter chicken can sometimes get (not sure about the one from here though have to come back another time). The chicken also had the distinct flavour of Taandori roast. I also tried Taandori parota which seems like a Taandori grilled version of Prata but slightly thicker - interesting but I have to say naan always goes best with the chicken dishes haha. Atmosphere is great with air con, clean environment and pretty quiet (on a weekday night). The menu was filled with many dishes I've never tried and I had to Google so many of them to get an idea of what was it exactly. Feels like traveling in my own country and I definitely need to be more adventurous in Indian food - Velus has definitely given me incentive for that !"

This sucker was super spicy and so I experienced crying eyes and a runny nose due to the chillies, and the server took pity on me and switched out my curry (I had unknowingly chosen the more spicy options). My pomfret was a little bit overcooked and dry + too oily, which sorta sucked, cause its a small fish to begin with. But the food was plentiful and everything else was really tasty and heart-warming. I also got Tea Tarik, which was awesome and also helped cool down my spice levels. I also tried two other meals that my colleagues got - the Dal Tadka was nice, but didn't like the Chicken tikka masala that much.

There's a bit of an unspoken tradition within our family in Singapore, in that everyone will always try to shout the other person's meal. With Dad being one of 14 children to his parents, there is certainly a rush to pay the bill, when it gets near the end of the meal and at times, there can be a bit of jostling between cousins, uncles and aunties to take care of the payment. Sometime I even go to the extreme where I'll pretend to go to the restrooms and sneakily pay before anyone else has had the chance.As it turns out my uncle insisted that he pay and we got great value for money with the Fish Head Curry, Butter Chicken, Rogan Josh, Garlic Naan and a Mutton Biryani.I really enjoyed it all with a special mention to the Rogan Josh and Garlic Naan which was crispy but doughy and garlicky.Fish Head Curry can tend to be sour, which my girlfriend doesn't like but I quite like it and it's better served with rice but I prefer naan."

It is also where you can get local style coffee and tea. Both teh (tea) and kopi (coffee) are good, strong and sweet, which is how I like my beverage to be. Food wise, it is very average. The nasi lemak comes with a sad looking piece of fried chicken, so unlike the version at Marina Bay Sands Shoppes. It is really something to be ordered only if you are desperately hungry or if you just want nasi lemak when inside the terminal. The soft boiled eggs and kaya toast are a better option though the toast gets cold very quickly.Mee siam and mee rebus are also not to die for. I guess that leaves the local coffee and tea the safest bet for ordering. Then again, Starbucks is just next to it, so you could always get your caffeine fix there too."

The food is good, prices are even better and it's family owned and has such a nice small cafe ambiance - I truly, truly, truly love this place! And I'll explain why....What I Love: The menu is comprehensive, and in Singapore, it's really hard to get authentic and good Thai food. You really can't consider Thai Express Thai Food, so there's really a lack of good Thai food in Singapore. The Basil Inn's food is authentic as the chefs are Thai, the portions are great, and they'll tweak it to your preference - if you want more or less chili. Have to try their Som Tum, Pat Thai, and their Mango Salad. They have food from the North too - and their claypots, Tom Yum & Tom Kha Gai are pretty great too. I usually have their Thai Iced Tea, Thai Coconut and Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. Prices are really affordable - and every thing's about $5-$8ish. What I also love is that it's a family owned business - so everyone chips in, and it's nice to have such establishments in Singapore - as opposed to all the commercial stuff we see around all the time.What I Don't Love: Absolutely nothing!! ;D"

With the exception of a few places such as The Basil Inn that serves authentic Thai food at affordable prices.  The portions are however tiny, so do order more than you usually would - the up side however is that you get to order a greater variety of food to try.The Tom Yum soup here is incredibly spicy and sour - I usually only survive around 2 or 3 spoons of the soup since I can't take very spicy, but it is sooo tasty you have to try it!  The phad thai is also superb - fried to perfection and a little dry, it really reminded me of the phad thai I had on the streets in bangkok. Another great dish is the stir fried pork mince and beans - so fragrant, but beware it also packs a spicy punch!  The servers will be able to recommend you the dishes that aren't so spicy, so do ask for their recommendations!"

Only this time, it was a cleaner china with better ingredients.If you have ever lived in China you would know that Chinese food has a distinct flavour, or perhaps character, that distinguishes it from duplication outside of the motherland. Perhaps, if you lived in central China its the recycled and refined chilli oil, or, if you lived in Guangdong, it could be the muddy taste of farmed fish, the the heavy aromas of China's baking powder, or perhaps even the omnipresence of MSG (though even in Singapore that is everywhere).At 來姐家 the tastes felt authentic even without all the things we'd expect being in it. However, it has to be noted that the service was very much unlike that in China. A guy who I assume is a boss type character made sure I was happy with what I was eating, a beer lady kept my glass filled and I was even given peanuts to accompany my beer!Anyway, when my friends from overseas visit me, this will definitely be a part of the itinerary."

Of course, *I* wouldn't have a trashy food craving. Me? In all my aircon loving, atas restaurant only glory? No way. Cue sideways glance. Ahem. Ok I confess. I'm an aircon loving kampong girl at heart. And Spize does a mean Thai style maggi goreng that I find spicy, sour, and super addictive. I don't even know why I like it that much; it's not that great, but I think fried carbs at midnight must be the ultimate comfort food. The gado gado too. Thick peanutty sauce, dense rice cake, spuds and bite sized pieces of keropok. It doesn't get anything better than this. I always see patrons drinking bandung or this blue colored drink that frankly scares me a little. If you've a sweet tooth, go for the Horlicks dinosaur. If you thought the Milo dinosaur was sweet, boy are you in for a real kick in the pants. It's thick and incredibly potent and by the time you're halfway through, you'll need a bottle of water to dilute all that sugar in your blood stream. You heard it here first!"

A personal favourite is Tofu Tiga Rasa, which literally means in malay, Three Flavour Tofu. It's not completely honest, however; you'll taste at least 8 flavours and then some.

The prawn paste-accented wings were nice, but vapid, and so, failed to leave an impression. I've had better for less.4) Smoky Black Pepper Duck Breast ($18.90): surprising refined. I wouldn't have expected a casual place like this to serve this typically highbrow dish, or to do it this well. Sparkling fresh meat, with nary a hint of game, was slow-roasted to luscious perfection. This was sided by wafu-dressed mesclun greens, and mashed potatoes.5) Fish & Chips ($18.90): decent, but the deep-fried Pacific dory fillet was a dime a dozen.6) Grilled Guinness Balsamic Chicken ($19.90) marinated in Cajun herbs, sided by steamed root vegetables, mashed potatoes, and slathered in a Guinness beer gravy: nice enough, but it reminded me of those hawker centre western food stall productions.7) Chicago Roasted Tenderloin ($29.90): even though cheap, this was lackluster.

The music is pure quality, and the service too is excellent. It is one of the few places in Singapore where you will find parking right outside. What I like about the parking is the lack of system, this allows you to maximize the empty spaces on the grass, along the side and so on. It is a decent distance away from any other night life joint so it does give that feeling of isolation. The food isn't bad too, the speciality for me being the Chilean Cod Fusion, I've had this 3 times before and never once has it disappointed me!The restaurant is decked out in magnificent lights, and the sitting arrangement is positioned very comfortably, allowing ample space between tables. For me, this is a great place to find a temporary escape from the city life, almost makes me feel like I am on holiday!"

The whole place is designed in a deliberately spartan way, though it would not look out of place if it was in the CBD.The choice of food is not great and given the slow business, they have not stocked up on quite a few mains and starters. However, the bacon lollipop, which is one of their specialties, was available. It is 5 layers of fatty bacon glistening with oily goodness. Pure decadence.For mains, we had the truffle carbonara and the tiger prawns pasta. Both were quite decent and I noted that actual truffles were used, rather than just truffle oil which scored points with me. However, the tiger prawns pasta took a long time to arrive (30 minutes after the truffle carbonara) and we had to remind the waitress about the order. We also tried the coffee, which was distinctly average. That seemed understandable though, given that it is more of a bar than a cafe.Probably a good place to hang out with your buddies in the heartlands if you want drinks and a decent meal."

The potstickers were nearly perfect. They were crispy, hot, tender, juicy explosions of flavor. The mincemeat noodles were surprisingly light in contrast, but great noodle texture and flavor, tasty sauce, and fresh cucumbers. The steamed buns and stir-fried veggies were notable, too, but my favorite dish was the eggplant. If you like eggplant you must try it! Great service. Pleasant, casual atmosphere.

The xiao long bao dumplings had a thicker skin than I prefer but the filling was pork'ilicious. It came 4 to an order.

The posters of other celeb visitors such as Gordon Ramsay, Martin Yen & Samantha Brown are still there just as I remembered. Got the standard laksa again, the broth was still excellent as I remembered: rich, creamy, smooth & spicy.  But it only contained basic ingredients such as some bean sprouts & a few cockles, no other seafood (e.g. shrimps) unless you pay extra. Standard katong style short rice noodles that can be eaten with a spoon, no chopsticks needed.The $2 nasi lemak wrapped in leaf: very forgetable, rice was dry & not much flavor even with their samba sauce. It also contained a sorry-looking piece of small dry fish.Overall the broth of their laksa is still one of the best I have ever had. I just don't like the fact that they took advantage of their fame & skimped on other ingredients. I ate at multiple good laksa places, including its equally famed competitor across the street as well as the trishaw laksa in Hon Lim center, they both had descend amount of ""seafood"" in their standard basic laksa."

What's interesting is they don't provide chopsticks. You're expected to slurp down your laksa with no other utensil other than your spoon.Not sure if this made everything taste better, but this bowl was the best tasting laksa I've had - even after trying several laksa joints in previous days.

It was a little bland for me, so make sure to add a packet of the sauce that comes with the bowl of noodles (from what I remember it comes with 2 packets, but charge per packet after that). It definitely adds more flavor to the broth. I have to warn those that cannot take the heat because it is SPICY. Also, expect to eat this with a soup spoon, no chopsticks/fork. The otah, a type of fish cake, was real good, especially if you add some of that sauce that came with your laksa.After pondering long and hard, the laksa was actually really good and is one of the better bowls I've had in Singapore, but I don't think I would take a 20-30 min bus ride all the way out here to satisfy my laksa craving."

I certainly didn't expect to enjoy it nearly this much, and the just-on-the-edge sour of the lime juice was pretty perfect.the small coffeeshop space is fully air-conditioned, which is fantastic considering the heat and spiciness of the dish, but that luxury does reflect itself in its price. little matter though, as it honestly is more filling than whatever you'd receive at a newfangled cafe for the money, and is likely executed with more skill and finesse anyway.worth a visit, and definitely worth the money."

Enjoying the hot bowl of Laska with a cold drink of Barley is definitely satisfying for me. I often choose the $5 bowl which is enough to satisfying my hunger. The noodles in the Laska is sliced to small pieces which means a pair of chopsticks is not required and you can just enjoy with a spoon. It's has a strong flavour and every spoonful of it makes me want more, that's how I felt especially on my last trip there.

Its not a full on 5-stars because I have had better laksa, but the ""Otah"" gets a full 5-stars. I have never had it before and its basically fish in a banana leaf, but omg the flavors!!

The shop itself is rather small, but could house up to 20-30 guests. My husband order the 3 small bowls of the laksa. He also ordered lime juice for himself and luohan longan for me. My mother-in-law was also with us, but she prefered something warm, but the shop does not offer anything warm so she did not want a drink. The order comes right out once he places his order and he brought all the laksa and drinks on a tray to our table. The laksa only comes with a spoon, there's no forks or chopsticks at this shop. I wanted a pair of chopsticks or fork because my noodles were quite long and each time I scoop up the noodles and toppings, all of the noodles would slide right off and only the toppings were left. Eventually I managed to look for the shorter noodles in my bowl and enjoyed those first. Which was pretty good, because there were slices of squid/cuttlefish. There were also small clam-like things in the laksa as well. I was not a fan of those and scoop most of them out for my husband, since he enjoys eating them. It's a good thing we occasionally like different things, because I could eat what he doesn't like and he can eat what I don't like. This shop only sells a couple of items on the menu and the main dish would of course be laksa. It would have been nice if there's more variety to laksa like the toppings or more different seasoning. I do like how they posted pictures of celebrities and famous people, on the wall, that had visited the shop back in the days. I could recognize some of the celebrities and it's nice to know they had been here one time, long ago."

In Katong laksa, the noodles are normally cut up into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone, without chopsticks or a fork."" *It is one of the most enjoyable laksa I have! The soup base is so rich with coconut and the hot sauce on the side just add the heat to the noodle itself.

It's a great counter to intake with your laksa noodle soup.The laksa comes out quick and the presentation looks simple yet the smell will make you want to dive right in. All you are given is a spoon.  They say they cut the white, thin, & round noodles enough where you can just spoon it out. I took it upon myself and grabbed some chopsticks elsewhere at broke tradition. Please don't punish me for it, I don't know any better. The coconut-curry soup base is rich and should be attacked immediately when it lands on your table while it's still steaming out of the pot. I'd recommend you adding some of that chili paste to give it a kick. It's really not spicy at all actually. The Thai in me wishes there was vinegar or lime wedges to go with the soup but I wasn't trying to be that picky. I think I killed the bowl within a few minutes. I'm still trying to distinguish if I was just hungry or if that bowl of noodles was just that legit. I'm going to say both. This place is probably known to the world as the joint Chef Gordon Ramsay stopped at. I guess that's why she chose it and I'm glad we checked it out because it was another enjoyable meal. It's a quick bite in a simplistic setting. I'm not surprised if it's cash only. We were lucky to stop by when it wasn't packed and I did notice other tourists meddling around.  I'm now a fan of this curry laksa noodle stuff."

Of course the laksa is a league on its own. Very creamy coconut gravy without overly powering. We added 4-5 of chilli packets and DAMN! We were in Laksa heaven! Every bite and slurp left us wanting for more and before we knew it we almost done with our bowl. I have always knew bout the joint and the owner since she is a well known food celebrity and have always seen her on tv when I was young. Never really thought of going to this joint till today. Well she definitely deserved that celebrity status for this bowl of laksa that she created. The Otahs was served piping hot and it tasted really good. I might get smashed in the face for saying that otah is better than Mexican tamale. But I still gonna say it no matter what. The service was top top. The guy at the counter was really friendly and sweet. Overall we had a totally wonderful experience eating this out-of-this-world Singaporean classic.

The shop itself is rather small, but could house up to 20-30 guests. My husband order the 3 small bowls of the laksa. He also ordered lime juice for himself and luohan longan for me. My mother-in-law was also with us, but she prefered something warm, but the shop does not offer anything warm so she did not want a drink. The order comes right out once he places his order and he brought all the laksa and drinks on a tray to our table. The laksa only comes with a spoon, there's no forks or chopsticks at this shop. I wanted a pair of chopsticks or fork because my noodles were quite long and each time I scoop up the noodles and toppings, all of the noodles would slide right off and only the toppings were left. Eventually I managed to look for the shorter noodles in my bowl and enjoyed those first. Which was pretty good, because there were slices of squid/cuttlefish. There were also small clam-like things in the laksa as well. I was not a fan of those and scoop most of them out for my husband, since he enjoys eating them. It's a good thing we occasionally like different things, because I could eat what he doesn't like and he can eat what I don't like. This shop only sells a couple of items on the menu and the main dish would of course be laksa. It would have been nice if there's more variety to laksa like the toppings or more different seasoning. I do like how they posted pictures of celebrities and famous people, on the wall, that had visited the shop back in the days.

The space was small and although they said they had ""AirCon,"" it was a bit humid inside on the day we visited. There were at least 50 photos plastered on the walls, of celebrities who have slurped in these seats including Anthony Bourdain. But things may have changed since he's dined here. As I said before the laksa was good - with lots of noodles, cockles and prawns floating in a spicy chili and coconut broth. But the servers were mostly unresponsive. Think Soup Nazi - Asian style. But not just one. Many. I will also throw in here that most Singaporeans I have met or know as friends are warm and friendly, including the people working in the service industry. Most will smile and hand you back your Singaporean dollars with both hands - something so simple and polite - yet you don't see that exchange happening much in the states.

It's at the corner of Ceylon and East Coast Road. The place happily promotes that it has AC. Guess it would help out on those hot tropical days. Look for all the pictures of the owner(s) and random celebrities. If you have an issue with milk or coconut milk then this place may be your new arch nemesis. Your bowels will not be pleased if you decide to consume this. Our waiter gave us a whopping 2 seconds before asking what we wanted. I guess there's only laksa available because he asked us which size: small, medium, large. We went for the medium and the Amerrrrrrican in me felt like I should have asked for XL. He then asked if we're okay with shrimp and if we wanted the clam. The shrimp was fine but the clams are quite fishy. If you're not ready for a taste of the ocean sea life, don't ask for the clams. He also murmured some other appetizer which we said sure to. It ended up being this baked curry paste thing wrapped in a banana leaf. Pardon my ignorance if I can't recall the name of it or what it's exactly made of. Damn tourist, at least we gave it a shot and it was just aiight.Next, a random old man came up to us and asked us for drinks. Don't freak out if he asks you to pay on the spot. He's working out of some other stall that doesn't belong to 328 Katong Laksa. Get the barley drink, it's supposedly a Singaporean favorite and out of all the ones I've tried during my time in SG, this was probably one of the better ones. It's a great counter to intake with your laksa noodle soup.The laksa comes out quick and the presentation looks simple yet the smell will make you want to dive right in. All you are given is a spoon.  They say they cut the white, thin, & round noodles enough where you can just spoon it out. I took it upon myself and grabbed some chopsticks elsewhere at broke tradition. Please don't punish me for it, I don't know any better. The coconut-curry soup base is rich and should be attacked immediately when it lands on your table while it's still steaming out of the pot. I'd recommend you adding some of that chili paste to give it a kick. It's really not spicy at all actually. The Thai in me wishes there was vinegar or lime wedges to go with the soup but I wasn't trying to be that picky. I think I killed the bowl within a few minutes. I'm still trying to distinguish if I was just hungry or if that bowl of noodles was just that legit. I'm going to say both. This place is probably known to the world as the joint Chef Gordon Ramsay stopped at. I guess that's why she chose it and I'm glad we checked it out because it was another enjoyable meal. It's a quick bite in a simplistic setting. I'm not surprised if it's cash only. We were lucky to stop by when it wasn't packed and I did notice other tourists meddling around.  I'm now a fan of this curry laksa noodle stuff."

Answered all our questions and gave us good recommendations with a big smile.And of course the only reason here is for the laksa and that's the only thing offers in the menu with the only decision to made is the sizes. When I want to ask for a pair of chopsticks, my Yelp friend realized I did not read up on Katong laksa before my trip as ""Katong laksa is a variant of laksa lemak from the Katong area of Singapore. In Katong laksa, the noodles are normally cut up into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone, without chopsticks or a fork."" *It is one of the most enjoyable laksa I have! The soup base is so rich with coconut and the hot sauce on the side just add the heat to the noodle itself. And eating with a spoon is just awesome as I probably have problem trying to pick up the slippery noodle with my chopsticks anyway.Silent while we enjoying our laksa... I will be happy to have one of this for lunch everyday..*Source from Wikipedia"

They're not so much catered to the hipster crowd.Pick Me Up Cafe prides itself in serving all day dining breakfast, cold pressed juice, home-made yogurt gelato, coffee and all other hearty delights that's sure to pick you up!I found a groupon deal that offered a laser tag game for 5 and a family meal. After the laser tag game we were exhausted, sweaty and couldn't wait to eat dinner!1. Caesar SaladAll the food pretty much came at the same time which we were appreciated, since we were starving. The caesar salad was okay, but abit too much dressing. Veggies tasted fresh and the portion was good.2. Cajun Chicken PizzaWe had 2 pizzas and shared amongst 6 people, 3 guys, 3 girls. It was perfect! It was cheesy enough, the meat was tasty, but the crust, was a bit doughy. Could've been in the oven for a while longer.3. Tutti Frutti This tasted like watermelon juice with fresh coconut jelly in it, it was refreshing and great for us, as we were still trying to cool down from the adrenaline rush from the laser tag!4. Family Waffle $22.90+What makes Pick Me Up a healthier choice is their home-made yogurt gelato! The second we walked in, we took turns trying to pick what flavours we wanted, we were getting a waffle with 4 scoops of gelato!As it is SG50, they have an interesting variety of local flavours. We decided to try the butter pandan kaya.With Taro, Butter Pandan Kaya, Swiss Chocolate, Pistachio, we had our family waffle which was so pretty! There were generous with the toppings! I loved the fruitty pebbles and the waffle itself was crispy on the outside and fluffy like a moist cake on the inside.Perched on top of the family waffle is an caramelized almond bark. The Taro was our favourite as it was very creamy and didn't taste too artificial. The Butter Pandan Kaya tasted like a sea salt kaya, it was so good! I hope they sell this flavour with their regular offerings! The Pistachio and Swiss Chocolate were good as well.I definitely forsee myself coming back to try more gelato flavours.They also sell savoury waffles and all day breakfast sets!"

Always a favorite with some of the nicest folks around.  It's a 'cheers' type bar where everybody will eventually know your name. Beer is inexpensive.  And the clients are mostly 'white' folks as oppose to the Asians. Best part about this place is that you don't have to 'play' pub games.  The ladies at the bar is usually spoken for and its just a really good ol place to hang out and enjoy some nice company. ;)

They show live games here such as cricket and Australian-rules football and rugby, which is refreshing as many pubs solely concentrate on airing soccer matches. The drinks are cheap and reasonable, with some English offerings as well, like Pimms and Boddingtons beer. Only downside is that it closes pretty early at 12-ish am for last drink orders, and they don't inform you for last orders."

I took one bite of my Wolf Burger and was happily in burger heaven- the quality of the burgers at Changi City Point is on Point (sorry for the pun).  And just when I thought it couldn't get better, I tried the Kimchi cheese fries, and oh my, these were DELICIOUS!!! The only let-down is that they do not serve spiked milkshakes as they did in Club Street but the super friendly owner explained that they are keeping their options open so they can also serve a Halal public, so kudos for them being inclusive (and I don't drink during lunchtime on weekdays anyway).I doubted whether they are really worth 5 stars, as there are places which do a better burger but they charge you an arm and a leg. Wolf Burgers manages to do a VERY GOOD burger, their prices are affordable plus their service is excellent: they are quick and efficient and the owner is friendly... and that my friends, is rare in Singapore and deserves five star review."

Some other places I've tried taste more chewy or gummy and therefore more synthetic, but you can just taste the difference in freshness. Each hunk of yam is also tall and generous but you'll get through it faster than you expect! Since we started buying from here, no other yam cake place compares.

Rosu is fattier, and the cut of pork that comes with a strip of fat on the side. Hire is the leaner cut of pork tenderloin. At least in my experience, the katsu comes out consistently fried every time. The bread crumbs are fluffy, extremely crispy and not over fried, pork is moist and tender inside. Skip ordering the other stuff like sushi and sashimi, as they seem to specialize in katsu, or you might get disappointed. The menu also states that their chef is Singaporean, but trained and certified in Japan, working in many high-end establishments before returning home.The only issue here is the slow service. The menu states outright that they will not rush your order, to maintain food quality. They are short handed with only one wait staff out front and the chef at the back.

There was only one chef and one server.The menu is pretty good, as there are lots of different sets you can choose from. As it was our first time there, we opted with the norm. I chose the tonkatsu curry, which totally hit the spot- the pork cutlet had a deep golden colour, was crispy, and the meat was juicy! The soup was typical, nothing to Yelp about, and I did like the refreshing watermelon slices at the end. Prices were good- not cheap but not extremely expensive.This place serves a solid tonkatsu, but I do worry about it. There's signage everywhere that says they will not rush your order even if you ask, as they feel they can't produce the best tonkatsu that way.

Relative to other Tonkatsu places, I've tried: Saboten, Saboten Express, and Teppei Syokudo in Millenia walk, I find Katsuya to be in the middle of the pack -- Better than Saboten Express, but falls short of Saboten and Teppei Syokudo.I'm a repeat customer and order usually one of two dishes: (i) Rosu Set - Pork Loin Katsu Set (Bread Crumb and Deep fried) and (ii) the Rosu Katsudon (Katsu served on an egg rice bowl & Tojio). The Pork Loin, unlike other Katsu places, has a huge layer of fat. This could be a huge turn-off for some people, but I actually prefer it as it makes the Katsu more tender. However, I feel that Katsu skin could be a lot crunchier / more breaded. Unfortunately, I've had some Katsu orders that were a little soggy.  As for the Rosu Katsudon, the taste is what you would normally get from a top-notch Katsudon. However, where Katsuya's Katsudon falls short is for whatever reason is that rice layer underneath the Katsudon is filled with the liquid droppings from the Katsu and egg. I love my rice dry, especially when the restaurant uses high quality Japanese rice. However, if the rice soaked with with liquid, you can't really taste / feel the quality of the rice.  Overall, if you have a Katsu craving and are anywhere near the Katong, this restaurant will surely satisfy your craving. Unfortunately, you will have to drop pretty penny with dishes averaging $25 a pop."

The first thing that we noticed about the menu here is that the food consisted of mainly fried stuff. I am a lover of fried stuff so this is perfectly okay for me, but those who don't like fried stuff might want to take note.Anyway, among the things that we ordered include the Rosu Katsu, Hire Katsu, Ebi and Dory fry, beef katsu and others that I can't remember. All the fried stuff here was great, but the star of the show is no doubt the katsu don, which was absolutely delicious. Highly recommended!"

Opened just 6 months ago, this new business is not a newcomer to the restaurant business. Owner, Nelson shared that he used to run and operate a coffee shop in Toa Payoh selling Chinese Rice and also Chinese Tze Char, and now he has moved to a full-fledged restaurant, while maintaining the same chef and kitchen crew.The menu has something for everyone, seafood items with prawns, squids, mussel/clams, sea cucumbers and mantis prawns are some of the eye-catching menu items for it. It's so hard not to look at the beautiful pictures on the right, screaming ""ORDER US!""There's a list of cooking styles for crabs, the one that stood out for us was the ""Malaysian Kam Heong"" style. Nelson also recommended us to try their salted egg crab, which is a family favourite. The crabs are priced at $68/KG for the night we visited and they are also running a promotion of $48 for 2 crabs (500-600g each)For fish dishes, you can choose between Red Grouper, Sea Bass, Black Grouper and even Cod, each has it's own seasonal price. 1. Deep fried white bait with spices salt $12/$18/$24 This makes a great snack for any meal, the right amount of flour was applied to the white bait, making it extremely crisp and airy. It carried a nice aroma of spices, but with no spiciness to it.2. KL Hokkien Noodles $6/$9/$13My personal favourite of the night, I'm the kind that loves burnt noodles aka noodles with a ton of wok hei. The KL Hokkien noodles here are thick, with a chewy noodle texture along with a thin layer of oily sauce coating the noodles evenly. There is a mix of vegetables, egg and prawns. I definitely see myself coming back for more of this!3. Deep fried fish skin with salted egg $12/$18/$24A rather new tze char item that seems to be popping up in eateries all over is salted egg fried fish skin. The fish skin are very thin, making them crisp and enjoyable. The salmon skin were dusted with salted egg powder  and then deep fried, making them savoury with a pleasant lingering salty aftertaste. The characteristic salted egg flavour was distinct but faded gradually.4. Wok fried crab with spices in ""Malaysia Kam Heong"" styleThis was one huge crab! The pincers were huge and plump with meat! . Kam Heong, literally translated to mean ""golden fragrant"", it does indeed come with a fragrance unique to the dish which I think I shall attribute to the presence of the curry leaves. Very often, I noticed fried crabs, carry the taste of the spices on the crab shell, but the crab meat can taste rather bland.  Aromatic in nature,  due to the dried shrimps, chilies, curry powder, shallots and garlic. Elaborated on the whole yet not too overwhelming that it conceals the freshness of the crabs within.The aroma of the Kam Heong is rather sweet, than spicy. The crab meat for me, was plentiful but I felt that they might have fried the crab for too long, as the crab meat seemed to have shrunk a bit within the shell.5. Deep fried & wok fried crab with salted egg yolk $48/pair (500-600gm each) Salted egg crabs are usually a signature for crabs and with the promo going on, it very enticing to try it! At 500-600g per crab, it's alot smaller than the Kam Heong crab, but it is still filled with lots of juicy and succulent crab meat that absorbed the salted egg flavour very well! The salted egg aroma was subtle but vivid in taste. Overall, I think this would make a great crab option for family with kids, who cannot afford to try the spicier crab cooking style.6. Sea Bass steamed in Nyonya style $30/kg (600-700gm each)The  fish they used was absolutely fresh like still swimming in the curry fresh. Usually curries can afford to use older fish because the heavy curry spice would cover up the scent. At KL Delight Seafood, the curry is milder and light, unveiling the fresh taste of the fish.7. Mantis Prawn Wok fried with minced garlic and chilli powder in ""Hong kong"" style $20/$30/$40 The fried mantis prawn was lightly battered, with give each prawn a thin perimeter of crunchiness, along with a juicy prawn meat in the center. They were generous with the portion of prawns and with the minced garlic and chilli powder. You could easily detect the flavours of the minced garlic in every bite of the mantis prawn. This would make a great starter even for those who can't take spicy foods! Pretty addictive!8. Deep fried yam ring (Dice chicken with cashew nut) $16 or $32Served with overflowing chicken and cashew nuts. I was looking forward to this as I'm a huge fan of Yam Ring. It was slightly crispy on the surrounding and the yam was of the right consistency, the flavour of the yam could've been more pronounced as I felt that it was a tad too bland. The chunks of juicy chicken meat however tasted much better with a distinct sweetness covering the entire chicken!"

Da bomb burger would win an instagram competition for burgers if there was one! So I had to try it!1. Da Bomb Burger $19+For a 250g of beef patty, this sure is a huge burger, to finish this off as one person, you must be starving to death! The egg was running and it presented very nicely on an IKEA chopping board, the fries however were very salty.Both burgers came with super salty fries, my suggestion if you don't want to get bloated from drinking water from the beakers, is tell them LESS SALT on the fries.2. The Club Burger $19+The chicken was very juicy and succulent, it was very marinated and grilled. I enjoyed it as much as I had enjoyed the Da Bomb. Both are good choices for burgers here! The side salad had watermelon cubes in there, though they were not sweet, it was a refreshing change from the normal cucumbers.Both da bomb and the club seen side by side, they look normal sized, but in person, they're pretty huge. For the price, I find it reasonable.3. Red Velvet Cake 6.50+At 4pm on a saturday, this was already the last slice of red velvet cake, this goes to show how popular this cake is! It was moist and the cream cheese was slightly salty, the sweetness of the cream cheese was just alright, not too overpowering. But you could feel gerlat eating this cake all by yourself. So share the calories!4. Meatballs $10+$10+ for 6 meatballs, pretty pricey if you ask me, but the cheese was well baked over the meatballs. The meatballs were most probably deep fried before getting baked, as the exterior were really crispy!The marinara sauce for the meatball was perfect, pretty sure you could eat fries with this sauce too, it wasn't too salty.Water is served here in beakers :) an interesting touch for a ""Lab""For each customer, you get one test tube of complimentary fruit juice, all the juices tasted weird and we couldn't tell what colour was what juice, even after tasting. Mostly because all were too diluted?"

Was given an outdoor seat as it was packed on the inside and we had to switch seat as the scorching sun pointed directly at where we were seating. The main dishes looks good on the social media so the five of us shared the Da Bomb and The Club burgers as well as meatballs for the side dish. Depending on what you get, the prices are definitely on the steep side.For the burgers, they are juicy and tasty (all the ingredients mixed with the buns). There were sides of fries on the wooden board (serving plate) and the fries were too salty. Had only three pieces of that and I am still feeling dryness on the throat and thirstiness even a day later. The meatballs were cooked rightly. It was not too much and the tomato based as well as the layer of cheese on its top was a good combination for moisting the beef balls. No picture on it as it wasn't a photo friendly dish.I also tried the Tokio tea. According to the menu, it is one of the lab's recommended beverage and looking at the fruity description, I ordered this to try it out. For the price, it was a little on the pricier end but I would probably go for a cold beverage if I visit this place a second time.We also tried the Red Velvet cake. It was pretty moist and would recommend it to others. Towards the end of the meals, we were given juices to sample in test-tubes. Not sure what tastes they were but I got the orange flavored one. Oh yes, and the iced water came in conical flasks or beakers (glad that I finally remembered the name for the flask).The interior design was unique as it was science related. There are also interesting facts about fruits and its benefits on one of the walls. Quite a nice place to wind down the week if there are less crowds."

And they don't have a ""no outside cake policy"". The last time I ate at Pasta Fresca was about 15 years ago and why the long no-show. Well, in my opinion, their pasta was getting too expensive for the average taste that they provide.  Plus they were no longer the only pasta place around and I could get cheaper for better. Oh well, fast forward 15 years and I read pretty decent reviews and decided to try again. And I must say, my faith is restored. While I'm not gonna say they have the best-est pasta in Singapore, they are pretty darn good. We had:* Vongole Pescatora (Tomato) - a most delightful clam soup! Made me wanna re-create it at home!* Polpa Di Granchio with Linguine - crabmeat pasta in tomato sauce which was really really good! We ordered food to share and this dish just disappeared in seconds! I didn't even have a chance with seconds (pun fully intended!!) * Lasagne Gratinate Emil - I thought the taste was nice. A kinda mild taste. Not bad or anything. Just mild. Forgettable tho. * Prama Ham Pizza - generous serving of ham slices. Good. * Capricciosa Pizza - one of the recommended pizzas and I do agree. It's has a bit of everything so it's good. * Mascarpone Pizza - apparently a new addition to the menu. I like it! I like how the drops of mascarpone cheese balances the saltiness of the Parma ham slices. Easily my best pizza of the nightService is attentive and no charges for water (yay!). They even provided plates and spoons for our ""outside"" cake. Total bill was $140 which honestly was not too bad! I'm definitely coming back! Just for the soup and crabmeat pasta!"

The seafood on the marinara pizza could have been better but would still say above average. The penne arrabiata was amazing for me, fresh pasta and just honest good sauce with just the right hints of herb did the job. Finished off with a great tiramisu shared. It was a generous portion and enough for two to share. My benchmark is The old Amici's at HV - this one was very good but not yet there.Service was also pleasantly good for a Saturday evening.

It's a pretty spacious place with tacky decor (think fake brick arches, happy farmers harvesting in the fields type murals) and impersonal service. While the service staff are prompt with their iced water refills, they usually congregate around the front of the restaurant. I know not why. The usual orders are the baked eggplant with cheese and tomato as a starter, and a pasta and a pizza. I usually go for either the carbonara or the puttanesca, even though they're easily recreated. I'm rather partial to the eggplant though; it's all smooth, cheesy and tomatoey goodness, very yummy. Pastas are ok, not great, and not as al dente as I'd like. That said, this hasn't affected its customer base very much. Pasta Fresca has been here for ages, and looks like it'll continue this way."

Items I'd recommend here would be the four cheese pizza and the pasta which you can put together yourself. The pizzas come with generous toppings while the pasta are done al dente and the cream base isn't too overwhelming.

I hardly stray from my usual orders because they're so good, I can find no reason to order anything else. When ordering a pasta dish, you can choose any type of pasta you want. I recommend the spaghetti, fettucine and pappardelle. Their tomato base is excellent.The one thing I like about their pizzas is that the crust isn't too thin. I like the crust to have a certain kind of volume to it and not be biscuit thin.If you're a fan of Italian food, I highly recommend Pasta Fresca. Did I mention that tiramisu is pretty awesome too?"

But, Babalicious' owner - the famous Tong Fong Fatt 东风发 chicken rice chain - has managed to, somehow, kept their chicken tasting so good & tender all these years. Kudos to them for doing that!Recently, I've been having Chicken Rice cravings & have been going to this eatery quite often. Always left feeling very satisfied.I must also add that their Chicken Rice Chilli is really sedap (delicious) and quite spicy. Just a little sprinkle of the chilli sauce & garlic sauce does the trick for me. 2. Good serviceTheir service is prompt and efficient, and they serve free water! I'm always pleasantly surprised that they serve my water immediately after I asked for it. After I have tried more of their dishes, I will update my review again. But, I foresee myself going there just for their Chicken Rice (just like many other folks i think). Try it and let me know how you like it!"

You can't really find nice coffee around the area. They use Italian beans for their coffee so the coffee is strong and flavorful. Pretty low acidity and full nodied kind of coffee.Another signature item on their menu is their carrot cake. They bake it on their own and it's really nice and fluffly.

Overall, the meal was satisfying and I was quite pleased. Thai iced tea (Red), Pad Thai, and Papaya Salad. I'd say the papaya salad was my favorite as it tasted most similar to what I've had in Thailand. The Pad Thai, in my opinion didn't taste as authentic but was still good. The Thai iced tea was not overly sweet which was nice too. I'll have to try the green Thai iced tea next time. Service was good and seemed to be pretty attentive at the time. They also provided water. Atmosphere, pretty chill and more open so it was warm but there were fans so that is nice. I'd recommend and would come back here for Thai food.

The prices are amazing for the quality of food you get - $6 on average for noodle dishes e.g. pad thai as well as rice dishes e.g. pineapple fried rice. 90% of the stuff on the menu is under $9, and they don't skim on the portions either.I love the pandan fried chicken - succulent chunks of marinated chicken wrapped tightly in pandan leaves and deep fried. They come in plates of 4, which I can easily mop up all by myself because it's that yummy and yes I'm a glutton. I order it every single time and I'm still not tired of it.Another must-have is the thai style kang kong, served in a stylish elevated dish. It's very tasty, but I usually tell them to go easy on the chili padi. The tom yam soup is extremely extremely spicy. Which isn't to say it's not delicious and addictive in a masochistic kinda way. Like your tongue is already on fire and instead of putting the fire out you just wanna douse it with more delicious fuel. Piece of advice: share it with someone or you'll spend the entire night in the bathroom.I've tried the pad thai, pad see ew and pineapple fried rice, all of which are authentic and great complements to the spicy dishes. Oh and if you love cereal prawns but hate to peel them, they serve their cereal prawns half peeled. For some magical reason the prawns remain juicy even though they're cooked without their shells, and they're buried until a TON of cereal which goes great with pretty much everything.And finally, red ruby and mango sticky rice for dessert. If you have to pick one, go with the red ruby. It's not too sweet and is extremely refreshing after a spicy meal. Plus the milkiness puts out whatever fire you induced into your mouth.Definitely go there with a bunch of friends and share as many things as possible. Try to go early, like before 11.30am for lunch and before 6pm for dinner, or be prepared to queue."

It may not look glamourous, but the cost of the food is cheaper than its competitors but the quality of the food makes up for it. I enjoy every spoonful of Tom Yum soup which may be spicy to some and had a bit of difficulty finishing it. The main dishes that came along with the soup are fabulous. The Basil Beef and Pineapple Rice are my favourites. Since the queue is long, there should be a timing for the every customers, as some of them take their own sweet time finishing their food!

Once you step into the shop, you'd be transported to the back alleys of Bangkok with all that upbeat Thai pop tempo, mouthwatering waft of hot delicious food and the friendly smiles and eager to please faces of the servers. The Pineapple Fried Rice (S$6) is a standard dish that i would order here. The sweetness of the pork floss goes perfectly with the slightly curried Thai rice which is slightly fluffy and chewy. I like that it is not too dry. The rice is fried with shrimps, cashew nuts and raisins and best eaten with Green curry! Almost every table had an order of this. Nakhon used to serve this in a pineapple but i guess it was too troublesome for them. A Thai meal is never complete without Tom Yam Soup and Nakhon has 2 different types, 1 thick base and 1 clear, with the option of Seafood, Shrimp or Chicken (S$6). The milky base is the less spicy option with some tomatoes added to neutralize the acidity. I personally prefer the clear base. It looks innocuous enough but boy that chili padi in the soup can kill. It's a clean and sweet taste with tartness to it in your first mouthful. Amazingly addictive but u may feel that acid biting into your stomach after.Awesome and affordable thai food right this way!"

I used to think that they were just slow at serving food and clearing tables, allowing the queue to form, until I tried it out for myself.In contrary to what I initially thought, service at Nakhon was quick and efficient. Despite the seemingly long queue, the wait for a table was not more than 15 mins. The staff took down my order while I was still in the queue so the food came almost immediately once we got a table. However, do not expect immaculate service here at Nakhon. Probably due to the busyness of the restaurant, the staff can be rather impatient when dealing with customers. Food is cheap and good! It is cheaper than restaurant chains such as Thai Express, yet I find it more authentic. I really enjoyed the Clear Tom Yum Soup they serve, as well as the Thai Mango Salad and their Phad Thai. I have reservations about their green curry though, as I have had inconsistent experiences with it. The first time I had it, it was thick and flavourful but my recent orders of green curry have been disappointing. The green curry has recently become pretty diluted, with fewer chicken and mushroom pieces. Overall, I would still recommend Nakhon as a good place to go for affordable, yummy Thai food. Go early for dinner (around 5-ish pm) if you want to avoid the queue!"

That the restaurant is staffed entirely by Thais should be an obvious sign of authenticity.At dinnertime, there's almost always a 30 minute wait to be seated at Nakhon Kitchen, even on weekday evenings. I wouldn't dream of coming here for dinner on weekends, so I don't know how crazy a Saturday or Sunday queue can get. Once you're seated, however, service is prompt and your dishes are served in no time.Pineapple Fried Rice, $6.00 - One of the few non-spicy dishes on the menu, the pineapple fried rice here at Nakhon Kitchen is lightly curried, sweet, and nicely complemented by raisins and a light sprinkle of pork floss. Pretty average, but nevertheless useful to have this on hand if you're ordering the tom yam soup.Black olive fried rice with minced chicken, $6.00 - If you're not a believer of fruits in your rice, you've got another carb option in the form of olive fried rice. I actually prefer it to the pineapple rice, as the salty fragrance of olives and siew dam (a dark, syrupy Thai soy sauce) pervades every grain of rice in on that plate. The accompanying chopped raw onions and cashew nuts add a welcome crunch to each spoonful of rice as well.Tom Yam Soup, $6.00 - Ah, the tom yam soup. Where do I even begin? If you're one of those people who have no problem at all with spice, by which I mean you're capable of eating baby red chillies without breaking into a sweat, then you'll enjoy this. Objectively speaking, this is very good soup - it's filled with the distinctive aroma of lemongrass and has a satisfyingly tangy taste due to the addition of tomatoes. Generous serving of fresh seafood within as well.Thai vermicelli salad with seafood, $6.00 - Don't be fooled by the deceptively mild appearance of the yam talay here. I used to find this salad incredibly spicy, but after drinking the tom yam soup this yam talay seems to possess the spice level of a Happy Meal. That metaphor doesn't even make sense, but I trust you understand what I mean. Sour, fiery and refreshing, this vermicelli salad functions as an excellent palate cleanser and whets your appetite for the dishes to follow.Kang Kong Belachan, $6.00 - When my conscience is niggling from all that pigging (wa I'm a poet), this stir-fried veggie dish is something I always order to try and make myself feel better. Like oily vegetables will negate the effects of the other dishes from hell that I'm eating. The kangkong served at Nakhon Kitchen is crunchy and nicely infused with the fragrance of fried garlic as well as the shrimpy flavour of belachan. Only gripe is that it could be a little less oily.Stir-fried minced pork with basil leaves, $6.00 - This dish is a must-order for me every time I visit. Basil leaves are an acquired taste for most, and to me they taste wretched when consumed in isolation. They remind me of liquorice, which I happen to be terrified of. I do, however, think they're excellent when they lend their flavour to stir-fried meats. Nakhon Kitchen's rendition of pork and basil is one of the best there is.The more observant among you would probably have noticed that the dishes reviewed in this article all cost $6.00. Split between three, it works out to a reasonably priced dinner. Plus the food's great, which makes this place is one of my favourite Thai eateries in Singapore. Just a gentle heads up, in case you haven't realised what I've been repeatedly driving across - the spice level here isn't for the faint-hearted. This is value-for-money Thai food that packs a lethal punch, and I'd advise you to come prepared for your stomach lining to bear the consequences of your meal."

The average service standards in Singapore are beyond appalling in general, when compared to service in the US, Japan and Bali. But this place takes the cake in bad service, even by Singapore standards! Service is several notches below norm in Singapore. When we asked her something, she didn't bother to reply, appeared to mutter something and walked off rudely. If this restaurant was in any city in the US, ANY city, it wouldn't last beyond six months with such appalling service and mediocre food. The food is extremely mediocre. I've had much better Thai food anywhere. The Thai seafood curry was watery and flavorless.

Probably like me, people would rather come nearby to satisfy their cravings for thai food rather than go to town area.I do like their thai fish cake, pandan chicken, green curry, pineapple rice and tom yam soup though. Maybe the taste is hard to wrong but i don't mind the wait and slightly over-priced meals. Once in awhile dining here would be fine. So it's really up to individual people's opinion i guess."

I am not going to talk about the food here but instead I am going to highlight their efficient queuing system. When you're in line,  up till the 3rd or 4th person, your order is being taken concurrently so by the time you're seated, your food comes, saving all the frustration from having to order and wait yet again. This system has worked well obviously as many customers are satisfied to queue because they know the line moves fast and they will not be kept waiting once seated. The length of the queue is testimony of how good the food is so don't be put off by the long line!"

It was moist and flaky and you could really taste the Earl Grey. Once we did sit down (pretty uncomfortable sitting unfortunately), we ordered the molten eggs. So good.

But it works. This cute little cafe is away from any competition (compared to the densely populated cafes in Tiong Bahru or Tanjung Pagar area) and just a stone throw away from my current office. You can easily missed this place if you're here for the first time, so look out for their banner hung outside the association and just follow the sign. The cafe is located at the back of the building, btw. We came here for lunch one weekday and love everything about this place. The owner, Gwen is friendly and always so welcoming with her warm smile. I ordered a latte and was asked which coffee blend I prefer. Since it was my first time, I asked for a recommendation and they recommended an African blend with a hint of chocolate and citrus. Very nice. Also, all coffee comes in double shot, which is slightly too strong for me.  I had a slight ""heart attack"" the moment I finished my coffee and had to dilute the caffeine with a lot of plain water. Haha. It could be the main draw why people come for their coffee - for it is strong! The food menu could be limited but I salute café that concentrates on a few items and do it right and B&B is one of them. I had a chicken and mushroom grilled Panini while my colleagues had curry chicken Panini. All food is prepared fresh upon order hence the waiting time of 15-20 mins. But that's alright, nobody wants to eat frozen or food that has been sitting in the refrigerator for days. The chicken and mushroom as well as the curry chicken filling for the Panini were flavorful paired with a handful of fresh rockets. Portion wise, it was just right as it leave you with some space for dessert. We ordered a dark chocolate tart to share to finish off the meal nicely.  B&B together with a couple of cafes like DOC and Drury Lane will remain my favorite and foresee myself coming back again and again."

The large windows bathe the space in natural light and the space owes everything to the prevailing hipster look.But the comforts end there.Stealing from fast food outlets who prefer a fast flow of customers, Brawn and Brains' stools are small and hard. The offered comfort doesn't promote a ""sit around and chat"" atmosphere.Brawn and Brains promote the a coffee conscious image. If all I cared about was image I could happily buy into this outlet. However I love coffee more than I love how it is housed. The coffee is so-so. Having lived around the Mediterranean for many years, I can't excuse a venue that doesn't include water with their coffee. Not only is coffee dehydrating and cloying without water, but the water helps clean the palate and keep the mouth fresh. Disappointingly Brawn and Brains didn't offer water immediately and refused to offer tap water.  The only option is imported water.The food is ok but was western themed. It was a little cliched with the dish coming with packet crisps. Very few local people were eating here, mostly Europeans and North Americans, presumably looking for a reminder of home. For a traveller in this area, why not just eat something local instead? There is a great selection of low price food and authentic cooking along Geylang road. Even ""The tuckshop"" up the road would be a better place to drop in.If I was looking for a coffee I would have wanted to head to Collective Brewers, but now they have closed down. Instead, I'd rather head to ""Curious Palette"" on Prinsep street, or, if I can get in, ""Space Mob"", at 8 Claymore Hill."

The team behind this cafe obviously care a lot about the way it looks & feels.The coffee was also excellent - easily one of the best cups I've had in Singapore. I neglected to ask exactly who roasted it but I will definitely be back to try some more. Unfortunately the location is a little out of the way but Guillemard Road is close enough to where I live to make it worth a trip out.The star gets knocked off for the uncomfortable seating. I get that you're a hole in the wall serving only drinks & pastries but that's still no excuse for trying to force patrons out by way of uncomfortable seating. Having said this, Brawn & Brains is the only place I've ever hesitated on before taking the one-star backless-seating demerit. And that says something."

Worth the longer than normal wait. Seats could be more comfortable (got sore waiting for food to arrive), perhaps some cushions would help?Recommended for take away coffee or lazy weekend brunch (byo cushions)."

She was alone managing the cafe that has 5 people including us who just walked in. She set us down very nicely whilst continuing to prep a sandwich for the other customer. After serving that customer, she took our order of coffee and went about preparing our drink, using the Brazilian bean that we chose out of the 2 offerings (the other being a Sumatran). Not once did she showed any haste or panic to deliver and we were extremely impressed especially when a little 2 year old (there-about) gal threatened to wreck the entire cafe apart with her wilful behaviour, with her dad being a slave to her actions. And not surprisingly, she spilled the dad's entire cup of iced mocha all over the floor but Gwen simply went about to coax the little girl from crying, etc. Full thumbs up for her immaculate service. Extra brownie points for the not-too-sweet banana cake that she somehow managed to baked whilst all these drama was unfolding in the shop.Hopefully they will start roasting in house soon and will drop by again for another cuppa.Parking is easy but watch the clock ticking as it's gantry-cashcard based."

I preferred the Sumatra Lintong + Colombia blend: fuller body and flavour. And that slice of lemon cream cheese bundt cake was just what I needed this afternoon. Will be looking to come back!"

It doesn't have a strong bitter taste while retaining the strong coffee taste. Possibly one of the nicest coffee I have taken to date."
