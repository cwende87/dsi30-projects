Recently moved from Yishun, the young owners are really energetic in serving quality food in huge portions, to fill up some healthy protein calories!One glance at the menu and you can see that the prices are reasonable with a wide variety of food options.Mains like    Grilled Cajun Chicken    Chicken Breast Schnitzel    Fried Breaded Fish    Grilled Miso Pork LoinJust to name a few are $7.90 and comes with 2  hot sides / cold salads.There's also 7 types of pasta such as    Carbonara with Poached Egg $6.90    Seafood Cream Pasta $6.90    Chicken & Bacon Marinara $6.90    Seafood Marinara $6.90The food spread here is simply scrumptious and any meat lover however broke you are, would definitely still able to dine here!First up! The Chops! XXL Platter (Feed 6-8pax) $59.90 Served with the following :- Grilled Cajun Chicken- Fried Breaded Fish- Grilled Garlic Pork Collar- Panfry Norwegian Salmon *My Favourite*- Australian Grain Fed Ribeye Steak- Spice BBQ Babyback Ribs (half rack)  *My Favourite*Look at that variation of browness of the skin! I knew at first sight, it was love and also a very crispy salmon skin! The salmon meat itself tasted fresh and pretty much melted in my mouth.Next up, the highlight was the ribs. I was just at Morganfield's the day before and oh boy! These are the next best thing and not to mention, it's in my hood. Definitely coming back for more. Why? Because it was tender, who needs a knife actually? A fork is more than sufficient to gently rub the tender meat off the bones. It left a lingering sweetness, very characteristic of the BBQ sauce.All the other meats tasted good. No complaints whatsoever, other than having to get the steak put back on the grill for a bit. But check out the serving portions in relation to a hand. Yes I know from this angle, anyone would suffer from parallax error but still. Chops definitely serves the hungry with a passion!Served with 10 hot sides / cold salads, consisting of - Cherry Tomatoes- Potato and Egg Salad- Tuna Salad- Romaine Lettuce- Coleslaw- Garlic Fried Rice- Mash Potato- Shoestring Fries- Aglio Olio- Mac & Cheese *My Favourite*So much sides! 6 different carbs to choose from and 4 veggies. This is a food pyramid that HPB wouldn't smile about, but hey! It's an inverted food pyramid!I was really in love with the Mac & Cheese, they use nacho cheese in the sauce to give it an distinct sweetness with every macaroni. The garlic fried rice was very fragrant and flavourful despite it's simple appearance.Overall : For $59.90, and with 20-30 minutes time of waiting, DEFINITELY worth waiting, and it's in Ang Mo Kio, so North folks REJOICE! Other this is only 10 minutes walk from AMK MRT and still decent quality meats and sides for everyone!My verdict :  AWESOME food and CHEAP prices with a couple of young good-looking owners who are really into serving great food!"

After paying for order, one would be given a pagar which would light up when order is ready for collection.Grilled Garlic Pork Collar ($7.90)Served with 2 sides of choiceAt first wanted to order Grilled Miso Pork Loin but not available. The staff recommended me this dish which was most similar to the dish I wanted. Based the display of side dishes, I decided on Cauliflower Cream Cheese and Tuna Salad for my sides. The tuna salad was mixed with juliennes of red pepper and raw onions, which tasted refreshing and crisp. The cauliflower was soft and moist, crusted with a layer of melted cheese. The pork was tender and cut through easily, served with a side of black pepper sauce."

The food is fantastic, service is ehh (our waiter constantly struggled to finish his train of thought when trying to explain something or answering one of our my queries), ambience, well, it's a little run-down (its Geylang after all).In terms of the stars of the show, the Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab respectively, they were solid and every bit satisfying. The sauce of the Chilli Crab was definitely on the spicy side, but not unbearable. I still prefer the thick, sweet, slightly spicy sauce of the Jumbo Seafood Chilli crab, but nonetheless the Chilli crab at Penang Seafood restaurant was a good alternative. The Pepper Crab was unique. It was the first time I tried a saucy Black Pepper Crab. The ones I'm used to are definitely not drenched with all that pepper, but smatterings of pepper here and there. Surprisingly, it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. Overall, a great location to grab Malaysian/Singapore seafood favorites. I still prefer Jumbo's Chilli crab or Long Beach's Black Pepper Crab outright. However, if you factor the roughly 20-30% discount offered at Penang Seafood for the very same dishes vs. those offered at SG's famous seafood chains, then the comparison is just about even. :D"

She recommended Penang Seafood Restaurant which is just a stone throw away from Ajunied Station.The Penang Restaurant which is also serving Cze Char is bustling with people. Not to worry about the seats as the turn over rate there is rather high. Servers are rather polite and quick to attend to our orders.The environment gave a feel that we are in Malaysia and even the variety of drinks they served is so closed to what the usual coffeeshops in Malaysia offers, Ice Jelly, Herbal Tea and even Lime juice with sour plum.Lime Juice - $2 EachThe safest choice to order if you are lost among the dishes in the extensive menu. If you have heard of Penang Cuisine, Assam Laksa is one of their staple dishes. This signature dish of theirs is sour by default with Tamarind (Asam). Look around the tables, I bet you will see majority ordering this. And if you like sour and sweet food, this is a perfect choice as the bowl is filled with ingredients like shredded cucumbers, onions, chillis, pineapple, lettuce and mackerel fish. The level of sourness is very well executed and appetizing. Better than average and its addictive.Penang Assam Laksa - $4.80 (Small)Penang style of Char Kway Teow is usually not of my preference as I prefer the Singaporean style that is usually coated with the sweet black sauce. Surprisingly, these plate of flat rice noodles was remarkable with its ""Wok Hei"" taste coupled with ingredients like bean sprouts, cockles, chinese sausage, prawn, guchai and egg. Its aromatic but just too bad, the man insisted that he prefers our local style.Penang Char Kway Teow - $5 (Small)With Salted Egg Yolk trend still in the hype, they have kept their food menu up to date! With this being the chef recommended dish, I had expected more with something outstanding. No doubt the sauce is creamy and yummy, the dish still lacked the fragrant as well as the Wow factor.Fried Sotong with Salted Egg - $13 (Small)Beware of the steaming hot plate below the bloated aluminum pack. Loving the way how this dish is prepared in the aluminum pack and slit open in front of us when being served on our table. Herbal taste is evidently packed with an alcohol infused whiff from the Chinese wine. Steamy herbal soup is sweetened with the use of sweet dates and wolf berries. Beside that, ginger strips and mushrooms were also part of their ingredient. All was good except that I'm not too keen with chicken with bones bits in it.Hot Plate Wine Chicken - $16 (Small)Penang Seafood Restaurant offers a decent fare of Cze Char dishes and since there are many other signature dishes like LaLa and Hokkien Mee that we have yet to try out. I don't mind coming back again."

The queue was long on a Saturday night, at around 830pm. The guy managing the line and order taking was very efficient. He remembered where people were seated and what they ordered. What took us by surprise was that if you only have 2-5 in your group, you could be sharing a big round table with other parties of 2-5 too. The good thing, your wait could be halved. The bad thing, it was hard to have a proper conversation with everyone seated along the curve of the table. Our table had 3 other groups of diners. It was a bit disconcerting to say the least. There are a few numbers on the big table to indicate the various parties. We did not try the zi char dishes though the fish curry which seemed to be a favorite of many tables looked delicious. The Penang dishes we had, while good, were a bit underwhelming. Maybe our expectations were high after reading the good reviews on Yelp and other personal blogs. Char Kway Teow - the spiciest of the 3 noodles dishes. The squeeze of lime cut the grease a little and added a zesty refreshing taste to the otherwise lard laden rich dish. There were tiny cockles (quite yum), sliced lap cheong (chinese sausage), sliced fishcake, prawns and beansprouts. Best to share as it can get a bit too much after a while. I did not detect much of a char (wok hei) taste to it. Assam Laksa - very good assam gravy which was very thick and full of flavor. The fish did not disintegrate into tiny bits like in most places, but you could find a few full pieces of fish. A generous lashing of hae kor (prawn paste sauce) was added to the dish when served. Penang Hokkien Mee - this was what we called prawn noodle soup. I liked this even though the soup was not one of the best. It was good enough with an acceptable prawn taste to the soup. We ordered the small prawns and they were really small, almost like the dried shrimp if they shrink any further. The soup was a bit spicy but the noodle itself was fine."

What I go for are three dishes - the char koay teow, Penang laksa and the Penang Hokkien Mee. The char koay teow comes close to Penang-style ones but the noodles they use are slightly thinner compared to those you can find in Penang but taste wise is pretty similar.The Penang laksa here has a thick assam gravy which is a bit different from those in Penang, In fact, Penang laksa is a bit more watery and soupy.

Can't really say it's authentic Penang flavour but it certainly was the best I've had in Singapore. The koay teow they used is thin and light in colour but extremely tasty. Their salted egg sotong is also very good. Highly recommend this place; cheap good food!"

NO GRAVY, but the seasoning is sufficient already (bottle of fish sauce on standby at the counter) FREE FLOW of PORK LARD which I decided not to take advantage of since there were more than enough of that crispy wickedly fragrant bits in my $4-bowl. If you prefer those saucy or moist version, this might not be your kind of wanton Mee. And neither will it transport you to the sweet, sour spicy Thai paradise. It's simple and aromatic. Thankfully there were juicy meaty wantons in the soup to counteract the dryness in the bowl. Yes, the noodles clumped together, but I can always separate it with my chopsticks."

My masseuse always win because she is REALLY good and she is near the skytrain and I have zero-tolerance for traffic jams and dishonest drivers. Today, I HAPPENED to drive through CTE and decided to GPS into the famed Soi 19 wanton noodles birthed at Ang Mo Kio, to get my Thai wanton noodle fix. Boy, was I glad that at 10plus in the morning, there is no queue!  Since I have not had breakfast, I ordered the $5 bowl (#2). It was substantial with 2 fried wontons, 2 wantons in soup, char siew and lup cheong. Fortunately, i was already armed with small dishes of pickled green chilli, chilli flakes, and pork lard. One bite into the noodles : it was sweet!  I know the Thais put lots of sugar in their food BUT wanton noodles are not meant to be sweet. So I doused it with chilli flakes, pickled green chilli & more pork lard.  I wanted to book an airticket to fly to Bangkok right away to have my proper authentic fix.  On my way home, I can't wait to write this review as I am dying of thirst from MSG attack. Yup, I would not take this noodle chain again, even if in the vicinity. It is OK but it fell way below my expectations. It is not Thai wanton noodles. It is Thai Wannabe wanton noodles. I now can understand why SABx2 put up signs to disassociate themselves from the Singapore stall. The Singapore stall should stop using Soi 19. It is a marketing ploy. Actually, I suspect that this stall started out as authentic until they start branching out......"

One point of departure compared to other prawn noodles places is that there wasn't a pork taste here, just seafood (apparently they do use pork so I guess it's quite subtle). Personally I like the strong pork element (ergo the 4 Star rating) but if you don't you probably will enjoy this even more than I did.The prawns are quite big - $8 gets you 3, and they are super fresh (the ones I had tasted like live prawns). As mentioned the soup had no pork taste so it was unsurprising that there were no pork ribs, unlike in other prawn noodle places. Instead there were fresh clams inside.As for the noodles, there was only bee hoon when we were there, and there's little variance in that - they were OK.The portion is quite big here too, so it's no wonder the queue was pretty long even at 8pm."

One can also topup $2.90++ to complete the meal with a mushroom soup and a choice of either vanilla ice-cream, long black coffee or Earl Grey tea.The mushroom soup was filled with cubes of button mushroom and smelt nice of truffle oil.

Duck Confit ($14.50++ )Signature whole duck leg, slow-cooked to perfection, crispy outside, tender inside.Served with mushroom ragout, mesclun salad, mashed potato, and shallot balsamico sauce.The staff recommended me the above dish for the lunch promotion, which was offered to replace the out of stock Pan-Seared Smoked Duck Breast. The meat was quite tender with crispy skin. Although it was a tab too salty but it balance quite well with the slightly sweet and sour shallot balsamico sauce. The salad was dressed with a sweet and tangy dressing. For $9.90++, it was quite a steal.Overall the food was delicious and served quite fast. It was quite a filling meal too."

I know this may not be a fair comparison but once you had experienced the right real thing in the mid-west your expectation will not be the same again. 3.5 stars for the Pork ribs. What disappointed me a bit was that its fish n chip which has a nice beer-bartered version uses frozen dory fish fillet - good if they can provide a local fresh fish option. The staffs were friendly and provided good services. I'll come back for their steaks. By the way there's a neon sign along the main with ""Best Steak in Town"" message that you will not miss driving past :-)"

We ordered two mains: Milk fed veal spare ribs and another ribeye. I might have had a super high expectation of this place since I read a whole lot of good reviews. No complains for the milk fed veal. However, the ribeye was a tad bit disappointing. The  texture was great, but the only complain is that it was a bit too bland. A bit of salt could have brought out more flavour.  Honestly, I think Aston's (Safra Toa Poyoh) could have prepared a better piece. We also ordered the oysters, a weekend special. It was a disappointment. It definitely didn't smell or look too fresh. At one point, we were both rather hesitant to eat one or two of them. Maybe dinner might have been a better time to try rather than lunch. Maybe we happen to be there when Chef Amri wasn't around. Maybe we weren't in luck to try a better piece. Maybe, maybe.....

Each dish was mouth watering.It was my first time eating Crab Bee Hoon and the soup was unbelievable heavenly. The crab roe melted in the soup bringing out the taste of crab. The Bee Hoon which sucked the soup was just as nice eating it without soup. Other dishes was equally good especially the Guiness Pork Ribs which had beer added into it.

We order a pulled pork sandwich and a burger. We ordered Erdinger which is available at Happy Hour prices up to 8pm. Service was friendly, although our server was a little wary of our ""big"" dog under the table. The service was also quick.  The pulled pork sandwich was a hit, with nice smoky flavor to the sauce. The burger was also very tasty with two small (OK, I confess to ordering the double) but thick patties. They were a little crumbly, but I was fine with this given the taste. Erdinger was the same as always. Despite a sitting outside, there was a nice breeze that kept the area cool.

And perhaps that is its biggest hurdle in standing out amongst the crowd. If there is one signature dish in the menu, I haven't found it.Buffalo wings were okay. For additional chilli heat, you have to add more money to the wings. I feel this choice of pricing is calculating. Generally, you'd find places with these sort of levels of heat, having an ultimate level, for which if you can finish the whole plate, you get the wings free. If it had that, I wouldn't take so much offense with the penny pinching pricing. I had a level five. It was hot enough for unpleasant things to leak from my nose. Your tolerance level may be greater.The batter for the fish and chips was great. Very light. A pretty high standard for Singapore I think, but if you've had fish and chips in Scotland, it pales. The fish was a tad smelly. It wasn't the freshest of frozen fish. They do not offer vinegar and salt as an option.Lamb rack was okay. Was not overdone. Still pink. But taste-wise it was just okay. My complaint with our lamb racks here is that we seem to have only mini-lamb suppliers, there's so little meat on them.Pork ribs is served with the sauce on the side, rather than brushed on the meat. On appearance it looks leathery dry and I think brushing on the sauce would make it more succulent, or at least appear so. However, the sauce is very salty and if spread all over the ribs it gets too cloying. For lack of a better way to put this, I think the sauce is lacking originality.Oxtail pasta was boring.On the two separate times, I had fellow diners who selected the set lunch. On one set lunch, the dessert was a tiny slice of banana cake that was actually quite pleasant. Banana cake normally has a heavy handed taste of essence of banana or whatever, but this one didn't seem to have it. It could be because it was such a small slice I couldn't tell.I find that there seems to be more effort made for the dessert. In the plating of the dessert, you can see thought and effort put in. It's a pity that the dessert station isn't right at the front, near the main entrance. I think there is something promising there, but not enough to inspire me to walk from my table to the far end of this not-very-large establishment.This review particularly hard to write because it's neither exceptionally bad or exceptionally good. And so while I think I can re-visit this place for a meal, it would just be an uneventful, rather unmemorable time. I'm not sure if the location or the price warrants going out of one's way to visit."

As we both have goldies (her's is more properly behaved), she decided to give it a test to see how the place would hold up. The place is decently large and we chose an al fresco area (as usual). Space really isn't an issue, but the proximity to the nearby dog run means that your pet's attention will constantly be on the lookout. We thought that we could have a bite with her pet, but unfortunately, Cornerstone isn't a place that serves pets. It's just a restaurant that's pet friendly. Which isn't a bad thing. We've since been back at least once a month to spend some time with her dog (mine is too naughty too sit still), while having coffee and I have to see it's been a great find for us."

The crystal bun has savoury rice filling in it. Tastes not bad.For buns, there is cha siew bun (BBQ pork bun), pan fried pork bun, black sesame bun and everyone's favourite Liu Sha Bao (流沙包). The Liu Sha Bao (流沙包) is uniquely green in color, and the filling really flowing out easily. The black sesame filling in the black sesame bun is a bit too sweet for me.For deep fried items, there is shrimp roll, shrimp dumplings, seafood balls, goyza, and fried durian shrimp roll. The fried durian shrimp roll is covered with deep fried noodle like crust, inside filled with rich and chunky filling. Although one cannot smell the durian in it, the taste is pretty strong in it and surprisely well with the juicy shrimp.Besides these, there is also fried ee fu mee, century egg porridge, lotus leaf rice, chilled pork in jelly, chilled cheek in jelly, baked pork pastry, deep fried fish skin with salted egg and black sesame paste. The deep fried fish skin with salted egg sauce is quite nice with the mayonnaise, although I wish that the salted egg sauce could be thicker. The black sesame paste is quite rich and flavourful. Too bad that is the only hot dessert available that day.For cold desserts, there is ice jelly, almond jelly, herbal jelly and mango jelly. The herbal jelly tastes quite bitter. The ice jelly is quite refreshing with a hint of tea taste.Overall the food is not bad with quite a huge range although mother feels the various is less than the usual dim sum menu. Although there is a lot of staff running around, it is quite difficult to get their attention. Besides the hot tea served on the table, one can also help oneself to the ice lemon tea and ice cubes at the counter. Yes most of the times we seem to be helping ourselves to the various things around. Even when the staff has a push cart full of desserts in front of us and we request that we would like some, the old staff answers that it is not for us, but the tables behind us. Funny especially everyone is having the buffet too. The staffs here seem to be choosy in serving customers. Although at the end of the meal, one feels like having gone through a very fierce battle. Feeling super drain out."

We ordered the prawn roe fried rice and it was really quite good. The different textures of prawn roe, crab meat and the vegetables created quite a stir in my mouth.We orderd the sharks head on the menu as it is quite an uncommon dish. It tasted really good but i felt really guilty for indulging in that dish with all the anti sharks fin campaign going around.The dim sum were good and overall it left me very satisfied. The prices are very reasonable and its alot cheaper than restaurants in town. I will definitely be back to sample the traditional Teochew dishes which I did not manage to taste this round."

We ordered a fair bit and finished all that was placed before us :) Siew Mai is my usual ""standard setter"" for a dim Sum place and they did their quite well. And most of their item came in 3s so it it was just nice for the company that I was with. Both their fried and steams items were good.

The Liu Sha Bow at Swatow seafood comes a close second with its gooey filling just ready to spill out in all its sweet and savory goodness. You NEED to order it if you're here. Swatow Seafood is an unassuming dim sum place away from downtown which means reasonable prices, little to no wait (we had no wait at all on a Saturday afternoon), and the charm of the old school push-cart dim sum experience. This culminates into a very satisfying brunch experience with minimal stress so you can focus on enjoying the food. I thought everything we had was good from the standard siu mais and har gows to the century egg porridge and fried shrimp rolls. And of course end the meal with afore-mentioned Liu Sha Bow. The sweet custard is nicly balanced with the saltiness of the salted egg yolk. Such a treat!They have a buffet for high tea which looked like a great deal but our meal wasn't that much either which makes Sawtow Seafood a good value, and a tasty one at that,"

While the restaurant has not been advertising aggressively nor received the hype over some other star restaurant, it has been well patronised by those in-the-know. On weekends, this place is flooded with people, especially in the morning right up to noon. If you are coming as part of a large group, it is advisable to call ahead and make a reservation.While there has been a shift towards ""high end"" dim sum, i.e. ordering your dishes off a menu, Swatow Seafood still does it the ""old fashion"" way, i.e. service via a push cart. This is a nostalgic experience not to be missed (given that there isn't many such restaurants left). In addition to the old school experience, the dim sum served here is of a high standard comparable with many fine restaurants."

However, we went today and was extremely disappointed. The price for buffet lunch was about $27 including tax. We have 2 hours tome span to eat starting from 3pm to 5pm, however, the food was not out for us until close to 4pm. We will told to pay even before we had food on the table. The varieties were limited, in fact, we were repeatedly asked if we have to eat the same dim sum. I have seated below and air conditioner and it was dripping water on my head. When I told them about it, server just said move your chair slightly to the right. The red been soup was so sweet, is like eating sugar. A lot of their dim sum were not made by kitchen, tasted like either frozen or mass production ordered from suppliers. There were chairs & tables stacked up at the narrow hallway going to toilet. This could be a fire hazard if it by the fire exit door. The elevator was not working at first and had to ask the staff to turn it back on so that my 97 years old dad can get up to restaurant. One waitress just took a plate of dim sum from our table without asking ask just to show the next table that the dish looked like. We were discussing what is their marketing strategy to attract customers. I think they started the dim sum late so we we only have an hour to eat and therefore, won't be able to consume more. And we were provided with limited varieties of dim sum to pick, therefore, we will get sick of the same dim sum with will not consume more. All in all, their strategy is to make more money and providing less, perhaps they are struggling to survive, who knows?!?!? We will not go back there again and will not recommend others to do so. We will also inform friends and relatives who thought they were good like we did, that the standards and quality has dropped. We went there with high expectations and what we got was sub standards in terms of quality, service, quantity and we certainly did not get we deserve with such high price range. I hope the management is made aware of this so that they can work on getting the restaurant back to where it was."

This place used to be Fortunate Restaurant and Lucky Restaurant before that.. so you can say it was a location where weddings and CNY reunion meals were held at when I was young. The only thing that remained the same were the toilet areas and those big curtains where they hide away the spare chairs and tables from public view. I remember playing hide and seek with my cousins there when I was young.. so it was really nostalgic. Anyway back to reviewing the food.. the way the dimsum buffet works is the trolley with piles of food and dimsum will be rolled away. Sounds reasonable but the problem lies with that. As this place is huge.. I personally feel that they are short handed.. so to the two dim sum trolleys that were going around.. it's like there's 30-40 tables waiting.. so sometimes when the trolley comes by.. it's nearly empty.. and the servers sometimes miss our table as we were seated in the middle. We noticed the chances of you getting your plate filled were higher if you were seated at the outside. Food came out one by one.. so we ended up spending a lot of time waiting for the trolleys to come by. Even the drinks were not properly organised.. if we didn't ask we wouldn't have known that we had to go to an area and get the drinks as the dim sum and the fried food were served by trolleys. Servings were depressing.. it's a buffet but the servers usually give us the exact headcount and said that she will come back again later if we should want a second helping since this is a buffet... but often the food runs out and we don't quite see the same food again. Food wise was so-so... I guess I only like the liu sha bao (salted egg yolk custard bun). That's about it.

Not ninth floor. It means a proper Chinese restaurant where big dinners and feasts can be held, especially for weddings.It was also the place of my childhood.Or more accurately, the restaurant that used to be there, formed parts of my childhood. The previous tenant was Xin Fu Lou, which formed memories of piping-hot dim sum pushed around in trolleys.Swatow also has dim sum, but only in the day time and we were there for dinner.  The place was all white covers and folded napkins; sitting there I had an urge to give a $120 ang bao to a man and his wife.The Braised Slice Goose Meat in Teochew Style (~$17) was very savoury, especially the sauce. However the goose portion was too small, beneath the top few slices it was all tofu.The scallops and broccoli ($20) was fresh, but the portion was even smaller. Being hungry gluttons we ordered the oyster omelette ($8) from their Teochew Porridge just in case.Their signature Deep Fried Crispy Pig Trotter (~$25) is a must-try. The skin looked dark and the meat looked dark but it was GOOD. The skin was crispy and crunchy and yet easy on the bite. You know some crispy pork skin fried too hard until it tastes bitter and has so hard a centre it feels like biting on rocks? Not this. The meat was tender and flavourful. If you can only afford one dish, THIS IS IT. (Yes their dishes are pretty expensive IMO.)The oysters in the oyster omelette were huge and easy for me to pick out (I don't eat oysters) to give to my family members. The rest of it wasn't as starchy and gooey as I'd liked.A set of tea came with our dessert to clear our throats. I voiced out loud thinking it was syrup meant to be poured over the yam paste, asking why it wasn't poured. The affable head waiter corrected me, so yes, please don't embarrass yourself like me.I must also mention that Swatow refers to the Teochew province of China, and my heritage-proud father has claimed the food at Swatow to be quite authentically Teochew.Overall I feel the food is standard fare, and is overpriced; Swatow is evidently no Xin Fu Lou. I've heard good reviews about their dim sum buffets though."

Everything here is vegan, which is awesome. Staff is super friendly and they let me kick back and read a book at one of their comfy chairs long after I'd finished my ice cream.Even if you're just visiting Singapore as a tourist, if you're vegan or vegetarian or not able to eat dairy, it's definitely worth hopping on public transport to reach the Sin Ming Road area just to try this place.

Service was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. It was noisy with conversation as the small space was full on a Sunday afternoon. The heartbreaker for me was when I went to pay and found out they only take cash and NETS! I wish this had been noted on the door or menu - typically when dining at expensive brick-and-mortar places, I assume Visa and Mastercard will be accepted, saving me the trip to an ATM for cash withdrawal. Given that they're actually producing tasty, healthy vegan food with gluten-free options, I'm still giving it four stars, but for me personally, not accepting credit cards is a dealbreaker. The location is a bit off the beaten path. Still, if you have a NETS card or are not cash-averse, Wellsmoocht is worth checking out!"

Guilt-free ice cream at it's best. Even though it's dairy-free, you should note that the ice cream does not taste icy at all, though it also lacks the creamy taste, Brownice ice cream still holds the smooth textures.The 4 scoops of ice cream we picked were :CoconutHazelnutMatchaPeanut ButterIt might sound like alot of flavours, but they all went well together. First off, if this is your first visit to Brownice, definitely go for the coconut! There's real coconut fruit embedded in the ice cream! It is slightly creamy, with authentic coconut taste and sweetness. It goes really well with the chocolate syrup topping.The matcha wasn't too bitter, and the sweetness level was just right for me. I don't like matcha ice creams that taste too sweet or artificial. Over here, the matcha was closer to the grainy texture, as unlike the coconut, the matcha wasn't able to have a smooth aftertaste. Nevertheless, probably the best guilt-free and vegan matcha you can taste in Singapore! The peanut butter was too sweet for my liking, but you could taste real peanut butter embedded into the ice cream. Think of chunky monkey from ben and jerrys. Lots of peanuts too, that adds a crunchy bite in every scoop!The hazelnut was almost like eating nutella ice cream! It was a tad sweet, and I probably wouldn't finish a whole scoop by myself, but give me a scoop of coconut or matcha, and it will magically disappear with a spoon in my hand.The waffle here is of a crispy consistency. I would say, this is one of my most favourite waffle places in Singapore. Despite the waffle not having any fragrance or aroma. The light, airy and yet biscuit like edges makes this waffle so addictive.Overall :  A great place to get vegan ice cream, even if you're not a vegan, or trying to stay on a healthy diet. The ice creams here are great, and so are their waffles. There's free wifi too! Definitely download the Entertainer App before heading down to Brownice!"

Ice cream without dairy? Me no likey! It sounded like a guaranteed one star review to me. But in the whole spirit of being open to others people opinions and tastes I tagged along, expecting to go to have a nice juicy burger and shake on my way back home. WRONG!!! This place is great and I liked the food a lot.Their pizza menu is quite extensive (much more options than the picture posted in a precious review) and since it was the four of us, we tried out 4 different ones and all of them were delicious, no kidding! Honestly, I really enjoyed it and I did not miss meat or cheese at all... Miracles do exist apparently!The crust of the pizza is the really thin and crispy and the toppings taste really fresh and unique...I really loved the ones with the monkey head mushrooms and as with regular pizza I especially enjoyed the ones with extra spice on it. In fact, the staff was nice enough to substitute and remove toppings to tailor my own personal pizza.I was not hungry anymore after all that pizza goodness but my friends wanted dessert and I by then, I was curious enough to taste the waffle and ice cream.

So cute.Coconut-Gula Melaka ""Egg"" ($5.50/ mini)Coconut and gula melaka ice cream on digestive biscuit base. Delightly refreshing pairing.The ice cream is smooth with bits of the coconut flesh in it. It would be better if the flavour of the gula melaka has been stronger. The biscuit base gives it a slightly salty taste. Unique combination of the sweet and salty.Pure Hazelnut Bomb ($5.50/mini)Thick layer of hazenut ice cream on a fruit and nut chocolate base.The ice cream is very smooth and rich which kind of reminds me of peanut butter.

However, this place stands out so nicely because its 100% vegan, and they don't use processed/refined sugar, only a small amount unrefined cane sugar in their waffles and cane juice in their ice cream. I asked :) Even their waffles are vegan, using no eggs or cows milk, and yet it was still delicious. I had 2 scoops of ice cream and a waffle, and by the end of finishing everything, I wasn't like super full or bloated, but I was definitely satisfied. Less guilt, and totally satisfied. That's a pretty good feeling coming out of an ice cream shop. The service is also THE NICEST I have come across in Singapore, shocking to say since this is an ice cream shop. All smiles and super sweet. They also serve free flow alkaline water with a high ph. I don't know any other ice cream shop, let alone restaurant that serves free flow alkaline water. Do you?!"

After all, unrefined sugar, nuts and brown rice are still usedTexture-wise, the ice-cream (two scoops for is not as smooth as most ice cream parlours including below320nitro. Luckily, both the Madagascar Vanilla and Cookies & Cream were not too sweet. Not too sure if coconut milk was used but there was an odd coconut aroma which lingers on.Don't mistake, I love coconut but perhaps I'll save it for other desserts.Constructed of French Chocolate, Hazelnut Chocolate ice cream and a raw crust, the tri-layer mudpie $9.80 refused to budge despite being left in room temperature for 20min. The ice cream flavours were more tolerable than the individual scoops earlier, and lovely contrasted with the salty biscuit base. The original toppings of caramelized salt almonds which ran out of stock, was a sign that they are likely to be tastier than our chocolate chips and granola. Due to the ingredients, the price of Brownice's vegan ice cream is not very nice. But perhaps its a good investment for our health."

I like bananas, so I got the banana oats then and found that the oats complemented the bananas pretty well. When my friends and I chanced upon this store, we got the ice-cream bowl to share. It consisted of four scoops of any ice-cream flavours and four toppings of our choice and only cost $12.50. It wasn't a bad deal - we sampled more flavours and the toppings gave us good value for money. The crunchy walnuts, plump raisins, tangy cranberries and caramelised almonds added more oomph to our dessert.

Well, these pictures represented exactly what we received! This is a perfect place for any ""true"" fan. Yes I say true because I have read reviews on here where they say that their friend didn't realize it was a HP café. How are you a true fan and not notice this? Seriously!!!! From the menu, to the decorations, to the photo area, it all screams Harry Potter!!!!!  If you want to order the Hagrid's Afternoon Tea, keep in mind that it starts at 2pm and it's in limited quantities. Also, come with an appetite as it is a lot of food for 2 people. At least I think it's a lot of food. My husband had the seafood menu items, and he said they tasted really good. I had the non-seafood menu items and it was so delicious! All the desserts were amazing! Though I did order some coffee to counteract the sweetness of the desserts.

It was the coolest thing I've ever done. It was particularly of course my favorite part in the restaurant. The drink itself was good and let me tell you that it's an alcoholic drink. We ordered a lot of desserts since we ate from one of the hawk centers there. The food we got was why this place is only a three stars for me. I took out two because it was just not very good. I had so much expectations. I wanted it to be as magical in my mouth with the expensive price point. For one dish it was like $15-16 and so I was hoping it would be worth it. But it's not.

I was a little dismayed that they put lemon in it, as I personally do not like lemon at all, but it was still very good. The sauce was so creamy, and the plating was beautiful, as it was for the other meals. We also had a piece of chocolate cake that was amazing - it was rich, decadent, and moist. I split the cake with a friend, which was definitely a good idea because the food is quite filling here. One of my friends ordered Mr Lich's Flaming Brew, which was an alcoholic drink that they light on fire by sprinkling what I think was cinnamon onto it.

For a theme cafe, the staffs are extremely low energy. Not interested at all to sell their products or make this a great experience."

Harry Potter's movie soundtrack is playing in the background, the walls are adorned with decor from the wizarding world, and the cleanliness is excellent. The menu is pretty good at providing an assortment of options; quinoa salad, crab pasta, duck, truffle fries, gorgeous desserts, and fun drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). I can definitely feel the Harry Potter vibe in the menu selection, and I glad they didn't make it exactly like in the movies, I want food that I am actually able to eat lol. I love this place, and if I wasn't just here on vacation, I would be coming back here regularly!"
