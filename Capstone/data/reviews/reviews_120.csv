The food is good overall, but certain dishes definitely stand out more than the others. Signature dishes are their egg caviar and truffle pizza, but the Crispy Chicken and Lamb were also good options."

The food is good, but nothing to scream about. Worse, the short menu has not changed for well over a year. Two out of four meat main dishes are deep fried. Service is friendly and polite, but mechanical. This is not a place where you can engage in a conversation with the staff. At $100-120 per pax, you are paying for the brand and the décor. I am not returning until the menu changes. For French/western at Dempsey, atout is more satisfying, and there are many other options too."

Closed on some days but really busy when it's open. Try to get there before 12, otherwise there's usually a line, a line that sometimes run beyond the the edge of the hawker center. The soup is so delicious and rich, and it's really spicy, so be prepared and ask for no Chilli if you can't take spicy. The prawns are peeled, so I love it,  it's so easy to eat! The tau Kwa is soaked in the soup for hours and is so tasty and amazing texture! I love it. If you're a fan of chicken, you can add shredded chicken too. There is $3, $5 or $8; the $3 bowl is really small, like for kids, but great if you're not too hungry. Uncle is so friendly and energetic. He has this signature move where he swirls the soup pot and gets the essence mixed before filling up your bowl. I also love the fat Mee fun, very nice and slurpy. Definitely come visit early!

Came here around noon on a Friday and it was not crowded as I thought it might. It is located near to other restaurants so there might have competitiveness within their food industry business. I have been to this restaurant for more than 10 years so I know what's good here.Ordered a few dishes: 1. coffee flavored pork ribs, 2. cold jelly pig feet, 3. Steamed Teochew Pomfret, 4. Spinach / ""Nai Pai"" in Supreme Broth, 5. Butter & Cereal Crayfish  and dessert: Pumpkin Yam Paste aka ""Orh Ni"". I will list the reviews according to the numbers.1. The coffee flavored pork ribs wasn't as good as it used to be. The meat was harder to chew and the coffee was not as strong as it used to be.2. This is my first time trying this dish and it was good. Right chewiness and the taste was just right.3. Dislike steam fish so I didn't end up eating it but my family members did.4. It was so-so. What to expect? But they don't have the thousand years egg in them anymore.5. It was less salty than it used to be - Excellent for me! I love mixing the crumbs with my rice so I took spoonfuls of those and put it on top of my rice. The crayfish was good and chewy. Still love this dish :)And... Dessert, unfortunately it isn't that good as it used to be. But I still enjoy my bowl of Orh Ni.This restaurant is pretty spacious. It has plenty of seats and big tables - good for family dining. But I believe that the design is too white washed. Will definitely be back for more crayfish in the upcoming weeks. Parking: either on the streets (parallel) or the HDB parking."

The chicken tikka platter leaves a rainbow of flavors on your tastebuds. The bryiani is bad. Even if you order one, make sure to mix your dish before serving cause all the curry is at the bottom of the kadai.

I must admit it is not an easy task to travel all the way into Wessex Village square as it is quite remote from the public transport system and even if one is driving, we have to go through some narrow roads.One thing that I is worth the travel is the nostalgic feel that really gave us the feel that we were back into the past. Walking deeper into the pavement, I felt that as though there was a tweak in the time machine, bringing us into 60s, 70s and all we saw was some foldable wooden shop doors with the rustic looking signboard. Not only that, as we entered into the cafe, we were welcome by this old school analog weighing scale.Over at the counter, you will notice a road sign with ""Jalan Hang Jebat"". That was actually its original location before moving to witchurch road.Even the menu looked so old school.Forget about air conditioned dining as Colbar offers dining just like time had stopped back in the 70s where such cool environments are still not so common.With the drinks accompanying the meal, I find that the amount was relatively on the high side given the pricing.Lime Juice - $4 & Strawberry Milkshake - $5.50 They serve good breakfast items. Even though we were having dinner, we decided to order sides like Tomato Omette for sharing. Egg was fluffy with slices of tomato.Pork Cutlet was lean and easy on the jaws with mushroom gravy that was on a salty side. However, such style of preparation are lesser seen in the Western Food Serving nowadays and I totally enjoy having this ""home-style"" cuisine.Pork Chop, Chips & Mushroom - $11Food tasted nothing extra ordinary but such food combination was nothing like what we had outside. Besides the chips, the chicken cutlet comes with a sunny side egg and Goreng Pisang (Fried Banana) which we thought was rather unusual.Chicken Maryland - $16.50Having dine in a peaceful with laidback environment,  I don't mind coming back again to escape myself from the city lives."

Once u reach though, it's a pretty neat place.Colbar or Colonial Bar is nestled amidst lush greenery - and not the artificial-looking, neat rows of plants. It kinda looks like something you stumble upon while trekking through the jungle. That said, it was pleasantly cool when I was there last evening thanks to the afternoon shower; I would think it might get a little humid on other nights. The high barn-like ceiling and large concrete floor space makes you feel like you immediately stepped back 60 years into the past where space was not an issue for restaurant owners. And they've cleverly kept the authentic ""kampung"" ambience with the blue-paint wood plank panels and kopitiam tables and chairs (love it!). It's actually a really old restaurant (thanks to my know-it-all boyfriend) and kudos to them for keeping it this way because the expats living in the area obviously love it. It was crowded even on a Tuesday night!OK menu - personally I preferred the Chinese food. Served piping hot, the horfun and stir-fried veg with garlic we had was better than your average zichar stall in the heartlands. The fish n chips was kinda 'meh' - nice chunks of potato but the fish was dry. Pork chop was alright too. The range of craft beer is supposedly impressive (didn't drink cuz working on my summer body). The great thing is you don't need to worry about being too noisy in the middle of the jungle.All in all a good place to chill with old friends, or with your german shepherd (they're pretty dog-friendly from what we saw).

It was originally a bar for British soldiers half a century ago when Singapore was still a colony (hence the name).Location wise- difficult to get to without a ride (though not impossible). Decor- distinctive blue building with very simple, practical details, none of your carefully sourced vintage kitsch here. A bit too practical, felt even more run down than the hawker center opposite my house (but I suppose that's part of its authenticity).Food- surprisingly expensive (was not expecting $20-$30 meals here) though came in a good-sized portion. However, the taste left much to be desired. The ribeye steak I had was fine (but quite salty) but my dining companion commented that his mom could make a better version (yes he's biased, no she's not a chef).

This is probably the most laid back hippie bar, old school Colonial style, in Singapore.Colbar, or Colonial Bar as it is officially known, was the canteen and unofficial mess for the old British army troops while it was still at Jalan Hang Jebat. The whole bar was literally dismantled part-by-part, and all the tiles, timber screens and swing doors were used for the reconstruction of the new Colbar. I'm glad they did all they could to preserve this bit of history. Simple and old furnishing- Formica tabletops, mini pale green tiles, faded old photographs on frames. Love the air of nostalgia and days long gone. I wish i could travel back in time..Basic Western and Asian fare is served here. The cooking isn't great but really, who goes to a bar for food? The highlight here is the impossible selection of imported beers and ciders (mostly English and Irish). Beer lovers rejoice! I saw my favorite Brothers Toffee Apple Cider here. Oh yea.The outdoor area is very open and i love how it's surrounded by an oasis of green. Listen to the birds and crickets sing in the background and occasional tune from the arty group next table (highly possible considering the crowd) while enjoying your happy juice. Cheers!

A tiny drawback is the location though, being tucked away in a largely upscale private residential neighbourhood with only one direct bus service (191).

The spacious outdoor sitting area makes it a very suitable chill out zone to catch up with a large group of friends, and tables can be moved around freely with the owners consent. The food, while reasonably priced, comes in a fairly small portion, so it might be wise to order some sides to make up for it.

The bread was even starting to get wet from the juice of the beef which was quite a turn off. And it was served on a side plate, the plastic kind you get at the coffee shop for you soft boil eggs.

Sometimes you just need a PIZZA. But where can a guy from NYC possibly find a good pizza in a place like Singapore? Look no further than Ristorante Pietrasanta.These guys could give the pizza from Brooklyn a run for its money. The pizza here is amazing. I can only vouch for the one pie I ordered, but it will be a lasting memory until I head back to Singapore a few months from now. Let it be known that I am a black truffle whore. I can't get enough of these magical bits of heaven. And here they make a Tartufo Nero pizza -- essentially a white pie with black truffle pesto and truffle oil. To say it is delectably rich would be an understatement. It is among the best things I  have ever eaten. It was almost a shame that I preceded it with a giant arugula salad, as it took up room in my stomach where another slice of pizza could have fit. The greens were super fresh, but I didn't love the texture of the sun-dried tomatoes, and the lemon and Parmigiano-Reggiano dressing was too light to hold up against the bitter, peppery arugula. My wife, however, would love have loved this salad. Next time I come here I will not dine alone and will bring others so we can try more of the food. The burrata and the pasta dishes I saw walking by me all looked amazing. It's so nice to know you can come to Asia and find real authentic Italian food. Hats off to Giuseppe and Chef Loris -- you guys are awesome!"

For mains, my boss had pappardelle ragu while our counterparts and myself enjoyed the lobster pasta, which was a daily special. There was a generous serving of lobster and the pasta was done al dente, which worked for me.

The service crew treated us friendly, and the wine cellar was nicely done. But that's where the good stuff ends. As the night drew on, more customers started coming in and the tight interior of the restaurant became very evident. Waiters had to constantly squeeze past each other and customers that stood up, and got less helpful and more grumpy as the night went on. Our food took almost a full hour to come from the time we ordered, and when it finally came, the quality wasn't all that good. The right space meant it was extremely difficult and disruptive for any one person to get up and go to the toilet, which was of the same quality as a hawker centre toilet.Then we had our birthday celebration, which required the cake we kept in the fridge earlier to be taken out and served. This took a good 15 minutes. Also, when we wanted to ask a waiter to take a photo for our group, there was none in sight. When he did agree to do so, he took another 5 minutes to get ready. Finally, we tallied the bill, which came up to $70+ per person. In summary, come here only if you're in a group of not more than 4, have a lot of time, and a car.

They confirmed the day before by sms. We got indoor seating as the heat these days is just horrendous. Everyone gets a little shot glass of tomato sauce to dip the bread. Warning the foccacia is more like their pizza crust with herbs on and it costs about $7.50 a basket. Worth getting though.They offered us sparkling or iced or warm water so it's nice they didn't try to push only bottled water.Vibe of the restaurant was buzzy, noisy, lots of chatting..family style communal sharing was welcome. Bear in mind..Friday night.Highlight of the meal was the daily special..Burrata for $40. Big round pouch of burrata..it was heavenly creamy so fresh and so tasty. Totally worth it and they brought a special bottle of olive oil to eat with it. Yummy thick dark yellow one. It went great on our 2nd basket of foccacia.We all agreed the seafood soup was a good buy for about $14 (can't rem too busy eating), the server very readily volunteered to split all the seafood soups into 2 portions for us to share.Nice surprise, the pastas and pizzas were rather affordable! A lot of pizzas were about $20 or less. We only had one..a ham and mushroom. It's not the super thin crispy type but I actually prefer one with a bit of a chew although not hard rather than a crunch biscuit with not much flavour. The crust is fatter because of the long slow rise with lots of air pockets, outside has a nice thin crisp bite and inside is soft chewy and light. Tasty! The part with the toppings is thin enough that it was bending under the generous amount of ham.Pastas again more affordable than I expected. Mostly freshly made...that's always something I appreciate! And while the flavours were fresh and the ingredients quite generous, seasoning was well controlled to highlight the taste of the ingredients and not to disguise shortfalls. we didn't get that too salty feeling that is quite common in a lot of Italian places.The squid ink with crab meat is quite a popular dish I was told. It's not what I expected but I will order again. It was surprisingly light compared to a lot of renditions out there with a fresh tomato sauce.We also tried a daily special pasta which was cream based with ham. I wouldn't have picked this coz I didn't want more ham but it was a saltier richer dish. I was eyeing the risotto with porcini or the gnocchi with blue cheese (woo next time!).Then we followed up with the 1kg T-bone steak (my mom wanted steak but we were a bit out of ideas so I asked her to try this place. None of my family had been before but I had). This wasn't as good as when I last had it. I had asked for medium as my mom doesn't like it too bloody but it was more like medium well and a bit dry. The meat that came right off the bone part was so juicy though. I think I'll rather try the lamb dishes the next time and have more pastas and pizzas.Service was very on the ball, not intrusive but responsive. We also went into the wine room to choose our wine. Prices all marked out clearly with many having tasting notes written on a label, was quite a fun experience. We were told to help ourselves..no pressure :)Note they highly recommend this dark chocolate ""cake"" that they buy from Italy..but for the price..13.90 for a tiny little piece. Save your money..go to Royce. Get a box of their powdered signature chocolate (I think around $20) much bigger portion and similar style and you can choose some flavours. We thought the tiramisu was ok only, quite a big piece. We also had the lemon meringue, the meringue texture was very creamy and the lemon is quite tangy so I like that. The pastry was ok, not very special. Definitely a better portion size than the choc thing.Not everything was fantastic but it's a good solid choice for pizzas, pastas and starters. Service is good. Atmosphere is relaxed and prices surprisingly affordable (without wine), I can see myself coming more regularly for dinner. I'm a bit stuck between 4 and 5 but currently stick to 4."

It holds much authenticity with homemade focaccia bread, cheeses, and pastas. They are all very fresh and simple. I really enjoy the setting and hospitality. Everyone is so friendly and always smiling. The food was without a doubt pleasing. We had the house special mackerel, lasagna and a starter. It was enough to keep us full but we persisted till dessert came. The fish was sweetly grilled and very fresh. It was as if they fish it out from the sea instead of flying it in from Norway. The lasagna is cheesy but yet hold substantial meatiness and well seasoned. A dark chocolate torte with sour cream and biscotti, much like a match made in heaven. I would definitely come back again to try their wine and homemade pastas."

The dark chocolate cake was so thin it is seriously should be described as a tart.

From authentic thin crust pizzas to truffle infused pastas, this place has it all. Despite the menu sounding like a mad overkill, each and every dish is truly authentic and well thought out. My two personal favourites to share are the 1KG T-bone steak and the Neploitana Pizza. The T-bone steak is grilled to perfection according to your request although the chef's recommendation is medium to medium-rare. This main is accompanied with well-seasoned grilled potatoes, tossed beans and a generous bowl of olive-balsamic rocket salad. Perfect for sharing between 2 - 4 people depending on how huge your appetite is. The Nepolitana pizza highlights authentic Italian pizza at its best with a thin layer of mozzarella, anchovy fillets and capers.  If you're a die-hard Stuffed Crust Pizza Hut fan, this pizza might not be for you.  Finally if you're a cheese lover, you're in luck. Pietrasanta stocks a huge collection of imported cheeses sure to impress even the most experienced cheese connoisseurs. One final point to note, make your reservations early especially over the weekends. Viva Italia!"

This was one of them. Its labeled as an asian tapas restaurant but has a little more of a bar feel. Not that its a bad thing. It has nice atmosphere, dark lighting but well decorated. Theres a number of bird cages spread around almost as lanterns.  Its definitely a nice spot to chill and relax.The menus itself isnt huge but pretty much everything we had was GREAT.  I loved the chili crab dip with mantou buns.  The truffle fries are good but its pretty hard to mess up truffle fries.  The peking duck wraps were awesome.  They had small burgers like spicy thai burger, tandori chicken burger and vietnamese pork burger which were all good.  There was a few standard items which were good but didnt wow me like mango salad and shrimp wantons.  Overall I'd say the food was great and reasonably priced.  We had a LOTS of food and a drink each and it came out to about $40 per person. The staff was attentive and friendly.   Another plus is that their happy hour goes until 9pm. I'll definitely be coming back."

Not only is the name cute, but the whole café is just a joy to dine in.  My bestie Ginny and I enjoyed a relaxing brunch at this beautiful café, and I must confess I was in love.The Place:  PS Café opened up in 1999 as a cozy café hidden within Projectshop clothing store in Singapore.  It's what one would imagine when thinking of Sunday brunches and lazy afternoon teas and has since opened up several branches and become a popular choice for locals and Expats alike.  The one that I went to is just a little hidden and off the beaten path within Dempsey (i.e. hipper and prettier version of Orchard).  It's this little white, glass house nestled in beautiful greenery.   You can't help but smile when you see it.  White brick walls and dark wooden floors welcomes you as you step into the restaurant.  Weather permitting, I highly recommend you get a table on the patio, where you can just stare into the beautiful surrounding. The Food: So, beautiful and hip ....does equal pricey menu.  Not going to lie, PS Café is on the pricier side in terms of brunches, for the both of us brunch came out to be approx.. $80!  Ginny and I both had their special ""Portobello Mushrooms, Poached Eggs, and Asparagus"" which set us back $24 each (buuuuuuut it was super delicious), fresh orange juice $9.50 x 2, and coffee $4.00 x 2.  In addition to the menu items, there is also a large display of baked goods, ranging from muffins to carrot cake....mmmmmmm!  We both really enjoyed our time and our meal there - but maybe not an everyday place for me (would have given it 4 stars if it was a bit less). Tip: They are famous for their fries! I didn't try them as I was too full but next time, I'll be sure to try their Truffle Fries ($15).  If you guys try it, let me know how it goes."

However, the most beautiful architecture does not help when the main purpose of a place does not live up to its premise.We arrived late Sunday afternoon for tea and drinks and had to wait for some time to order. The guy seemed funny at first but then pulled a face at my husbands order of a Negroni and a salad. Sounds strange but I was there..When our drinks and food arrived, my husband had to get rid of around 10 ice cubes from his drink, reducing the (very watery and non-Negroni tasting) cocktail to a shot.My Bloody Mary was ok but for the price I was expecting a highball size, at least, and not a water glass.To cut the whole story short, we stayed longer, enjoyed the view and the quiet, but the service (we had 5 different people over the course of our stay attending to us, extremely slow, kept forgetting orders etc.) would've made me leave otherwise.I wanted to love it, but the extortionate bill does not match the service provided or the ""OK"" food - not to mention the inconsistency with drinks."

That was the BEST dessert to EVER hit my tongue. I can't believe it. It was hot, moist, just the right density, the sauce was perfectly caramelly with just a little saltiness, and the vanilla bean icecream completed the whole thing. Like, man. That was so good. Two things to know before dining here: if it's busy, you might wait 40+mins for food, and if you're sitting outside, bring mosquito repellent. There's not many bugs out there, but if you're like me and happen to be a walking Mozzie Buffet, sitting right by the jungle can be an....er, interesting experience. HOWEVER. The food here is great! I absolutely LOVED their Pad Thai Salad - the prawns were tender and well cleaned, the veggies were fresh and crunchy, and the peanut sauce and flavourful spices were delicious. 10/10 would order again. I also loved their ranges of Gin - the subtle tastes and flavours were really fun to explore. Tried the truffle fries and honestly don't have too much to say. They were pretty average, and the first batch we had to send back to the kitchen because they were stone cold :/ the hot ones were nice enough, but I wouldn't order them again. Also, I've already raved about their Sticky Date, but we also grabbed PS's specialty brownie...which actually wasn't that great, to be honest! It looks FASCINATING, stacked a mile high with huge fluffy marshmallows and covered with ganache, but the brownie itself was more the consistency of a sponge, and it was sickeningly sweet. Even the ice cream wasn't enough of a break between the hectic chocolate gooeyness, so we all ended up going cross-eyed from sugar overload and only eating 1/4 of the slice all up. Considering the calibre of the other meals we ordered, this one was a bit of a disappointment. Service: 4/5 starsFood: 4/5 stars overallAtmosphere: 5/5 starsSpeed: 1.5/5 stars on a busy day."

I wasn't a huge fan of the burger as I felt like it was a little bland. The fries that came with the burger, however, were thickly cut and wonderful! They came with a mayo dip that seemed to be infused with a zesty taste and some herb that I couldn't quite identify. In short, it was wonderful.The truffle fries and pudding were, as always, sinful goodness. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to visit the cafe. The atmosphere was great, as always, but service was slow. We came before the peak dining period but still faced issues with having our water refilled in a timely fashion.

And the best part is how a lot of the greenery was kept as it was and isn't some pruned garden that they created around the restaurant. It makes for a lovely afternoon visit so you can enjoy being surrounded by nature."

Oh, the smell of truffle fries wants me to come back...Overall score: 4.2/5 - will return. Great for tea.---Atmosphere---PS Cafe on 28B Harding Road isn't easy to find unless you know what you're looking for, but when you do find it, you'll realize why. The entrance is to the ""back"" of the establishment if you're coming from Dempsey Hill, and is located on Harding Road on the way to the White Rabbit. It's sunk low into the ground, on a hill.The interior decor is astounding, and it clearly reflects its founders' taste in fashion and design (did you know that PS Cafe stands for Project Shop Cafe, for back when it was a cafe attached to a fashion goods store?) A tall ceiling combined with floor-to-ceiling glass partitions keeps the venue air-conditioned and cool while maintaining the feel that you're still sitting in a cafe in the middle of a rainforest. While the view looks down the hill at the side of a clump of trees/the forest, it actually adds to the experience as the wood is mirrored in the construction of PS Cafe.Chalkboards subtly hint at menu options in discreet locations, while the volume stays at a level where you're not afraid to talk above a whisper, but neither are you struggling to hear what your buddies are talking about.Score: 4.5/5---Food/Drinks---My buddy and I split a slice of the Golden Banana Butterscotch Cake. Originally, I thought we were going to order our own slices, but then he pointed out how big they were. They're quite sizable, and for tea or dessert, one is perfectly fine for two people to share. It wasn't overly dry nor wet, and the taste of banana was subtle and not overbearing. It was accompanied by ice cream, which complimented it perfectly. For the price you're paying, it was well worth it.I had a Grapefruit Lychee Caipiroska, which I thought was splendid and refreshing for the hot day that it was. A little too much ice for my liking, but it came with sliced grapefruit and lychees floating inside, a touch of effort which I greatly appreciate in a drink. Flavorful and yummy, took the edge off of the vodka that was used, which was perfect.I will add a caveat that this place has me wanting to come back after seeing my friend's coffee affogato and smelling the truffle fries from the table next to ours.Score: 4/5---Service---Polite and friendly would be how I would describe service. Despite ordering maybe two drinks and one food dish, the servers let us continue to sit for about two hours, even though the first sitting for dinner was already filtering in and being served (I felt woefully underdressed in my shorts at this point in time, lol).Score: 4/5---Miscellaneous---Nothing to say here that I haven't already said.Score: nil/5"

If being seen while you have your coffee and cake is important, then THIS is the place.Service - The waiters are generally more pleasant and attentive. The hostess had an incredible dismissive and disdainful attitude. She actually made me feel bad for trying to spend money at her place of employment. Too bad I was too lazy to find another place to eat. Damn my lack of principles! And I found such a nice sheltered parking lot, too.Food - Truffle fries - Meh. Shepard's pie - salty, other assorted mains, too uneventful to remember. Reuben sandwich (see pic) sad and wilted.Desserts - Cakes are huge. But expensive. So share if you must. Cakes are on the dry side. And had a dense sponge texture. Like a kitchen sink sponge. Not that I have tasted one. (That's my story I'm sticking to it.)Price - The price of starters and entrees are stupidly expensive. I mean, seriously ridiculous.  $8 for a coke, go figure. $28 to $40 for entrees. Desserts are about $18. Wha-what?Final note: I come here at most once a year. Only because I work 5 minutes away, and its a nice place to bring overseas colleagues to impress them. I am shallow that way. But beyond that, there are a million other places with better food and better service."

I had the special, which was crab cakes and poached eggs (I think - it's been awhile). The food was awesome and so was the long black coffee. They brought us a dish of honey for our coffee that was awesome - thick, gooey, and not overly sweet. Not a big deal to most, but I take my coffee pretty seriously! :) Hubby ordered the shepherd's pie, which was good, but not what he expected. It's a bit different than the American version because it has ground beef prepared similar to spaghetti sauce inside of it. The views were gorgeous and we were very pleased.Our second trip was for dinner last night. We sat outside and I started out with the Pimm's Cooler, which is my favorite drink in all of Singapore thus far. I ordered the burger, hold the cheese and the bun and he got the chicken parm, hold the cheese and croutons. Totally hit the spot, and our server did a great job delivering our order - I know we can be a pain trying to make dishes work for Paleo. This place is definitely our speed and we'll be back again and again."

The food is however nothing special, I have had some of the brunch dishes such as as the pad thai and the 'leftover' lasagna. The pad thai is decent but considering that there are a lot of Thai restaurants in Singapore I would say that one can get it cheaper and better elsewhere. The lasagna is nice but not something to base a visit on.What I mostly like to do here is actually just have a drink and enjoy the environment. If it is busy they will most likely want you to eat something and my experience that most things are decent but nothing is outstanding or surprising. I do still not necessarily think that it is bad thing, I do sometimes not seek the new or exciting thing and then this can very well do."

The hollandaise sauce was good, not a easy task. The service was good, attentive while still allowing us to enjoy the table.

(I have only been impressed with one dessert in Singapore, but I think PS.Cafe has what it takes to get the desserts on the map.) Frosting on M's Carrot Cake, though perfect in taste and texture, is not enough in quantity given the size of the slice. It needs layers of frosting throughout to take it to the next level. Dark Chocolate Banana Cheesecake had a suggestion of dark chocolate on the top. When the first words are ""dark chocolate"" I am looking for dark chocolate and this was Banana Cheesecake, though again the flavor was excellent and the texture was heavenly.Flourless Orange Cake with orange butterscotch sauce was delicious.

There are several reasons why I might brag about it, firstly its free, secondly its just by the road so its only a short distance walk, thirdly its a change from all the systematic parking you'll find in Singapore.

Although pricey, it is a lovely place to go for a special night out or a date - and the food is surprisingly good!  The portions are big, and the ribs that I had were drop off the bone fantastic - even better than the ones at Lawry's the Prime Rib! The meat was soooo succulent and easy to take off the bone, and the coleslaw and fried onions that accompanied it were executed just as well.The fries ($12) are huge, thus explaining the price. You could happily share a plate between 4 people - but it smelt so strongly of bottled truffle oil that it really took the flavour of the fries themselves away. Think it would have been better served salted and with sweet chilli and aioli. All in all a very good experience, will be going back again!"

While not entirely unfair, I do feel that there's a consistency that is worthy of appreciation.Of all the branches, this is my favourite for a casual night out. Nestled amidst lush greenery, when you sit outdoors it's almost possible to forget you're still in Singapore. Almost no roads in sight, just vegetation, it's a nice place to spend the evening, or even an afternoon. The food and drink are, to me, are more than satisfactory. I love their house salad, a mixed green salad livened up by blueberries, sunflower seeds, and a delicious pomegranate dressing. Very addictive. I also thoroughly enjoy their mud crab pasta. While I usually don't order crab because I'm lazy to work for my food, the flavour of the crab blends very well with the sauce, and I order it almost every time I go. They have a great mushroom soup, though I forget exactly what they call it, and an excellent selection of cocktails. Their truffle fries are also a big hit, though the lactose intolerant should be aware that theirs come served with cheese. When I first heard of PS.Cafe though, it was for their cakes and desserts. The Chocolate Blackout is IMMENSE, and I refuse to believe anyone can finish it alone. Their puddings are really good, though I found their key lime pie just 'okay'. Overall it's a little pricey to be a regular fixture on my weekly schedule, but a great place to head to when you want to meet up with friends you haven't seen in forever. It can be a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights though, so if you're hoping for long intense conversations... it's not always ideal."

It's a nice spot to come for a good cocktail and a nice meal out on the patio. Brunches are a zoo. Seriously, it's like Disneyland on New Years if you come on a Sunday. The brunch food is pretty good though I've occasionally had some very sketchy [read: raw whites] eggs. Now this happens a lot around town so even in high end places I've kinda given up on my old friend eggs benny. Desserts are to die for. The carrot cake is my current crush but I also had a brief entanglement with the ginger toffee cake that could have got serious. Don't miss dessert even if you have to take it to-go."

Unless you don't mind the walk through dempsey down to holland road to take the bus. It's a really romantic atmosphere if you're walking in here in the evening, the pathway is lined with candles before you enter the bustling cafe. It's usually full of people, you'd be lucky to get a table on weekends without making a reservation. I've been here for dinner once, I found the food too average for the price (or maybe I didn't order the right stuff). Had the chicken parmiggiano and truffle fries. The chicken was a little bland and the fries, while served in a generously hefty portion, significantly lacked the truffle flavour, it almost feels like they forgot the truffle somehow. I like the touch of parmesan cheese on top but could do with more cheese!I've also been here for a tea break. My friend and I were on a pie hunt and PS cafe have some really good pies. Their display of desserts will have you salivating! I had the key lime pie while my friend had the chocolate walnut pie. The key lime pie was an absolute delight of citrus burst in your mouth, so refreshingly good! I just didn't like whip cream on top of it that had some coconut sprinkles, I'll be sure to tell them to skip that the next time I order it, the pie is fine on its own. The walnut pie was really rich, we couldn't finish it!Final verdict: Come here for a nice date night or if you live nearby otherwise there are other more accessible PS Cafes in town but definitely DO NOT miss out on the key lime pie! Oh but not all outlets serve the key lime pie though, the one at Ann Siang for one, doesn't serve the key lime."

I must say it totally changed my opinion of duck. I never really like duck meat as it is always chewy and gamey to me, but when it is braised or doused with the herbal sauce as in Dian Xiao Er, the duck meat becomes so much tenderer and full of sweet herbal flavor. The downside of this outlet is they will only seat you when your entire party is there. But generally it is pretty quick to get a table even when there is a long line. Food is served promptly and the turnover of tables is fast. The food is just so good. I like the duck in all the various herbal sauces. The fish slices, dong po pork (melts in your mouth), baby kailan with lime and salted fish (crunchy and tart), mongolian spare ribs, braised mushrooms with broccoli and tofu are all delicious. I am not a big fan of the marmite chicken though many others like it. They have set menus from 2 persons, besides ala carte dishes. They also have a duck portion with rice for one person which is great for days you happen to be alone and is in the mood for duck.

Apparently since I've left to pursue life in a different couple of continents, the main owner had passed away after becoming really ill. He had to sell the stall away to someone that really brought the place down. My parents even stopped their patronage. About a year ago, the former owner's brother took over the stall and has brought it back to greatness. If you're visiting Queensway Shopping Centre, or Ikea, this is the place to go for a good meal. The fried beef kway teow is truly one of the best in the business, and has a much more local flavour than anything else I've had (Hong Kong style included), and the fish slice kway teow with bean sprouts is a definite staple for the place.

They also fall a little short in the chili department (too watery and believe it or not, salty too) but it'll do.Good enough and better than most out there."

He mumbled then sort of waved us to a table.  When I sat down the first thing I noticed on the menu was that 40% of their staff are special needs. It asked for our patience and understanding.The menu was set up so that you scan with a mobile phone to order.  Not a lot of staff work involved other than serving.  But the staff smiled and said ""Please come back"" when we finished.The food was exceptional, tasty, and well-prepared.   The dumplings were better than any I have had with meat or pork. The spicy soup went really well with brown rice.  The salad was very fresh with an amazing dressing. The place was full but not noisy. The ambience and food put us in a great mood.My compliments to everyone there for delivering a very positive experience and adhering to noble, commendable principals.My only complaint was that no alcohol is served (no soju, maguli or Cass beer) but with such healthy, nutritious fare it makes perfect sense."

Would recommend the Kimchi pancake and the army stew. Doesn't feel like I'm missing out from good Korean food by having vegetarian. Reasonable pricing. Quite popular with the working crowd so would recommend making a reservation

While the server handed me the menu, I told him what I wanted so they could prepare the dish but also asked him to hold on to the drink.Food served within 5 minutes. The servers were very fast in punching the item on the computers and serving it. The ambience of this location is also pretty good - very airy and the use of light colored furniture in an open space dining place made it more inviting. For the food, I love it! The noodles are medium soft and chewy. The egg is sweet, the seaweeds gave an extra crunch, the pork bulgogi was tender and the sauce was sweet instead of spicy. Definitely a flavorful dish to try out.For beverage, I ordered the Rubus tea. It is very fruity drink topped with a small slice of orange and canned cherries. Price wise it is considered decent and will definitely try out the other chain. :)Tried the chef guksoo a week later at the same chain and wasn't impressive. I still prefer the Bibim Guksoo. The citrus drink was pretty decent too."

Situated in a HDB block below Telok Blangah, this place is well-decorated with different types of seatings and to the young at heart. Initially I thought the Bandung Latte was a caffeinated drink, until the server told me it wasn't. Still, this was a very nice drink. With the correct amount of steamed milk, vanilla and rose syrup added, it feels sweet and milky enough. The only downside to this is that I felt that it was rather pricey. The Macaron S'mores is also something unique to order here. The smores, which is essentially a marshmallow in between 2 macaron shells and smothered with the sauce of your liking (I chose Nutella). The smores burst upon the first mouthful. The marshmallows were soft and the Nutella made it feel more enriching. The shells were rather hard to chew on though. If you live nearby Telok Blangah, why not give this place a visit? I will find myself being here if I'm around the area again (I feel like trying the waffles!)"
