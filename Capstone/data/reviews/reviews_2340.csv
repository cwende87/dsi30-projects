The steamed prawns with garlic was just flat out not good. Can easily tell the prawns were not fresh. The texture was completely mushy on every single piece. The only decent plate was the veggie, which is incredibly hard to mess up. Should have known something was to since there was only 3 tables occupied at close to peak hours.

How did it take so long for us to realise how awesome it is?!They're a seafood restaurant but they also do meat dishes pretty well. A lot of their main dishes take time to prepare (it could be a half hour wait, or even longer during peak dining hours) but the wait is seriously worth it.If you're already hungry, I'd start with the salted egg fried fish skin appetizer. WARNING: These are extremely addictive. Crispy, just the right amount of salt, and not at all fishy. Almost like potato chips.They even have a chicken rice stall within the restaurant, so you could order from them if you need something to hold you over while you wait.The crab dishes here are fantastic. We've tried the steamed crab with hua diao wine, and the steamed crab with glutinous rice. If I had to choose, I'd go with the glutinous rice, because that in itself is already delicious.Last but not least, I really love their kou rou bao (steamed buns with marinated braised pork belly.) Again, this dish takes time to make, but DAMN SON. The pork is so tender and the sauce is boss.This is a great spot to go to if you have a big group, as the round tables can fit about 8 people each. Plus, the portions are big here, so they're meant for sharing."

This place opened along Joo Chiat Road a couple of years ago under the name ""Ubin Seafood"" owned by the people who formerly ran the original seafood restaurant on Pulau Ubin.To further add to the confusion, in 2012 there was a change of management, and the name of the place changed from ""Ubin Seafood"" to ""Ubin Kitchen"". Chatter on the internet forums tells me that the head chef from the original Ubin establishment still helms the kitchen.Complicated history aside, it's possible to rattle off a laundry list of signature dishes that one should order:Steamed crab & glutinous rice (for 3-4 persons at $58)Bamboo ClamsOyster Hokkien NoodlesSteamed belly pork buns (Kou Rou Bao)fried shrimp rolls (hae zhor)salted egg yolk squidfried rice noodles (bee hoon)In particular, the oyster noodles were tender and had a hearty sauce, old school style. You see clams in the photo but there's some oysters somewhere hiding beneath the noodles. The pork buns were a DIY affair, fluffy steamed buns arrive separate from the pork and you'd have to create your pork sandwich yourself.

The steamed buns came hot and fresh, while a separate plate held five slices of marinated braised pork belly. A a bit of a Do-it-yourself burger where you take a strip of pork belly put it inside a steam bun. If you'd like, you can also add a strip of lettuce to make it the more ""healthy."" :PAs for the steamed crab, it was nothing short of special. This is not just some crab you put in a steamer and that's it. Nope, these crabs have a sophisticated flavour that blends hua diao wine with the juices of the crab. Wow. While all the crabs in Singapore focus on Chili Crabs or Pepper Crabs, it was nice to try something different for a change.Overall, the food at Ubin Kitchen was fantastic! Food wise, I'm of the view that it's 4.5 stars, but have settled on 4 stars since the server did not inform us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for both dishes."

It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The steamed crab is cooked in hua diao wine and ginger.

We loved japanese food and the first restaurant that caught our eye was this as we were too hungry to search for the mall directory. We had never tried the food at this restaurant before and was rather intrigue by its menu. They don't service the usual japanese fare. There are a lot of stewed and nabe (hot pot) in their menu. They also dish out food for the health conscious as you can choose the 5 grain rices and all. Great discovery and will definitely check out their other joints.

Sitting in the coffee shop, one feels immediately immersed in the life of the heartlands, with the friendly Indian uncle who greets you in Chinese or dialect and never fails to crack us up. However, any local would know that Mr. Teh Tarik is a chain store with outlets in many places, a representation of the capital progress of our nation. This particular outlet is my favourite though for the atmosphere - a real, old-school coffee shop that never fails to remind me of what Singapore is to me. The prata here is crispy and not bad, and of course, the teh tarik is good too. For those who like to hang around the area, it is an excellent place for supper when it is not so hot to be sitting outdoors. The prices are reasonable at a dollar for the teh tarik, so it is inexpensive too. For the friendly neighbourly feel that is quintessentially the Singapore I remember, I'd definitely be back for many times more in the future ahead."

Then we ordered the set meal for 8 but they said we couldnt have it as ""no big prawns"" so we had to think all over again for a la cart which was only $80 less with less dishes and no doubt lowe value food. The fried rice was only egg no seafood for $ 26 and one small bowl each. The service continued to be inept and nonchalant, even rude. We didnt feel we were wanted there.

The famous pepper and chili crabs lived up to their hypes. All other foods were fantastic. Every dish that we ordered was good.

Once she took the initiative order, she checked with the chef on the ingredients and to warn him to wash the woks before preparing these special dishes. I noticed she was wearing a hair net after talking with the chef. This made me think there is a high standard level of cleanliness in the kitchen.All the dishes we ordered were equally great. Plus she order exactly the correct amount so nothing was left for 14 people. We have no idea how much we ordered of each item so we're now anticipating the bill. What did we get?Chili and pepper crab. I preferred the black pepper both both were good.  I liked the vegetable dishes. The produce is very fresh. One was Chinese broccoli and scallops and the other dragon greens, mushrooms and garlic. Cereal shrimp (okay but others liked it), beef and onion, fried cod (cubed) and shrimp friend rice. Lastly the mini buns were light and the outside crust lightly crunchy. With about 5 sodas and 10% service, the total price was $750 for 14 or about $50 a person. The service was fantastic.

Honestly, I was a bit disoriented.  Sweet is dessert for me, not a main course.  Maybe it was an off night, and more sugar was added than less.  Maybe I'm spoiled with phenom Indo-Vietnamese-Malaysian-Chinese-Cambodian-Lao-Korean-Thai chefs educating my palate in Los Angeles.  Maybe.  Willing to cut some slack here but if this dish should be soulfully sweet, then that was the last time I will have had the famous chilli crab.  I can't claim the crabmeat tasted sweet because it didn't (the creature traveled from another country).  Had it been caught in the nearest river or sea, it would have been sweet.   The other dishes we ordered were very good however:  prawns with golden salted egg, mee goreng Malay style, kang kong, fried rice.   Service was very good.Tip:  Jumbo Seafood is also a tourist destination, prices are high, even for Singapore.  I'd come to this location if you were to visit as it's on the water, if you like H20.  Check out the Yelpista pix."

Suppressing all scepticism, I took a visiting friend to Jumbo which is one of the four chilli crab Meccas here all lined conveniently next to each other along East Coast park. We got one chilli crab to share between two of us which cost around $62. No chilli crab is complete without deep fried buns to mop up the gravy and Jumbo's are just sheer perfection: crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside with just a slight sweetness to them. At this point, I need to throw up my hands and admit that YES Jumbo's serves some pretty damn good chilli crab. The gravy is delicious. Rich and thick, the best part is the sharp kick to it at the end. I was expecting it to be a lot spicier than it was but it had too much flavour packed into it to make up for it. The crab itself was juicy and tender. We struggled to get all the flesh out of the shell but it's worth prying out every little bit. The atmosphere is also incredibly relaxing especially if you snag an outside table right next to the ocean. The staff were all very prompt and efficient. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they made no motion to hurry us and even gave us a 10% discount at the end for no reason! My only gripe is the very small vegetarian selection which is somewhat understandable at a seafood restaurant. My mother got rice with vegetable stir fry which came in a tiny portion costing $18.

Quality of the crab is excellent - sweet fresh crab that goes well with the sauce. The black pepper crab is not as good though so perhaps stick to the chili crab for Jumbo.

Although I love crab, my boyfriend isn't a fan but we still decided to go because our new friends in Hong Kong raved about trying pepper and/or chili crab. We ordered:- Chili crab- Fried cod fish with spicy sauce- Scallops wrapped in yam ring- Broccoli with scallops- Steamed (white) buns and deep fried bunsThe chili crab was wonderful! The crab we received, a portion size for three people, was the largest crab I've ever seen!! Certainly fitting considering the name of the restaurant. I'm not usually a fan of filling up on bread, but it was difficult to resist dipping the steamed buns in the chili crab sauce. And.. this is was after I ate spoonfuls on top of my rice. So much flavor!The broccoli with scallops were fine, but the scallops wrapped in yam were even better! My boyfriend almost decided to get a second order of them. Finally, the fried cod fish was delicious! I would order that again as well. Our bill ended up around SGD 200-250.. If you're not opposed to taking a day trip to Malaysia (possible via bus, car or taxi), we were told you can get much more pepper or chili crab for much cheaper there! Regardless, I highly recommend you check this place out if you're in Singapore! Extra tips and FYIs:- There is no AC!- Make reservations if you want to avoid a long wait during certain days or times.- The menu has plenty of pictures and English to help guide your ordering.- Chili crab can be quite messy; I recommend using the disposable bibs they give out.- Don't be afraid to flag down any server you see if you need something!- If you have trouble breaking through the HUGE claws or other parts of the crab, you can put them on a plate and ask the server to have the kitchen break them for you! You don't want any going to waste :)"

We were seated quite quickly due to our reservation, and it was outside the restaurant closer to the water. I didn't really like our table because it was pretty close to where everybody goes to smoke so I occasionally had the odor of cigarette smoke while eating, but it wasn't too bad.The Chili crab and satays were very good, but the black pepper crab was too peppery.The cereal prawns had a lot of cereal but not too much prawn. The fish in banana leaf was decent. Overall it was pretty decent but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."

The east coast branch is by far the most popular on the island. I am guessing it's because of its complimentary location near the sea adds to one's seafood dining experience. It's super crowded on weekend evenings. Do not attempt to go without a booking, especially if it is a public holiday weekend. Overall, Jumbo doesn't disappoint. It serves quality seafood amidst a casual and family-friendly environment. Singaporean families (across generations - think aunty, uncle, cousins...) gather here for good seafood. Food: 1. Pepper crab - Awesome! Get your bibs ready! It can get messy. 2. Chili crab sauce & man tou - I LOVE their man tous (fried buns). It's fried to golden perfection! Crispy on the outside but soft & smooth on the inside. I could eat a plate of these (they are pretty small in size), especially dipped in chili sauce. TIP: you can order the chili crab sauce without having to order the whole crab itself. So you can have your crab in another sauce (black pepper) and still get to enjoy the wholesome goodness of dipping your man tous in the chili sauce. Double happiness. 3. Fried you tiao - LOVE! These are fried doughs stuffed with fish paste. It may sound strange to foreigners but they are heavenly. A must-try for sure. 4. Mee goreng - Good. A little spicy though. Be warned. 5. Mix vegetable & mushrooms - Good. The mushrooms were so fresh. 6. Steam prawns with egg - LOVE! The prawn was so fresh & sweet. It comes served with a sweet black sauce which goes so well with the prawns. I could eat this all day. Service: - Very efficient!"

The one on the East Cost is the best (IMHO). There is nothing fancy about this restaurant.  Come to sit by the ocean on uncomfortable plastic chairs, enjoy some cold beer, and devour as many crabs as you can.  The awesome Jumbo experience is very simple and consists of only five elements, so anyone can execute this plan.  Here it is:1) Sit outside, not inside2) Order beer, and then keep ordering it throughout the meal (you'll see why shortly)3) Order lots of Chili Crabs4) Order a ton of Man-tou buns (fried, not steamed).5) After you are done with the first 4 things, order Sago for dessert (even if the waitstaff gives you a hard time about it).I believe Chili Crab may be one of nature's most perfect food substances.  The crab is huge, meaty, and sweet.  The sauce is beyond compare - rich, tangy, and oh so spicy.  And extra good when you sop it up with the Man-tou (kind of like little savory doughnuts).  Lot's of fried spicy goodness there.  Order double the number of buns they suggest - I seem to prefer a higher bun to sauce ratio then is standard.I see many reviewers indicate you should go with Black Pepper Crab.  While that is a fine dish, I've always preferred the sauciness of Chili Crab.  But try them both - you can't go wrong.  Also, remember to wear clothes that can get soiled.  Those crabs are messy, but that is half the fun.Finally, let me put in a word for Sago.  It's kind of like cold sweetened coconut soup with melon balls and ice shavings.  Delicious, refreshing, and the perfect antidote to your burning lips from the yummy Chili Crab.  My Father almost passed out from delight the first time he had Sago here.In short, when I next make the long, long, long trip from Chicago to Singapore I will be heading to Jumbo."

Not because of the food, no, no, but because of how messy you will get eating the delicious, drool inducing chili crab. This is some of the best stuff on earth. Seriously. If you come here for nothing else you will be quite happy. The crab is really fresh and the sauce is just so he right amount of spicy. It's very messy and finger lickin good. We also had the cereal prawn that was just a bit too sweet, it tastes very similar to coconut shrimp and also the yam covered scallops. They were also very good. You obviously have to have beer with your chili crab so make sure to grab a pitcher of tiger. This is the third or fourth time here from America, I will always come back here to eat. I love it so much. I'll be coming here for years to come. I wish they sold the chili sauce by the gallon. I would just drink it."

In California we have different types of crab so was almost positive it would not turn out the same :( It's also really good if you dip your bread into the chili sauce!

Perfect blend of a spicy and sweetness of a crabBoiled live shrimp comes in a wine soup - get about 3 per person.Chicken/Beef kabobs- tastes good if you dip it in their peanut sauce!Malaysia dry noodle- reminded me to be similar to a spaghetti with seafood in it. Mango- not sure if its the right season or if its just always good- but the mango is soft and sweet! perfect way to end your meal.Ate a lot more- but can't remember the names.

Order some fried buns (mantou) to soak up some of that delicious chilli sauce, and you've got a fantastic meal. It gets pricey, but it's worth it. A few tips for those non-natives ( that I learned the hard way): there are no napkins. How you're expected to eat this crab with no provided napkins is beyond me, but that's how it's done in SG. Stop by a convenience store and pick up a multi-pack of tissues, since that's what everyone uses for napkins. The restaurant provides you with a finger bowl to rinse your hands while eating.

Order a few of the fried mantou (buns) on the side, and get ready to soak up all that saucy goodness! (Trust me, you'll need more mantou than you think!)  For what you pay (about $55 a kg) it's pricey.  A crab will be anywhere between $50-80, and it's not a whole lot of food, but hey, when in Singapore...The cereal prawn ($20 or so) is also really good, make sure you order it with the shell off. Breaded in a slightly sweet and crunchy cereal breading, it's well worth a try.And don't be afraid of wearing the bib for the crab (ask for it if they don't offer), even the locals do it!"

I heard Singapore is known for their spicy crabs so of course we had to go somewhere really authentic to get it. This restaurant has a really nice bay view but it was raining that day so we couldn't sit outside to enjoy the scene. So the food. There was 13 of us and we ordered what seemed like everything on the menu so that we can try a little of everything. We got the spicy crab and the peppered crab which I guess for a non-seafood eater was pretty decent although I still wouldn't go out of my way to eat crab. My family really enjoyed it since they are seafood lovers. I do have to agree that it's probably the most flavorful crab I've ever tasted. To be honest, what I loved most about the meal was the little buns that came with the crabs. It really was just white dough with a little sugar but it was so soft and chewy and I think I probably had ten pieces all by myself. It was an overall good meal but because I don't really like seafood, I probably don't have the best judgment. One little boo boo was that they messed up our dessert and gave us a 13 people portion instead of a single serving like we asked and ended up just not giving us anything in the end after we waited for it foreverrrr. The service wasn't great but I guess we were a pretty loud annoying group with two babies that anyone would find hard to deal with."

The staff were friendly, accomadating and spoke ok English. The line of sushi chefs wore gloves and mouth guards. They cranked out an endless line of sushi and other items. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all very tasty. The portions were on the small side, but the prices were reasonable (s$2-9) on most things, so we were able to have a wider variety of items.We loved that besides soy sauce, each table had a supply of wasabi and pickled ginger."

The broth is rich in flavour and explodes in your mouth. The uncle even makes it an emphasis (a sign) that he doesn't re-fill the soup as it would dilute the flavours. Wow, that's quality.

He gives 3 pieces of prawn and slices of lean pork meat along with a regular bowl, and nothing to complain.

As soon as I saw it, I had to have it. I'm obsessed with Sushirrito in the Bay Area and always order a sushi burrito when it's available. I was excited at first to see they had very similar rolls like Salmon Samba and Geishas Kiss, though under different names. I should have been deterred by the first reviewer, but I did not heed those wise words, and my excitement diminished when I realized they wouldn't make me a fresh sushi burrito. All the rolls are displayed as halves, so I thought maybe if I ordered a full roll they'd make me new one (nope, just two halves). And of course, it tasted like it's been sitting around for a while. Sushirrito tells you it's best enjoyed immediately, and I think that's true with any sushi burrito. Moist seaweed just doesn't stay good for long. Overall, not terrible, but not worth it."

The sushi burrito is alright. I've had better and would not recommend this. They have a display of their various sushi burrito options on the window for you to choose from. You can either get a half burrito or full burrito. The rice was bland and the veggies tasted old (not fresh). I  got the rainbow shrimp burrito, which consisted of prawn tempura. However the prawn tempura was mushy and soft on the outside. You can tell that the burrito had been sitting out for a while and not fresh.

Sushi burrito is basically like an uncut sushi roll with more ingredients. While that can sound attractive because hei, who doesn't like sushi?, but Sushi Burrito did it completely all wrong. I tried their unagi sushi burrito. The amount of unagi is like the amount you would get on 4 pieces of unagi sushi while the rice and fillers would make maybe 4 sets of sushi roll (4 x 6/8 of your regular sushi!). What are the fillers? Cucumbers, pickled veggies, onions and LOTS of rice. If I want my veggies, I would go get myself a bowl of salad. Lots of veggies maybe good for you but I paid to get a meal where I can taste unagi in most of my bites. Nope. It was mostly rice and veggies. For the price, I would not recommend this place. On the good side, their packaging is very handy for a quick grab and it is a healthy option."

But i began to remove those thought as soon as I had my second bite. They are different. It taste so good and still fresh although i doubt it when i arrive at the stall and looking at those sushiburrito that already displayed. They just took those premade sushi and served it. Although it is still good, i wish they can make it fresh. Idk how it works for people who order half size. Maybe they will make the fresh version of that? Perhaps. So i just want to conclude my review that Sushi Burrito is a better version of handroll sushi that i usually have. It taste better than normal sushi or hand roll. It has good appearance. But perhaps, maybe more experimental flavor/sauce in the future. Note: the wasabi burned me"

It is not too far from the Kembangan MRT and you could probably see the signboard from afar.Came here as Mel had purchased 2 Sugar coupons for the waffles and we decided to try the waffles with Hokkaido Milk & Honey and Figs . We also ordered the B.F.F. 4 types of fries and four types of sauces. The waffle was over-crispy but the ice creams were delicious. It was melting on the tongue after putting it in your mouth. Didn't really like the waffle that much as this time round it was over-cooked.The B.F.F. was interesting mix of fries. I like the truffle fries as it was crunchy but it doesn't have much truffle flavor on it. The wedges and the criss-cut fries were al-right (probably cause I've been eating too much other stuffs before coming here). I didn't try the shoestring fries (Curly fries?). The dips I have no clue what they are besides the tartar sauce.This place is rather cosy and inviting. On the walls it has writings and interesting quotes. Was not as crowded as I thought it maybe especially on a Saturday evening. Definitely a good place to hang out or even board game sessions :)

From what I understand it has opened for over a year now and I have just learnt about this place via the SUGAR app. It is within walking distance of Kembangan MRT. We managed to easily find a parallel parking street parking spot along Changi Road.1. Rack o' Ribs ($22.80)The great BBQ aroma from this dish would make anyone hungry! It was slighly charred to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. For Singapore standards it's pretty good, still nowhere near what I used to eat daily in the States. For $22.80 it's not too pricey, although that's as much as I would ever pay for ribs in Singapore.The meat was juicy and tender. The ribs were well executed with the barbecue sauce over nicely done meat.2. Waffles with Ice Cream ($5.80 each)With the SUGAR app, we managed to buy each waffle with ice cream for about $2 each! But nonetheless even at $5.80 It's still quite reasonable, compared to some cafes that charge like $9 for a whole waffle and ice cream. This is indeed only half a waffle but there's so much to love about this waffle.The waffle is delightfully crispy! It is not the fluffy kind, some online reviewers have mentioned that it tastes like over-cooked waffles or even ""burnt"". But to me, it was nice and crispy and I like it this way. The chocolate ice cream was a bit bitter, the green tea ice cream was nice and had the legit green tea taste in there. The salted caramel was the sweet ice cream amongst the 3 flavours. The waffle was slightly salty, some of my friends didn't like it so salty, but I felt that it was a good compliment for the salted caramel ice cream, since the ice cream was so sweet. Waffles and ice cream! Who can resist such a great combination of colours and flavours.The food at Rice & Fries may not be super awesome , it's nevertheless tasty and the ambience is very enjoyable.

The taste was very savory and the crust was thin and crispy. I personally like the crust to be thin, and pizzas with crusts that are overly thick and floury turn me off.We also had a few other pizzas such as the triple meat pizza and the pepperoni pizza, which were all good but no doubt, the pizza to try here is the seafood pizza.

The charred fatty cuts of meat are pretty much amazing, and I'm partial to the roast pork and roast chicken. It's also reasonably priced, at around S$4-6 for a packet of chicken rice. Ask for the dark meat (chicken thigh) instead of the leaner cuts. Trust me, it's worth the calories.The stall is located within the coffeeshop named ""Keng Bee Restaurant"" at the corner of the building facing the Caltex gas station. Seating within the coffeeshop is limited and there's parking at the back. The line is out the door pretty much at lunchtime, so do come early before they sell out.Depending on how long the line is, the guy at the stall might get a little grouchy or impatient with you. I also have to knock them for a less than stellar chilli sauce which is practically watered down beyond recognition.The stall is closed on Tuesdays, and a different hawker helms the evening shift at the same stall, so be aware that the food served might be different at dinner.TLDR; Old school roast chicken and roast pork with charred fatty cuts, reasonably priced but a bad attitude with a long wait.

It's got three layers of heaven: (i) juicy inside, (ii) marbled fatty area  and (iii) a crunchy skin.

Word of Advice: To best enjoy the roast pork, DO NOT put any sauce on top. It will dilute the flavor. However, be sure to ask the uncle to put sauce on top of the rice. The separation of rice with sauce and the roast pork is just a perfect complement.  Lines are obviously long, Locals already know this little secret.

So I got a plate of char siew + siew yoke rice, and sat down to wolf it down.Fate intervened of course, and uncle had generously slapped on my plate some rough cut meats, liberally marbled with soft, juicy fat. As I took a second to admire his handiwork before shovelling it into my now ravenous mouth-hole, I realised the beauty in what lay before me - the rough cut meant he did not stinge on razor-thin slivers, and the chunkier segments offered more bite and flavour, so I could really experience the char in his char siew.Though I did savour each tasty morsel, it was gone too soon, and all I had left was the simple soup to end what was a very tasty meal for just three dollars.

To upsize your steak, pay $5 extra.By all means it's not the best steak, you get what you pay for, really. Beef quality is only a small notch above Aston's or Jack's place. Fries are crispy out of the fryer, and for the salad, you get butter lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce. If you're in the mood, they do serve caipirinhas. :)4 stars cos it's value for money, but don't come in here expecting Morton's or Ruth's Chris.

The best deal on the menu is easily the signature Meat (you are getting the steak, no questions asked) served with an UNLIMITED supply of French fries and fresh lettuce.  P.S I wish they replaced the French fries with rice, kidding! Clearly, this is not an Asian restaurant :-)For doneness of my meat, I chose medium-rare. The rib eye steak came out fantastic. I had no idea the French could grill! You also have the option of three sauces: mango, mustard and chipotle to mix with your steak and fries. Don't fret, if there is no seating space on the first floor. There is a large 2nd floor with another set of 8 dinning tables or more. it's a bit neat to see expats living in the neighborhood playing a card game of sorts on the second floor during the evening. The big surprise is that there is a beautiful terrace in the back that accommodates 20 or more people, if you are keen for a fun night amongst friends under neath the stars and in an enclosed outdoor setting.Four stars for the price - $20 for char grilled steak and unlimited homemade fries and the fact you won't find this type of restaurant anywhere else on Joo Chiat or anywhere else on the East Coast for that matter."

The decor certainly is very impressive with books neatly arranged from wall to wall and old phones decorated at various locations. The ambience is great for catch up with friends over a drink. We've ordered our main courses all from the promo menu and truffle Parmesan fries. It took close to 20 mins before the fries arrived followed by pasta and burger. The Pork neck grill took another 10 mins to be delivered. Sadly, the burger and the Pork neck was more salty than needed while the pasta is blend. We are more sad that with all the truffle shavings on the pasta and pork neck, we can't smell the truffles. Which is very unusual as this is not the first time we've had truffle dishes. Even with the promotion, each dish is about $28. And for that price, I don't see the value when I have the 3 small pieces of pork neck done like schnitzels, topped with creamy sauce and potato chips that occupied half of the plate. We couldn't finish our food because I get tired chewing the pork neck and the pasta was too blend to warrant anymore consumption. The saving grace is the burger because it's not too big and, the parmesan fries has a very nice truffle mayo dip.

We ordered Eggs Benedict with portobello & Parmesan crisps and Smashed Avocado with Smoked salmon with Matcha latte & orange juice. While Matcha & juice was tasty & fresh, the food was bland.

It did look like it had a nice brunch menu, and their burger offerings for dinner looked quite nice. At around 6:30 PM however, they shut off most of the lights, which I think was a real mood killer. No need to have lighting resembling that of a sketchy club, when you are in a nice café where people want to go to talk each other, and in fact, see each other too."

And while the oysters on offer certainly are fresh and yummy and great value during happy hour (5pm-7pm) or all-night on Mondays... the real food. The proper food. The cooked food. Oh how brilliant it is.It's all small sharing plates, and the menu says order quite a few dishes for just two, but frankly we find that's a little generous. For groups of 4-5, between 8-12 dishes is more than plenty. What's good? Almost everything. Twice I've been and twice I've ordered all the garden dishes. The Brussel Sprouts are to die for. When you pick up everything on the plate you get salty-sweet-charred-heat all in a mouthful. The cabbage too. The burrata has been on fleek each time I've ordered it, and the Snow Crab and Manila Clams have me wiping the dish clean with the awesome bread each. And. Every. Time. I'd give the fish dishes a miss, I tried the tuna, the rainbow trout, and the ceviche and all weren't as impressive as the other offerings. For proteins I like the chicken more than the beef or pork. It's a well-crafted dish... though companions liked the beef very much. The pork was kinda meh. And definitely have desserts. There're only two but both are good solid sweets than really hit the spot. I prefer the panna cotta because it's not as sweet or rich as the chocolate mousse, but if you like a good mousse, this is as good as you'll find anywhere. ANYWHERE. IN THE WORLD. So... y'know.

There is a choice of outdoor seating but it is prohibitively hot in Singapore sometimes. I made an online booking via a third party website for 5 people on a Monday for 8pm a week in advance, and was surprised that there weren't any tables for 7pm ish. Steffi C and I arrived early, at 730pm and surprise, our table wasn't ready, and we sat outside. We ordered a few oysters but they only came 20 minutes after, when our table was nearly ready. We tried to hurry this Eurasian-looking server for our table but he was sort of... curt. Never mind.The fuss about Mondays at Humpback is because oysters are half price here, all-night. They do have half-priced oysters everyday, but only from 5-7pm, which most working people cannot come on time. You might want to avoid Mondays if you want half-priced oysters and have 5-7pm on another day free.They have a comprehensive cocktail menu, but I prefer my cocktails orders to be taken by a bartender and customized to my preference. We opted for a Riesling on our very nice server's recommendation.Because we were a party of 5, we got a few small plates to share, apart from the oysters. We had the burrata (yum!), gruyere and feta tapioca balls (yum!), brussel sprouts (I felt it was undercooked but my friends liked it crunchy), pork (too pink for my liking), wagyu (not bad), calamari (yum), tuna (we didn't realize it was raw, 3.5/5). The oysters were fresh, sweet, and nobody had the runs after. Not all varieties of oysters were available, as they source whatever is available direct from Washington state, US. I do love my PNW seafood. My peeve about the oysters were that for more than 20 oysters, they had a tiny pot of vinaigrette. Passing the little jar around was quite annoying.The unexpected star of the meal was the chocolate mousse. I will be sure to order my own portion next time I come here. Bill came up to about 75 per person, but we had wine and oysters and many many plates to share. I imagine it would be more expensive on a non-Monday. Book your seats!"

Until the day that I found out about this place through Natalie H. ""Oysterssssssssss"" was all she said, and I was in. The $2-$3 oysters (5-7pm on weekdays+saturday, all day on mondays) drew me to this place, but what really made me like it were the sides that we got. They're the guys behind Sugarhall in Telok Ayer too, which also has excellent sides, and I wasn't disappointed here.I really cannot find another bad to say about the sides we got. Well ok the pork was a bit pink, not sure if that was on purpose but I did recall someone at work (I'm in healthcare) telling me that you should NEVER eat raw pork and hence my fork stayed far away from THAT dish. Otherwise, the burrata, feta tapioca balls, wagyu, calamari, brussel sprouts and tuna were all excellent. I think I might come back just for the sides next time. The sides were bigger than I expected, enough for each person in a group of 5 to get a taster portion and just a bit more.Service was... well they were really crowded and busy on a monday and MAYBE there was just one poor guy shucking oysters because that's the only reason I think of to explain why the oysters took so long to come?I'll still come back though.

I've tried their competitor before and was looking forward to how good the impossible patty really was and it did not disappoint! Impossible Chedda ($23.00)This was such a delight to have. It still baffles me how they managed to get it looking, tasting and feeling so much like meat when it's all plant based. The only thing is, I wished the added less ketchup. It did feel like they were trying to mask whatever non-meatiness there was but having tasted the patty on its own, I think it would have handled itself just fine. The other parts of the burger was great too. The brioche bun was beautifully toasted yet remained soft and fluffy while the onion purée & pickles gave it an extra lift. Overall a fantastic burger Burning Rice ($18.00) The burning rice was pretty interesting too. A great option for friends who need something more asian while bearding to a burger joint. The rice had a good spice added to it and it's interesting that they serve it with a burger patty. Be warned though, it's a pretty big bowl of carbs!Sticky Icky Wicky ($7.00)Finally! A sticky date pudding done right. Too many times I've ordered a sticky date pudding or sticky toffee pudding in Singapore and it was a let down. This on the other when an absolute delight to have. It's warm, sticky, sweet, yummy. The kind of dessert that warms your heart and soul while you swallow it. Contrast that with the ice cold ice cream it's served with and it was absolutely yummy. Overall, we loved the place. The food we tried were really good and I will definitely be back. And yes, for the Impossible Burger."

My favorite was the BBQ Bacon burger, although the regular and chicken were also delicious. We ventured up to the very buys rooftop bar on the 3rd floor which had nice views of the city.

The food (mostly burgers) on level 2 (Three Buns) was good but not worth the price. I shared the Smoking B-Boy which was 150gm of beef patty with bacon and cheese and fried shallots (bawang goreng). The fried shallot was nice, gave a different dimension to the beef. For $28++, you just get a burger and nothing else. No sides or anything. I had a lemonade jerk which came with slices of grapefruit and lemon. It was fizzy and not too sweet. I could taste the slight bitterness of the grapefruit. I tried the sticky date pudding which was not bad but came in a tiny container. I nicked a bit of the ""chili fries"" which was also not too bad. The food is generally ok, but the service could be better or flexible. To be fair, it was only one wait staff who was that. The others were quite lovely. I was taken aback when the said wait staff flatly refused to do individual billing even before we ordered especially when we were a big group. Many eateries have started doing individual billing as it just made it easier for everyone instead of wasting time trying to figure out the cost. I have also been to places when they can spilt the bill even when it was just 2 persons dining. They need to play catch up in this aspect. The same wait staff was also very adamant about us hurrying up (close to 30 minutes of our arrival and we were settling in and looking at the menu, taking pictures and just trying to decide on what to order) in placing our order and telling us we need to vacate in an hour time. Again we were stunned. Never have I been to a place where the staff would actually say that. Usually if there is a time limit on the table, they would inform us once we got seated. Not after 30 minutes and then saying we have one hour to place order and eat. Thank goodness our efficient organizer kept the email reservation where it clearly stated our timing. It was for 2 hours, and if the kitchen cannot handle big group orders, then maybe they should not impose a time limit in the first place. And the place was fairly empty when we were there, definitely not full house with a line waiting outside. Another wait staff spilled my drink (too generous and filled to the brim) on me and my cloth bag (my ipad is inside!) but he was so apologetic and concerned that I just waved it off. And thank goodness it was a cloth bag so it was totally washable. I am not sure if I will return as the burgers were not spectacular (I would rather go to Roadhouse or &made or DB Bistro) and that antsy eager beaver wait staff certainly marred the experience in wanting us to just order, eat and go."

NOTE: Honky-Tonk was the only chicken burger on the menu, can't speak for the other burgers.We were sitting on the 2nd floor and the place looked nice until the sun went down and it became dark. Would have been a better place to have lunch at instead of dinner in my opinion. We also had to wait 45 mins for our dessert. We were told that the kitchen was busy and that it took awhile to warm the pudding. This would have been okay if the pudding arrived steaming hot which was not the case. Plus, my friend's reservation to the 3rd floor lounge had to be released to someone else as we were still waiting for the dessert. Overall, in my opinion it is overrated and not worth the money.

I like the multi-level venue that offers a different experience depending on the mood you're in.On the bottom, it's a casual outdoor spot where you can take away a burger or scoff it there and then. Past the charming door hosts and up the quirky stairwell painted by Melbourne artist David Bromley, you'll come to the dining area where Burgers and fun pre-mixed cocktails are the order of the day. The staff here are delightful, making recommendations and having a bit of fun with customers. I love their colourful shirts and great attitudes. The burger I tried was pretty bloody delicious, though a little soggy on the bottom by the time I got through eating it. Next time I'd skip the sauces as not only do they create the soggy bun, but they add unnecessary sweetness for this savoury lover.One level up and behind a big black door is a colonial feeling cocktail lounge. Here it's about serious cocktails, both the old school and the modern classics as well as some Potato Head creations. I settled on a Martini and loved the glassware and the delightful handkerchief-like placemat it was sat on. If downstairs is for the young at heart, this space is for proper grown ups... or those of us who like to at least pretend we are.Up one more level and there's a rooftop bar. We didn't experience this as it was a scorching day and I felt as if my face might melt off. On a cool evening, this might just be the pick of the bunch. Guess I'll just have to make another visit, right?"

I'd picked this place as it promised good food in an interesting location, and the decors (designed by some Australian guy with a fear of flying...) had been much hyped about.Good things first: The decor was really quite impressive. We were seated at the Three Buns restaurant (second floor) and blue floral designs decorated the walls with artfully mismatched furniture and quirky statues, lending a whimsical vibe to the area. Most guests are seated in comfy-looking couches surrounding low tables, but our group of 14 got the large communal dining table in the middle of the room. The stairwell featured checkered tiles and more interesting statues/paintings, and the bar on the third floor reminded me of a 1900s Gentleman's bar- dark woods, heavy furniture, the most amazing collection of liquor in bottles of every kind. It was amazing and one could really appreciate the planning put into the design of this place.HOWEVER, the food was just ok. Yes, this is a burger joint, but we were a bit disappointed that they didn't really have any decent alternatives for those who were craving something else. I mean, usually there would be at least 2 sides which could pass off as a decent meal on its own? But anyway, most of us tried the Baby Huey (beef patty), Honky Tonk (chicken), 4 stories (double beef patty)... The verdict was that the Honky Tonk was the best due to the excellent pairing of the buttermilk chicken fillet and tangy coleslaw. We tried the Naughty Fries (potato spuds with salsa and a hell lot of parsley) and Sticky Date pudding too. My fries were alright, luckily not as bad as the one that Natalie had. The Sticky Date pudding was good but the portion was TINY for $8.Bad things last: The service was pushy and hurried. We had a reservation from 1230-1430, and while we did take SOME time to order, there was this guy who kept on rushing us and telling us that we had to get out by 2pm... He must have said it at least 4 times in 10 minutes. (Turned out that they got the timing wrong, we left before 1430 anyway) Yes, I know that you're popular, yes, I know that you have tables to turn, but it could have been conveyed in a less authoritative tone. I'm not sure if they even apologised after we informed them that they had gotten the end-time of our reservation wrong.Would I come back? Maybe... But a return visit isn't near the top of my agenda now."

It's a cool place. But on the two occasions I went there, I found myself being pretty disappointed with the food. Overall all I can say was that the food was nothing special. It was not terrible but not quite worth the 20+++ price tag for a burger. The homemade cola and all were pretty undrinkable to most of us who ordered it. The service was bleh as well. I ain't gonna say much about this because I used to work in F&B and understand how it gets on the flip side. But bleh. Could be much better overall. It's alright.

I was bummed because it's such a lovely looking place. So I gave it a chance and asked if I could change my drink because I absolutely hated this dishwater. The server refused saying it was just probably not to my liking and they couldn't help if I don't like it. They would however add more yuzu syrup to make it taste better. I appreciated that gesture but I did not appreciate her reasoning. Some people sitting next to me overheard our conversation and told me this happened to them earlier too and they were told nothing could be done. So they left most of their drinks untouched. What a pity. Everyone just writes it off as bad customer service in Singapore. But I say, it's a top down issue.

Left me needing a huge bottle of ice water to wash down the taste.Honkey Tonk ($18) - the chicken was done impeccably well. Was crisp, tender and moist. Again, the bun was just a filler. Personally, not a fan of chicken burgers but the execution of this was pretty good. Likely to go back for this one.Finished off with a Sticky Icky Wicky ($8) - was moist and was not too sweet.

The entire Duxton Hill area has a nice vibe to it and I loved the setting of the entire place. However, the service was really bad. From the girl at the counter who was in an extremely sour mood, to our server who cold shouldered us the whole night."

The price was exorbitant considering the burger tasted mediocre (nothing special). It had a lovely sauce on in, but just felt that for the price we were paying it should have been bigger or at least come with a side. NOTE: Honky-Tonk was the only chicken burger on the menu, can't speak for the other burgers.We were sitting on the 2nd floor and the place looked nice until the sun went down and it became dark. Would have been a better place to have lunch at instead of dinner in my opinion. We also had to wait 45 mins for our dessert. We were told that the kitchen was busy and that it took awhile to warm the pudding. This would have been okay if the pudding arrived steaming hot which was not the case. Plus, my friend's reservation to the 3rd floor lounge had to be released to someone else as we were still waiting for the dessert. Overall, in my opinion it is overrated and not worth the money. If you are coming for the ambience try coming at in the afternoon or for a early dinner and if you're lucky you would snag a seat at the rooftop bar too."

After so much talk about Potato Head, I've managed to pull a decent excuse off my exercise regimen to come savour the burgers here.... and fries *ahem*.My friend and I came on a Sunday evening, and the good thing is that the place was not crowded; it was easy enough to get a seat. The problem is that it is located in Keong Saik, which means parking is always a problem. Hence, you can get a seat, but most of the time you're not gonna find parking.Tried: Rambo and the Burning Man burgers. They are very delicious, although I wish they were bigger. The buns are baked from whole meal, making this a little more healthy compared to the sin I'll be ingesting.- The Rambo burger is mutton/lamb, which they managed to mask over the gamey taste with lots of spices and I believe... a blue-cheese kinda sauce? I might be wrong, but it sure tasted like it. The combination of the sauces and spices sure gave it a pretty unique taste.- The Burning Man, now we're talking. A nice slice of beef patty well grilled with mayo and ketchup, topped with Californian jalapenos to spice up the taste. It was good. However, the burning man's jalapenos has some serious zing into it, which was fine for me but not for my friend... you have been warned!- Also tried the Naughty Fries, which are basically fresh but soggy potato chips slathered with a generous dashing of cheese sauce and beef chili (the Mexican kind). It literally was one of the best cheese fries I had so far.Rants: Wish the burgers could be bigger. The sizes of these burgers remind me of what you can get from MacDonald's (no not the big mac). That's the reason why I had two burgers instead of just one. And the prices of each burger is kind of expensive ranging in the $20s, without any side dishes or fries or salads etc.. Burgers are tasty, but the pricing still leaves a bitter taste. You have been warned!Raves: The whimsical theme of the décor leaves a nice chill-out location if you're into these kind of things.

Its super instagramable. I had pretty high expectations but after I saw the menu things changed. The food here is super expensive. Like 25 dollars for a burger the size of my fist. My sister ordered the burger and I was so shocked at how small it was.  It was literally a slider size.  I ordered the wings, which were meant to be appetizers but I got them as my meal. They weren't your average buffalo wings. The sauce on the outside was a spicy sweet chili sauce and there were spring onions and deep fried onions as garnishes. The outside was crispy and the flavor was unique.  They were probably the cheapest thing on the menu so I was actually pretty satisfied with my meal. The rest of the people that I went with got burgers and I felt so bad for them because of how much money they had spent on the smallest burger ever. Go here for average burgers if you don't mind over paying for them."

So I called in to make a reservation, but an automated voice answering machine told me I would receive a text message to complete the reservation, which I did. It was a short URL to make a reservation via Chope. However on Chope, I could only select a maximum party size of 6. So in the comments I asked for 2 more seats.A few hours later I got a call saying that their cafe's reservation policy requires each person to spend at least $25 and order a main course. Waffles which are priced $18.50+ with 2 scoops of ice cream are not considered a main course. Even the staff encouraged me to walk in. This is ridiculous. So we decided to walk in, and the food better be worth the effort!Despite the phone call, I was delighted to be greeted by the beautiful ice cream display!And I pinched myself to be sure I wasn't dreaming when I saw the $23 per pint price tag. Okay, let's see if their ice cream is really twice as good as other competitors, to be priced this high.The interior has a very homely, retro feel to it, the lighting isn't instagram's best friend. You will have to improvise or try and get a table by the windows.1. Beef Bolognese Cheese Fries $15+With truffle tries price at $14, we decided to try something else. Sadly, this dish wasn't what we expected, even though there is supposedly cheese in the sauce. We couldn't taste any. It was a plate of very soggy fries, with a very under seasoned beef bolognese sauce.2. Squid Ink Risotto $25+Tasted cheesy and I felt gerlat very quickly. This is the first plate of Risotto that I didn't like, I am normally a huge fan of Risotto.It's waffle time! Despite the unsatisfying experience with the main courses, I was so certain the highly instagrammable waffles with ice cream would be the highlight of my night!3. Waffles with Mao shan wang durian and belgian chocolate $18.50+I liked that the durian ice cream colour wasn't overly yellow, which a lot of ice cream parlours, normally add yellow colouring to, it didn't smell very fragrant but it tasted good. I liked the durian ice cream. The Belgian chocolate tasted okay, it didn't leave an impression for me. The waffles, which I was looking forward to, tasted ok, I've definitely had better waffles in the surrounding area.4. Waffles with Pulut Hitam and Pistacchio $18.50+The only redeeming factor that Chatper 55 had for me tonight, was the Pulut Hitam ice cream, which I truly enjoyed. However not all the girls at my table liked it. It wasn't displayed, but they had it in the freezer. You could bite into the black rice bits in the ice cream. It a legit, pulut hitam ice cream! The Pistacchio was also a memorable ice cream flavour. You can distinctively taste the pistacchio.The bill for 6 girls and we weren't very big eaters, so asking all 6 of us to order a main course each isn't the wisest cafe policy, even from a business stand point.The staff weren't well organized and took a long while to clear our table. The first staff cleared one plate, and a male staff cleard 2 more plates. We were done with all our plates and when the waffles came, we still had half a table worth of dirty plates. Only after the second waffle came to our table, did another male staff who served us the waffles, clear the rest of the dirty dishes.The chinese local lady at the cashier who spoke mandarin was very friendly and polite. I had higher hopes for their ice cream and waffles with such a high price tag on each plate. On the bright side, they have BOGO weekday lunch offers.wifi password : chapter55"

So today, despite the heavy afternoon rain, we walked from our office to sought out the place. Walking along Eng Hoon Street, the restaurant was easily noticeable by the corner of Tiong Poh Road. It's pretty big. One thing that I found very attractive on their signboard was how they highlighted their ""1 for 1 on weekdays"" offer.We went as a group of 5. Seeing that the restaurant is not Halal-certified, I couldn't try out their main courses, hence I went with the desserts. Like one of the popular quotes that I snapped stated, ""Life is short. Eat dessert first!""The appetizers came as bowls of mushroom soup. The mushrooms weren't in chunky forms but they were grounded in, which was nice!Two of my colleagues ordered one plate of white wine pasta (Vongole?) and the other, some sort of seafood pasta. Can't recall the names of the dishes, but both of them commented that the spices in both of their pastas were too overpowering; one even masked the white wine sauce. They also ordered buffalo wings (5 pieces). Personally, from what I see, those wings were overpriced. Such small pieces for $16?!Came my Salted Caramel Waffle and a glass of Black Cow. Funny names to give the floats: ""Black Cow"" for Coke Float and ""Snow White"" for Sprite Float. Well, as you can see from my waffle photo, I just loved the presentation. What a plating! Loved how they stenciled in cocoa powder of their logo at the corner of the plate. The waffle itself cost me $17 due to the fact that I opted for 2 scoops of ice-cream. Otherwise it would have been $15 for one. I opted for a scoop of Salted Caramel and Hazelnut gelato on my waffle, while I got another scoop of Hersheys gelato for my coke float. Loved the waffle!We even sampled a teaspoon of some of the gelatos on display. I had the Salted Egg flavoured, Cotton Candy flavoured and Strawberry Cheesecake flavoured... Nice. But definitely, I have tasted better and creamier gelatos elsewhere."

We ordered buffalo wings to share, I remember it being decent but not particularly authentic but on the spicy side.  The dish that blew me away was one of their fresh pasta dishes. The sauce was AMAZING, it is very flavorful and seems to be saffron based.  The seafood was very fresh, which is quite a rarity when eating out and reflects their attentiveness in sourcing ingredients.  It is also very reasonably priced.  To be honest, it was really out of my expectations.  I later read from other reviews that the chef is from Pasta Brava - that explains it.  Also read that its owner is the same as Ice Edge Cafe, a popular cafe in Kovan (ok too far for me so good they open one in TB). I tried a piece of the pizza that my friend was having, the crust was pretty good too.  The pasta was really filling as the sauce was so rich, so I didn't have any room for desserts.   That is a pity though as they appears to serve a great selection of gelatos.   I read that they have a 1-for-1 pasta deal during weekday lunch time and that's a pretty good deal, I would totally take advantage of this if I work around Tiong Bahru.  This is a pretty big space and can accommodate any group dining comfortably."

I don't see where it's 'hip' or 'ster'.Food is average. Mushroom soup is not Campbell's. Or at least to my un-hipster taste buds. Buffalo wings were like sweet and sour chicken wings, not spicy. Pasta was meh. The only thing I would come back for are the pizzas, Super thin crust and light. Nice.Ambience is homely. Lots of wood benches and tin pails for decoration. Seats are tightly packed and walk space is narrow. I might have seen a mason jar or two. /shudder""Will I come back?"" Yes, for the pizza and for the ""buy 1 get one free"" lunch special. Now the mechanics of this BOGO is dreadfully complicated and very sneaky if the customer is not careful. I will explain this in the next section. This would have been so easy to fix when asked, and would have won a life-long customer. But. hey, which restaurant manager would want to do that?Service is non-existent. Poor guys are overworked and do not have time for pleasantries. Price. Ahhh, the only thing this place has going for it is the 1 for 1 lunch special. When you get seated, you will see from the menu that not all items qualify for this. Items that do, have a little label next to it.So! Imagine the following scenario:Ah Beng and Ah Lian decide to try this new 'simi-lai eh hipster' cafe near Ah Mah's flat in Tiong Bahru.They order two muchroom soups ($11 for 2) This items is automatically 1 for 1. Don't know why they have to make life so confusing.Then Ah Beng orders a Vogole pasta MAIN for $18. Ah Lian orders a Funghi Pizza for $18.For appetisers, Ah Beng orders Buffalo Wings ($16) and Ah Lian orders Calamari Rings ($16).So, quick recap: 2 soups, 2 mains, 2 appetisers.QUESTION: How much was Ah Beng and Ah Lian charged for their lunch? (Assume no service charge.)ANSWER: You would think, this is easy! 1 for 1 mushroom soup + 1 for 1 MAIN + 1 for 1 appetiser = $11 + $18 + $16 = $45Wrong. Because Chapter 55 is so scared that customers will 'take advantage' of the 1 for 1 deal, this is how they calculated the bill:Mushroom soup is $11 for 2. (Written in the menu, don't argue.)Higher cost items are charged, lower cost items are free. (Written in the fine print, don't argue.)Actual bill is: $11 + $18 + $18 = $47Ah Beng and Ah Lian pays up and leaves, vowing to never come back and also something about mothers and fathers.Ok, ok, the story is a little dramatic for a difference of $2. But it is the principle of the whole thing. Even if it is not for principle, then it is about making a quick decision to make Ah Lian and Ah Beng happy customers. Long story short: After the trauma of mathematics and Chapter 55. Ah Beng and Ah Lian grew closer and lived happily ever after,"

Having had work in the area before, its one of the few decent food options available by that hour. Word of advice though for those who drive, good luck finding parking. And when business is brisk, good luck finding a table too. As the name states, they are famous for their porridge. Every possible kind with every possible ingredients / toppings is available here. Called me a traditionalist, but I often go with the staple Pork porridge with century egg. I like the portion sizes especially after a long day at work or play for you clubbers out there. As with most supper porridge stalls, they also serve frog legs porridge. And for those of you who irk at the thought of eating kermit, I will tell you the same thing my parents told me when I was a kid squirming at the very same idea, ""It tastes the same as chicken, only much nicer!"". Its really true as frog meat is lighter and sweeter in texture, and the flavours goes into making the porridge sweet and light too.And for more variety sake, they also serve a very good standard bbq chicken wings and also raw fish (chinese style not japanese sashimi) to go with plain porridge if thats your cup of tea."

I don't think I could ever get tired of either of these dishes. It can get pretty crowded, and you may have to wait a while for tables on a busy night. They have more tables at another outlet besides the small provision shop, so take a walk down that way if the main area on New Bridge road is full.

It's really hard to get Pork Satay and I remember lovin' it in Bali - when I had Pork Satay almost every other day - so it was a pleasant surprise to mix and match, Chicken, Pork and Lamb Satay - and the marinade is really yummy. The Satay turned out great and the peanut sauce was excellent too.What I Love: Service was great - the guy who took my order was a young chap, and was eloquent, and did the satay pretty quickly. Ketupat is free, when you order 10 pieces. You will get Ketupat, since minimum order is 10 pieces anyway. The meat was tender, tasted great, and flavors were just yummalicious! It's great to have satay, drink Coconut Juice, and sit out, looking at all the colorful lanterns. Great ambiance. What I Don't Love: Absolutely nothing!"

We were nearby during its official launch last Friday, so of course, we have to drop by and see (out of curiosity). I was expecting a long queue but to my surprise, there wasn't! We were there around 9-ish. There were over-enthusiastic staff cheering and screaming and giving high fives as we were walking in, I thought I was there to buy an iPhone for a split second. LOL. Queueing up to order was a breeze as there were 4 counters and at least 30 staff in the kitchen churning out burgers, fries, ""concretes"" and milkshakes so efficiently. Very impressive. The wait was manageable, around 20 mins for our order. There was also staff on the dining floor assisting customers with any queries, passing them cutleries, interacting with kids and basically being a great ambassador to the brand. The dining area is big and spacious enough with lots of seating booths, tall tables, and plants. Now onto the burgers - I tried various burgers from Shake Shack before, so I decided to try Chick'nShack. Delicious chicken breast slow-cooked in buttermilk marinate and then fried to perfection served with lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk mayo. Good stuff. We also tried the ""concretes"" - a term used for frozen custard blended with mix-ins. The Shack Attack is the regular cant-go-wrong chocolate mix, but my new found favorite will have to be Eye of the Tiger which is vanilla custard blend with lychee and top with lime zest. Refreshing and not too heavy on the palate. Overall, a pleasant visit and first-time experience at the new Shake Shack branch in the city. I can't wait to be back soon!"

You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center."

And the food and wine are both good and at a ""reasonable"" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The ""house wine"" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!"

I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal."

French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly."

The fam joined us for night 2, and we had a lovely booth to ourselves.Food was not an easy pick - there is a lot to choose from, and almost all of it sounded lovely! Over the two nights, we had loads: the cassolette of escargot was super tasty, especially with the garlicky mushrooms; the mackerel fillet was light, and the accompaniments added great balance (thumbs up for the dressing!); the lamb rack, pork trotter, boeuf bourguigon, and roasted chicken leg?

You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center."

And the food and wine are both good and at a ""reasonable"" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The ""house wine"" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!"

I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal."

French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly."

The waiters were all dressed up and the warm lighting inside with tables tightly packed were quintessentially Parisian. The menu did not disappoint. Good old classics like Coq Au Vin, Confit de Canard, Escargots and Soupe a l'Oignon got me excited. The mackerel salad had caught my eye as I remember a rather delicious variant when I was visiting the French Countryside. I went with that, as well as the Poulet Rotî ( Orast Chicken) for my main course.The Mackerel Fillet marinated in white wine with scented potatoes salad had been so stunning, that was all I could think of since then. The perfumed salad had a light floral and earthy taste, possibly the doing of a herb infused oil. The fish was not the least fishy and it was delicate and soft, marrying perfectly with the potatoes that were lightly dressed. The greens and garnishing herbs were light in flavour not too overpowering, lending a great touch to the delicate textures of the dish. The main course were impressive, enough to leave an impression and a longing to be back.I manage to catch a glimpse of the lunch menu that seemed very economical at just $30 for three course.

The soup soaked up the essence of the dish.Milo Bun with Red Bean Filling 美禄豆沙包 (S$5.80/ 3 pcs) Interesting having bun with skin made with milo powder, but I felt that the filling was more interesting as it tasted different from the usual type and had sesame seeds in it to give it more texture on the otherwise smooth filling.Crispy Pancakes 糖酥饼 (S$3.50/ 3 pieces)The pancakes were freshly made, crispy and light, without been too oily or too sweet.Traditional Pan Fried Bun Stuffed with Pork 傅統生煎包 (S$5/ 3 pieces)The bun was encased with thin skin with juicy filling inside.Wealth Dumpling 百財水餃Pork & Cabbage 猪肉白菜馅 (S$4/ 6 pieces, S$6/ 10 pieces) Similarly thin skin with juicy filling.Pan Fried Dumplings 锅贴 (S$6.80)Similar to the dumplings, but it came with light crispy base.Papaya Jelly 木瓜凍 (S$5.80)The coconut jelly was freshly made daily with rock sugar in limited amount, instead of the common castor sugar. The jelly was firm without been too sweet, and stick to the fruit nicely.Overall the food was delicious and well priced. The staffs were knowledgeable about its dishes."

Was taken here by local colleagues for lunch as I had heard and read quite a bit about the local Singapore cuisine that had sprung up when long ago the Chinese and Malay folks had intermarried and created a new local ethnicity (also called Nonya, i believe) and a way of cooking that melded the Malay curry cooking with traditional Chinese food elements.I put myself in the hands of my colleagues and thanks to them, got to experience an amazing range of starters, mains and desserts! The Assam Prawns were so good - lots of tamarind mixed with palm sugar and just balanced right for that sweet-sour taste. The Ayam Buah Keluak was another delight in each bite - the black nut had this amazing filling that i just could have kept eating all day long. We also got a vegetarian mushroom dish (I can't remember what its was called, but again, just delicious) as well as this dish of Chinese noodles swimming in a wonderful seafood sauce with tons of calamari and baby octopus (yum! yum! yum!). I totally over-ate and wished had a 2nd stomach - only being the company of work colleagues stopped me from licking the plate, it really was that good.Since there's always room for dessert, we got Ubi Kayu, which is a soft sago ball rolled into fresh coconut flakes - just so delicious, and prefect way to end meal. End Verdict?? I would so totally go here again!"

Ingredients easily found in China were not so readily available while in this part of the world, so local ingredients had to be utilized. Cooking with local Malay ingredients in a Chinese style and voilà, an early form of Asian Fusion cuisine was born.Cozy little restaurant that seats 28-30 people I'm guessing. The interior decor was designed to give that authentic shophouse style feel with just enough decorations and colors to tell you that you're definitely not in a Chinese restaurant. It's not uber-chic like Violet Oon's Kitchen but neither are the prices. Unfortunately, there was a large (and loud) table of diners next to us and made our dinner a bit uncomfortable, but at no fault to the restaurant.We had a very nice first experience trying the Peranakan cuisine. There was so much more I had wanted to try but with just 3 people dining, we just couldn't do it. The dish portions were not very large which made it great for sharing and offered a good way to try more dishes with smaller dining parties. I don't know if it's just the style of cuisine but the dishes came out of the kitchen lukewarm or more like room temp. It didn't matter because the heat from the spices made up for it! We tried Ngoh Hiang, Beef Rendang, Babi Pongteh, Garam Assam Snapper, Chap Chye, (and some others I forgot). The Babi Pongteh was a little weird because there were small bits of bones and cartilage in the meat, so it was not a very nice feel in the mouth, although the sauce it came in was nice. So the food was very good and definitely unique in taste, but as a friend suggested when I said we were having Peranakan, everything starts tasting the same after a few dishes. So my suggestion is to try to order dishes that spreads out along the taste spectrum (i.e., spicy, tangy, sweeter, etc.). A welcomed unique cuisine that offers so much more that what we experienced today. Will be back to try the other menu items."

The food ,although in limited proportions was quite tasty. Of particular to mention was beef rendang, fish head curry and long beans Sambal.

I felt a bit lightheaded and my leg muscles were starting to feel painful. We had initially planned to eat at the hawker center but decided we needed AC. this place was small, quiet and super cool inside. We ordered the fish head curry, rice and chop chye. The curry was really really spicy but in a great way with mustard seed and chili and beans and eggplant. I think the spices revived me. The chop chye was decent and had some sweetness that countered the heat from the curry. In order to cool off afterwards I had the tapioca balls with coconut ice cream and palm sugar which reminded me of the yummy desserts I had in Bangkok. The hub ordered something with durian purée on it for the experience. He said it tasted like a rotten sweet garlic. Anyhow the prices at this place were worth it - the curry was 23$ and more than enough for us to share. Anyhow after lunch I felt much more normal and ready to face the heat again outside."

The fish and chips were suprisingly good, not dry and mushy like how it can get. As you cut the fish, it slices into ""flakes"" which told me ""yes this fish is fresh! The vanilla icecream was delicious too. It wasn't just like your normal off the shelf supermarket type ice cream like how i expected.

One of it had thai basil leaves which was damn tasty! Both sausages were juicy and weren't drowned in sauce. For her dessert she had the fresh donut with a side of salted caramel creme.

My team and I had lotsa Chinese food during this festivity, we wanted something different for a change. That's when one of my team suggested to go to ""the study"" as she had been there and had some glowing reviews about the food. ""The Study"" features British comfort food, or so they say... We were about to find out. Have to warn you though... Parking is rather difficult as the restaurant is located in quite a snazzy hot spot where both locals and tourists frequent for food and drinks. Best if you drive up along Neil road to get a spot at the public parking lots, cos if there isn't, you get another chance around Bukit pasoh. Otherwise, just take the MRT, nearest station is at Outram. Restaurant is located nearby with a short walking distance.""The Study"" is a small, cosy restaurant with approximately 40s seats, and styled with modern retro English deco. You have the kitchen within the space of the restaurant where you can get a good view of the talented chefs preparing food. Totally love the vibe!Our order for the evening included:Starters:1. Heirloom Tomato salad with truffle burrata- I totally love this dish! The tomatoes were sweet/sour and was the perfect partner in crime for the truffle burrata. I love how you get the light, refreshing taste of the tomato first then your tongue tastes the truffle burrata, where it starts to fill it with the creaminess of the burrata. That experience is really quite awesome. The only gripe for me was that there was not enough burrata on the plate and I wanted the entire plate to myself! 2. Iberico Pork and Foie Gras scotched egg- This dish was just so beautiful to look at! To me this was something new and it really had an awesome taste to it. The Iberico pork with foie gras somehow tasted like the less salty version of minced spam. I could not taste the foie gras at all which made me slightly disappointed. The crust was crisp and complemented the dish well. To me this dish was yummy but if the chef can do something to bring out the taste of the foie gras it would have been perfect.Mains:3. Baked sea bass with truffled gnocchi- My colleague ordered this. The fish was pan fried to crispy goodness and the gnocchi was al dente. Again, I could not taste the truffle on the gnocchi. Otherwise this is a rather satisfying healthy dish. 4. Roasted lamb loin with Yorkshire pudding -  I asked for medium, but it came out medium to well, causing the lamb to be rather hard. To me this dish wasn't memorable. It was ok to taste but I wouldn't order again. 5. Beef rump steak with crispy shallot rings -  In my opinion, this dish is the restaurant's true signature. The beef that was cooked medium rare (don't worry it's not bloody) and was superbly tender. Definitely a must order! Dessert:6. Doughnuts with cinnamon sugar and salted Caramel cream- OMG! This is a must order! The doughnuts are fried till crispy perfection, the outer layer crisp with cinnamon sugar and the inside dough is buttery soft and fluffy. The salted caramel cream is super light and very Delish! And when eaten together, Pls don't be surprised if you find yourself doing the happy dance! 7. Vanilla cheesecake with ginger crumble and raspberry sorbet- After you have tried the doughnuts, everything else pales in comparison. Hehe... Ok but to be fair, this was not bad. But it would have been better if the chef was able to bring out the taste of the vanilla. I tasted more cheese than I did the vanilla.So was this comfort food to me? I can't say for sure. There were some unique dishes which I very much enjoyed but there were some misses as well. Additionally for what each dish was worth (pricey), the portions were also a tad small even by a lady's standards. That said, this is still a pretty good restaurant to hang with your friends after work for food and drinks. I too will return to try their other dishes. Ps. Please make reservations in advance to avoid disappointment."

After a few hits (the hawkers market) and misses (the white rabbit), the Study really really impressed. We booked early on New Year's Eve. Grabbing a couple seats by the bar we had full interaction with Chef Ayo and his staff. Coming early probably helped as we saw all of their early prep and were able to watch through the night the way they prepared as well as watching the chef schooling his crew in some of the finer points of service. Chef regaled us with stories of his background and we had a great discussion about knives and his use of lamb fat!  I was impressed as we sat down to some roots manuva blasting away followed by a greatest hits of 90s hip hop. A perfect way to set the Eve tone. We shared the scotch egg and heirloom tomato salad. Both were excellent. Tomatoes in this part of the world are hard to find. These were fine set off by some excellent frisée and truffled burrata. The scotch egg was as advertised. Held together by a juicy pork exterior. Clearly a signature dish. Next up was the special : turkey with bread sauce. My step mom with her UK heritage waist fascinated by tiebreaks sauce with was tasty bright and set off the sous-vide turkey perfectly. My lamb was excellent - cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The only disappointment was the leek, kale and pine nut side. A bit limp and watery. Finally ended with a very creamy rice pudding and tasty mango sorbet. Excellent unobtrusive service and access to their fun speakeasy next door. Highly recommend.

For the record, I waited approximately 2 hrs and 30 mins before my turn. I still find it amazing how bak kwa is a such a prized commodity during CNY. Customers from Hong Kong and Malaysia can be easily found among the Singaporeans buying kilos and kilos as gifts for relatives. Yet It is not hard to understand why because the bak kwa definitely lives up to its reputation. Soft, tender and flavourful. Not greasy or tough and filled with fat like other commercial brands (i.e. Bee Cheng Hiang and Frangrance).  Once you tried it, you wont want any of the cheaper options.For those of you who have been hiding under a rock or just plain ignorant yet think highly of themselves, they have 3 shops in Singapore. The main and best is the one along New Bridge Road just beside Pagoda St near the MRT. Yes, thats the main one.

That's probably why I've learnt to associate claypot rice with nighttime fare. Try consuming it in the afternoon in our climate without disintegrating into a puddle of sweat... confirm heatstroke lor.The reason why Lian He Ben Ji's claypot rice is a cut above its competitors is precisely because it doesn't compromise on cooking time and ingredient quality. Each pot of rice is steamed for 5 minutes, after which ingredients are added and the pot left to sit over a blazing charcoal flame for the next 20 minutes. That guarantees you a minimum 25-minute wait per order, which can stretch to a waiting time of 45 minutes during peak dining periods. To get around the wait, regular diners know to call to place their orders in advance. Unfortunately we weren't as savvy.Was the wait worth it? Abso friggin' lutely.Mixed claypot rice, $10 for a portion that feeds two - After drizzling some sweet soya sauce over the rice and mixing everything together, the first spoonful of rice I had can only be described as a flavour explosion. The pieces of chicken were succulent, the lup cheong (Chinese sausages) and waxed meat firm and juicy, but the rice - the rice was in a realm of its own. You just have to taste it to know that charcoal makes one hell of a difference in cooking this dish. The rice in the claypot was smoky yet fluffy, and when drenched in sweet sauce was just... wow. We kept mumbling ""so good, this is so good"" in between mouthfuls of rice. It got even better when our spoons hit the bottom of the pot, where burnt rice, or what we call guo ba (锅巴), was clinging to the sides, just waiting to be scraped off.And the chilli! The chilli here is the bomb okay. It was spicy, sour and caused beads of sweat to form on my temples, but I kept going back for more.To be fair, the slivers of salted fish in the rice could have been less mushy. Plus the soup (lotus root with pork ribs) and stir-fried veggies we ordered were very average. But who really cares? It's a hawker centre, and there're about 50 other stalls if you must have your sides to complement this... claypot of perfection.Now into its second generation of owners, Lian He Ben Ji is an established business that started off as a roadside stall in the same area back in 1979. The founder of the stall handed the reins over to his daughter-in-law, which I think is a really heartwarming tidbit of news in a society that unfortunately still tends toward the patriarchal. The daughter-in-law now runs the stall with her two younger sisters, which is why this place is also known fondly as ""3 sisters' claypot rice"".Lian He Ben Ji gets my seal of approval for their dedication to their craft. I'll definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know."

Wrong choice, each claypot is big enough for two servings each and we ended up leaving the second pot hardly touched.

They also serve the softest pork belly and tastiest kimchi jjigae I've had in Singapore yet. Let's talk banchan. Their kimchi is fresh and is one of the most legit batch around town. The seasoned bean sprouts were salty yet yummy. The seasoned anchovies were the saltiest and must be accompanied with something bland (ie: steamed egg, rice or wraps). The fish cakes were mild while the potato salad was slightly sweet and perfectly soft like mashed potato. While other K-restaurants tend to serve bland side dishes, Superstar K isn't shy to make their banchan take the spotlight. I thoroughly enjoyed the signature King Galbi due to its just-enough-chewiness and not-too-sweet marinade, however my foodie partner preferred the sweet marinated short ribs from Han Kook Gwan more (they were also fresher). To each man his own. We both agreed that the Kimchi Jjigae is one of the most delicious and flavorful we've tried in Singapore. It is like the ones served in Los Angeles' Koreatown. Spicy yet in a sophisticated way. Typically Korean restaurants play Kpop music videos on their television screen. At Superstar K, it's ""Wreck It Ralph"" on replay. I love that movie, but my eyes prefer to feast on Kpop while eating K-food! And if I were eating Indian food, I'd want to watch Bollywood films not Cinderella. Verdict: I'd come back to Superstar K for their Pork Belly, King Galbi and Kimchi Jjigae. And you should, too. However I give a C for Ventilation (my hair smelled of KBBQ for the rest of the night up until I woke up in the next morning). But I'd still go back for the King Galbi again and again :D"

I usually go for two servings of the unseasoned beef ribs, the meat is very high quality and there is no need to drench it in seasonings and mask the flavor. The waitresses grill the beef for you at the table. Each table is fixed in position and can fit from 1 - 6 or so people. They bring fresh charcoal to grill the meat before the meal.You also get a free steamed egg dish with your meal. Basically a steaming pot overflowing with egg is delivered to your table soon after you place your order. It looks intimidatingly large, but it is light and serves as a good appetizer. Another winning dish is the cold noodles in chilled broth, which comes in a huge silver mixing bowl complete with thin slices of beef and a boiled egg inside. Vinegar and mustard are provided to adjust for taste. It's a nice contrast to the heavier beef dishes to end the meal.No reservations and the place is popular, so you will probably be looking at a wait if you go during peak eating hours. No worries though, put your number down, grab a beer nearby and they'll give you a buzz when your table is ready. 20-30 minutes wait is common."

This store is pretty small so there will be a wait list if you come during the weekends. The parking was difficult as there are other restaurants and pubs nearby. Sitting outside while waiting for your table might make you sick of smelling the cigarette smells. The downside of waiting till you are seated is when most of your party have not arrive. They will only give you a table when most of the people in your party has arrived. The maximum amount for a party is 10.This place served a lot of side dishes (kimchi, steamed egg, bean sprouts, anchovies, potato salad and sliced fish cakes). All of them are extremely delicious!! The taste, the texture are in perfect blend. You will at least ask for two rounds for the side dishes.My party ordered pork belly, chicken and cubed beef. It was delicious!! The waitress will help you flip the meat and put on new batch of meat after you are done with it. The customer service was good here.Overall, I like this restaurant and will be back for more with different batch of friends. It is highly encouraged if you use public transport instead of driving there yourselves. Like I mentioned earlier, parking was terrible. Enjoy your delicacy here :) Cheers!!"

Bold choice but there we go.We got a larger table in the centre of the restaurant after a small ""discussion"" with one of the waiters as he wanted to place us behind the entrance door and argued that he might need the bigger tables later on when they get busy. As I had a table reserved - hinting that it was our anniversary - I had expected something else than the back of the entrance, thus I did not like that part of the evening especially when, later on, lots of tables became available.The evening got much better after that as we started with Prosecco, parmigiana and octopus - and their amuse bouche which was a lovely bruschetta.For mains we ordered tagliatelle with lobster and pasta with mussels and fish roe, and had a wonderful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to drink.It all tasted very fine and very authentic - I loved the fact that most employees spoke Italian and that Italian music was blaring from the speakers. Only the interior could benefit from a bit more ""love"", like tablecloth and candles. It all seems a bit too rustic for my taste, as if ""unfinished"".The dessert - a delectable Tiramisu - was the perfect ending, with some Limoncello on the house.

Champagne long ribs - this is one of their most popular dish and it was a great balance between salty and sweet. The meat was slightly tough to chew/burnt at the ends but the middle was tender and juicy Fried rice - we were originally going to order the medium one but the waitress suggested the small one since she said that would be enough. She was right! The small rice is enough to comfortably feed at least three people. Cray fish cooked in garlic sauce - this was an in season dish suggested by the waitress. The cray fish was very very fresh - the meat peeled off the shell easily and was a great addition to the other two dishes we ordered. All in all we had a positive experience. The waitress was very nice and helped us order the perfect amount of food. The food was way larger portions than expected ( we were expecting small portions based on the menu photos) everything had great flavor. Highly recommended!

This is my personal favorite.  If you don't really like tofu, this might even make you a believer.   Ok, maybe not, but definitely worth a try.Cereal prawns.  They're prawns, so they're not petite.  Make sure to squeeze the heads out like toothpaste tubes for all that additional goodness.Stir fry veggies.  They do one with a vegetable like an endive.  With hot garlic...just the thing.  Crunchy with just that little spicy vegetal kick.  So good."

We had the lotus seed duck (lian2 zi3 ya1) - an off menu item that the waitress kept pushing (saying it was very popular and tasty and only available on Friday to Sunday). When we ate the dish at the restaurant, we found that there was a lot of stuffing - lots of yam, chestnut,  carrots, leeks - and virtually no duck. When we brought the rest home we found more duck - but this shows that the serving style/orientation of the duck is poor and doesn't give you a good balance of duck and stuffing. And at $52 it was expensive too.The house tofu (zao1 pai2 dou4 fu4) was okay - the tofu was silky and smooth tofu but the sauce was a very pedestrian brown sauce. Since it is ""招牌"" (""house speciality"") tofu I was expecting much more.We also had champagne pork ribs, which were not very crispy. The sauce was uninspired, and the taste also didn't penetrate all the way through.Although the place was really crowded, the food still came very fast. So I suspect the kitchen was taking shortcuts, which might've explained the food quality.We were also seated in the overflow area - outside with no fans.

The restaurant itself is pretty small with only about seven tables or so inside, but there are many tables outside some of which spill into the parking lot.We went with some friends that live in Singapore and eat here on a somewhat regular basis so service was pretty good compared to what I've read elsewhere.The meal started with some peanuts, which were kind of oily.There were vegetables topped with crushed peanuts with a slight bit of chili but nothing overpowering.The fried tofu is one of the house specialties. The tofu was soft and creamy on the inside with a nice firm texture on the outside.The Calamari with Salted Egg crust was a favorite among the table, but I'm not a fan of salted eggs so this was one I personally did not enjoy.The Cereal Prawns are prawns that are lightly battered and then deep fried whole, with the shell and head on. It is then topped with a cereal mixture which is reminiscent of Captain Crunch. The cereal is very sweet, almost too much in that is sort of detracts from the taste of the prawns.The Steamed Fish is topped with cilantro and green onions in a soy sauce based sauce. The fish was nicely cooked and remained moist and tender. The fish is delicate in nature. This is a nice, clean dish which isn't very heavy.The Singapore Chili Crab was a large crab which was full of meat, especially the claws. The sauce is tomato based and was somewhat sweet and not at all hot. The dish is very messy, but what good food isn't? The dish comes with bread that is perfect for sopping up the sauce.The overall meal at Por Kee Eating House was very enjoyable.

My recommendation is the porridge called ""OJIYA"" in Japan. After we eat Thai style fish hot pot (Sea bass or Soon Hock, etc. any fish can lah), request staff to bring 3 raw eggs, chopped green onion and cooked Indica rice. Then pour the rice in the pot, boil about 10 minutes. Once the rice become softer, add eggs and green onion, wait a few minutes then ready to eat. This way is Japanese traditional culture. Some staffs might reject to bring items for the porridge. Then try to request with Chinese language."

Another famous dish is the Thai-style fish. The soup is very refreshing and you won't be able to stop drinking it. It's not overwhelmingly spicy nor garlicky, but it just struck the perfect balance to me.I also like their champagne ribs. You can get the individual portions which is 1 long rib per person, or the group version, where the ribs are chopped off to smaller pieces. Both are equally good.Don't forget to order dessert too. They serve killer mango pudding and yam paste."

I think the flavors were good, but the cooks have a terribly heavy hand with the oil. every dish was just a bit too oily, even the vegetables, which left you with a greasy feel on the mouth - rather off-putting to me. I'm a little fastidious about this - so everything ended up getting a dip through a bowl of hot tea.we'd return more frequently if the dishes were less oil-slippery, the meat less fatty - as it is, there are cze char places out there with a lighter hand in cooking, and similarly expert flavors. so, this place, I'm going to deem as divisive - I certainly can't begrudge the flavors here, and the cooking style could be right up your alley.reservations definitely needed, and it's a good place for family. if you find eating next to the carpark (with parking cars and the sometimes whiff of exhaust) uninteresting - make sure you let them know when you call."

I much prefer being delivered the right amount of food rather than too much. We ordered from the prix fixe menu which is quite reasonable at $22 or so SGD. My wife had meatballs with fettuccine in a marinara sauce, chicken broth soup with vegetable (quite fresh, I might add). I had chicken in a panang curry sauce along with a delicious salad with marvelous, fresh and copious amounts of fungus on top. The dressing was sesame, soy, olive oil and a bit of sugar/sweetener -- excellent. The wine I ordered by the glass - a French merlot - complemented perfectly. We shared a side of spinach with egg which was also quite fresh. If they retain their demand for fresh ingredients coupled with their ingenuity for flavor combination and balancing, they should continue to succeed.Overall a very good experience at Eight.

The drinks and wine selection here is amazing. They give good recommendations and their food options are cool - it's French/Asian Fusion and Mediterranean.What I Love: What I ordered, the Duck Wasabi Salad, was to die for. It's hard to get really good salad, especially when it's Duck. For this salad, the flavours blended perfectly. My friend ordered the Laksa Pasta, and another had a steak. No of us complained.What I Don't Love: The prices. This place is pretty chi chi and nice, and a dinner there (plus drinks) would set you back $40 to $60 per person.

I LOVE the nanban. Freshly fried with some lettuce within, with an awesome tartar sauce. I should have gotten two nanbunsss. The salted egg shrimp was okay - could have been better if the shrimp was deep fried and the sauce could actually coat the shrimp, instead of dripping everywhere.

Instead of keeping the similar type of decoration, the Bao Makers stripped everything to white. From the outside the café stood out quite well due to the colour. On the inside, they also kept the minimalistic industrial look with the cemented walls and wooden furnitures, perfect for hipsters to hangout. We visited the Bao Makers on the last day of our holiday when we were quite full from our previous dinner, but at the back of my mind I always remembered my conversation with Em that I'd go and try the bao at this place. So without further contemplation I dragged hubby in and ordered two baos, the chili crab and Korean bulgogi pork. I like both but the succulent and spicy chili crab definitely delivered more flavour especially with the crispy golden bao. I really like the idea of infusing the local dish into the bao, something that I never seen before at other places. The filling for both baos were sufficient. Since Hubby was craving for dessert he also ordered a pretty serving of lemon meringue sundae. The meringue came as the topping in the shape of rose, the rest of the ingredients were lemon sponge, lemon curd and vanilla ice cream with almond slices. It was delicious but a bit awkward to be called a sundae except if you break the meringue and the sponge cake, then mix the whole thing together with the ice cream.  We had a good time at the Bao Makers and we hope they will be a one stop shop for bao and able to come up with a lot of different fillings next time we go to Singapore."

You'll need  at least 2 to fill you up (they also require a min of 2 baos per order). So a meal here will set you up for more than $10. Aside from the price, the taste doesn't quite make the cut. While the nanban chicken (fried chicken) is nicely fried and served out piping hot and crispy, the marinate on the chicken doesn't come through and there is also too much mayo with the tiny piece of chicken.The chilli crab bun is a take on a Singaporean favorite. While it is full of real shredded crabs, the accompanying sauce is a diluted chilli liquid that has nothing of the usual eggy crabby gravy of a good chilli crab sauce. Place is typically hipster with nice simple decor but the taste and value of the food is not enough to bring me back."

I didn't read the review or find out about more this cafe as I wanted to get an element of surprise and I did! The cafe is quite spacious as there is good amount of privacy between you and the other customers. If you are in a big group (around 6-10), you be pleased to know there is a Long table and if needed, they just add a table or two. Perfect for some catching up as its quiet and not crowded for most of the time, according to another Yelper. Orders are self service and free wifi is available but you have to ask the staff for the password. It would be nice if they could leave the password either on the table or on the receipt. Staff were friendly and more importantly no sign of impatience or pressure to leave the cafe even though the group had finish the food for quite some time and got lost in the wonderful conversation. I ordered the Namban Chicken and Classic (check my photo of the menu for more information) and I find them to be my liking for my taste bud. Not the best but decent enough for me to make another trip back to try out the other flavours. Prices is reasonable and portion is definitely value for money.

Lastly, their truffle fries were a bit on the salty side, but full of cheesy truffley goodness. Besides the food, the decor is right up my alley. Clean and modern, wide open spaces and gray and brown accents. Service was super fast, which is another big plus with places that have small menus.

Being at a Bao place. You've got to try the baos right? so i went straight for the shrimp with salted egg yolk one. The bummer was that it was a minimum order of 2 baos, and i really had wanted to sit down and relax and not stuff myself with 2 baos. But i understand the procedure as steaming just one bao would be quite a waste of steam i suppose. so i had to go for the traditional one. The classic ""kong bak"" bao/pork belly. The shrimp one could do with a more stronger salted egg yolk sauce, but all in all, the shrimp was fresh and crisp. As for the pork belly bao, it would be nice if it had a thicker sauce around the meat. The staff here are friendly and would go the extra mile to help. So the next time you're around horne road or going to catch a soccer match at the jalan besar stadium. Come over and get yourself a great cup of coffee and some baos.

It was also filling and I just had one piece of that for dinner. When I was about to leave, I bought the lemon meringue. It wasn't as good as I thought it will be as I consumed it hours later. The second time I came, I had the Raspberry Croissant. The server also heat it up before serving. I asked for a to go bag (brown bag) so that I am able to taste the croissant in bites instead of using fork and knife. The raspberry filling was so amazing. On top of the croissant there were powdered sugar and almond which made it sweet and crunchy. The texture of the flakes was just done perfectly. Service was excellent. The servers will repeat the order of what you are getting one more time for accuracy. They also greet you upon entering this cafe. Every time I come here, people also started to rush inside here to buy other kinds of breads or pastries. They also serve main courses as well as soups. Definitely a good place to hang out during the rainy days or during tea time. Will be back for more soon :)"

It's the smell of butter and sugar probably, both of which i cannot resist and that resulted in a shopping spree when i stumbled into Bread and Hearth, a new artisanal bakery in the Keong Saik/ Chinatown/ Ann Siang area. Bread and Hearth prides themselves with using pure butter and quality ingredient. There is absolutely no shortening used, as highlighted by the friendly staff. French Normandy butter and flour goes into making these quality pastries.The Matcha Orange is a bread roll with a nice matcha fragrance and the flavor is lifted by the refreshing chunky orange peel. The Honey Chocolate bread ($3) was porous and very bouncy. Even though it said Honey Chocolat, it wasn't sweet at all and it actually had a salty taste. That said, i still like how it was flavored nicely with the dark chocolate chip bits. Do add some honey to it after you toast it. I swear it's divine.The Bacon Focaccia ($6.50) is exactly that kinda bread that i'd want for a breakfast. The fragrance was taunting me during work the whole afternoon and i finally succumbed to my weakness and took several bites and boy was it satisfying. It's the perfect savory snack. I would eat the foccacia even if it didn't have bacon on it. The Cream Cheese Sesame ($2.80) turned out to be a sweet treat instead of a savory one! Think dense creamy cheese with a nice sweet pastry crust peppered with smokey sesame seeds. Yummy! Another must try is the Bostock which is more than 50% cake i swear. Bread and Hearth also does sandwiches and coffee and they do have a nice enough spot for lunch/tea."

But being someone who's open to trying new things, I figured I might as well see what the fuss is about.Ah Chiang's has been around for decades, but I'll leave it to the reviews below to talk about its history. When I visited during my lunch break, the place was hopping with locals, both professionals and those who are retired and probably live around the block. Since it's difficult to find a table during peak lunch hour, my colleagues and I did a takeaway order this time around.  The aunties that run the cashier can be a bit brusque, but don't take it personally. Also, if you do takeaway, don't take it personally when they call a number, you know it's not your order, but then they glare at you thinking it is your order, and then when you prove to them it isn't, they start yelling amongst themselves trying to figure out whether a guest isn't listening or if someone on the staff is an idiot for taking the wrong order.I decided to play it safe by just ordering the plain pork porridge (I think it's the 2nd or 3rd one on the menu) which doesn't include intestines, liver or anything your typical Westerner wouldn't eat. Once I got back to the office and tried it (in an air conditioned environment) I didn't think it was half bad. I will have to echo the other reviews in that it is pretty plain, so it's best to take my colleague's advice of adding soy sauce, ginger, and pepper for more taste.However, the price can't be beat. If you include the extra charge for takeaway, it came out to $4.25, and I was unable to finish my bowl."

I've returned for 2 times and counting ever since!One of my colleagues and I always order their pork balls porridge, which is THE BEST of the lot. Also, chinese sashimi (raw fish) is a pretty acquired taste and way more fishy than the Japanese version but the thin slithers of raw fish in soy sauce were good and went well with the porridge! Go for the more expensive version if you can though. We also had some fried fish skin once, which was very salty on its own but nice when eaten alternately with porridge.(I daresay that this place actually rivals the more popular Zhen Zhen porridge at Maxwell... probably my favourite porridge place in Singapore at the moment)Haven't been here for awhile as my workplace has changed but I'll come back here regularly when I'm posted for work near the area!"

Add extra soy sauce, smother it in pepper, and you're good to go.They're also really popular for their other dishes like their tofu in Thai-like chili sauce, their raw fish (that I confess I've never dared to try), and a few other things that I've noticed other people ordering but never really felt like indulging.The porridge though is solid. It's hearty, nourishing, and when hot, thick. Once it cools down it does get kinda watery, so do try to eat it fast for maximum enjoyment. Taking away costs extra, but gives the raw egg a little extra time to cook (as long as you're not carrying it too far away) for that perfect soft boiled consistency.The soya milk is a bit on the overly sweet side, so I don't really recommend it... but if you like sweet then.

The were benches outside for waiting and an organised queue system which eased the wait. We had the banana bread ($15) which had been widely raved about by many bloggers and cafe goers. The bread was soft and moist and paired well with the yogurt and nuts, but was nothing extraordinary and was a bit steep for its price tag of $15. A plus point would be that it was not too sweet and hence rather easy on the palate. For dessert, the sticky date pudding was a pleasant end to the meal. In fact, I'd say skip the banana bread and have this instead. The sticky date pudding pairs well with the vanilla bean ice cream and the degree of sweetness depends on the amount of syrup you choose to dip your pudding in. Warm and sweet, it'd definitely satisfy those with a sweet tooth!The coffee was particularly disappointing. With beans from sarnies, it failed to provide the kick the usual Joe from sarnies does and lacked depth. It was also rather acidic with a distinct difference between the milk and espresso, failing to come together as a whole.Overall, a nice place to try if you're in the area, but personally not worth the wait given it's higher price tag and the availability of better options in the vicinity."

Though the entrance was huge, somehow we couldn't see it. The three of us stood outside Gothe Institut scratching our heads, where's The Lokal?A quick phone call and one of the service staff came out to ""pick us"". Somehow the diagonal entrance escaped our eyes. Walking into the cafe, it was fairly empty. At around 7pm, there were only 2 tables filled. The full fledged bar welcomes us as we entered then the open kitchen at the back. As we had made reservations, we were seated where the nice cushion seats were. Tucked in a cosy corner, it was the perfect place for 3 girls to hangout and share our hearts out.The menu came and we were told that the mains & appetizers are changed regularly. Since we decided on a side of truffle chips, we gave the appetizers a miss and ordered our mains. Recommendations from the service staff were the pork belly with Apple sauce and lamb shank in crispy wrap with cous cous. We ordered 2 pork belly and a lamb. To conclude our meal, we had the Sticky date pudding.The Truffle chips were served first, pipping hot with a huge serving of shredded cheese on top. The fragrance of the truffle oil was immense, totally tickled our nostrils.The pork belly was tender and literally melts in your mouth. The sweetness of the apple sauce nicely complemented the pork belly, lifting the palette from pleasure to joy. The portion was a little too much for me but a regular dude would have consumed it completely in glee. I didn't get to taste the lamb but I to say that it's not for the faint-hearted. The lamb is pungent (not in a bad way) so non-lamb lovers, beware. Now comes the sticky date pudding, the divine one that we all three swore we will be back when we need a pick-me-up. Rich and thick dark caramel sauce, coupled with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a really warm pudding, our tongue was dancing between the sensation of hot and cold and the sweetness from the sauce was balanced nicely with the ice cream. The pudding was moist and lovely.Dinner ended on a high note as we leave and were sent off with ""thank you""s from the staff. So coming back for the sticky date pudding!"

Caught a little break at work and checked out the new kid on the block, The Lokal in the Duxton area. This new cafe on Neil Road is the offspring of Sarnies, another crazy packed cafe that I've yet to try (ZOMG call myself a food blogger).Well The Lokal checked off all the boxes on the hipster cafe checklist and they even went as far as to throw in a $40k Slayer machine. Oh that sexy beast took me on an intense ride with his latte ($5.50) and I must say it was all very smooth. And a little nutty too. The beans are from Sarnies and they have their barista consultant, affectionately known as the K Man, who is overseeing the coffee making for now. Many would go for the signature Veal Schnitzel Burger ($28) served with a tangy grilled pineapple and red slaw but we skipped that because chunky chips weren't available that day! Instead, i opted for the Roast Beef on Rye ($17). The sandwich was a combination of perfectly caramelized onion and thinly sliced sautéed beef. The flavors were a little sweet and could be sharpened with a stronger mustard than the current grain mustard crème fraiche. It was a good roast beef sandwich nonetheless.The Roast Chicken Panini ($15) was good too. The filling included huge juicy slices of fresh tomato (not the cheapo Malaysian sort), copious amount of avocado mash, crispy pancetta and salty roast chicken meat. The bread was our favorite among the lot of sandwiches we had, partly because it's a little more pillowy and chewy. A healthier option is the Smashed Avocado with Ricotta Sourdough ($18). The ricotta is made in house, along with their yogurt as well. It was simply topped with some pomelo and almonds, drizzled with olive oil. I liked the separate components of the dish but it came together rather plainly. A touch of honey could make this a better dish in my opinion but that's just my preference. I was looking forward to the Banana bread with Hokey Pokey ice cream ($12) but was sorely disappointed when I bit into the soggy bread cloyingly soaked by the citrusy syrup. We wondered where the ice cream went to as well (i swear i didn't take forever to grab a shot). Instead we had a sour cream sorta mixture on our dish. I couldn't bear more than a full bite of this one but K had no issue finishing it for us.Overall, The Lokal is a decent place for a hearty sandwich and it's probably going to be really packed on the weekends. A little bird told me that the Sarnies people are gonna be opening another cafe soon so do watch out for them!"

Overall it's too big and there's too little slipper lobster. It's about 80% purple slaw and 20% slipper lobster. Just imagine getting slipper lobster 1 in every 5 bites. The slipper lobster was kind of tasteless and the roll was too huge and just a glorified hotdog bun. The handcut fries were excellent, though one wouldn't come back just for the fries, would one."

Pardon me if I sound really jaded but... it's all starting to look the same? The slightly-deconstructed interiors, the limited brunch menu, the old-school plates and cups... same old, same old. With more than a hundred of such cafes dotting our little island (all springing like wildflowers in the past 3 years or so), it's starting to get a bit dated, and standing out is becoming somewhat challenging for all these cafes. Unfortunately, The Lokal fits into the typical mold of all the new wave of hipster cafes. I'd like to be more excited, but after visiting this place for today's Yelp brunch... I just didn't find anything that would make it stand out. Not to say that it's bad, it's OKAY, a DECENT but not fantastic place to have a meal.I ordered the roast chicken panini with a smoked salmon side. The smoked salmon was alright, though a bit cold (one of my dining companions thought that it was okay though). The sandwich came stuffed with the chicken, strips of crispy bacon, tomatoes and avocadoes. The vegetables tasted alright (tomatoes were better than other places... say, Subway), the chicken was sufficiently moist, the bacon was crispy but had no taste. We went in a group of 14 and sampled a good proportion of the (smallish) menu - the overall verdict was that it was ok, but nothing to shout about.I had a mocha. It was ok, not bad, but again- not amazing.The best part was probably the sticky date pudding, which was yummy and quickly gobbled up by one of the kids!Prices are reasonable and portions are decently-sized. My meal came up to slightly below $20 for a sandwich and a coffee, and I felt satiated at the end (although I wasn't satisfied). Verdict? It's alright if you happen to be in the area, but not worth traveling for."

All of the Greek places I tried before this place seemed to me that they were serving middle eastern food poorly prepared. This place is different!We went with the mixed meat platter for two and everything they had was good. I specially enjoyed the spiciness of the beef sausage and also enjoyed the lamb chop the most. The meatball is really good as well. The chicken yorio and the kebab are ok but nothing special. The portion is good for two people and you should order one starter if you aren't planning to eat dessert. We opted to eat dessert and ordered baklava and they gave us Greek yogurt on the House. The baklava was just ok nothing special. I would skip dessert next time but the meat there was really good.Highly recommend you reserve a table given it was fully reserved when we arrived and sat on the bar side

After some quick research by the wife, we discovered that they've ventured out to open Bakalaki Greek Taverna at Seng Poh Road and we knew that we had to head down to give it a try. First impressions. It felt like being home again. The warm greeting from George and Christos is always something to look forward to and we loved how Bakalaki felt a lot like the original place at Upper Bukit Timah (with a lot more space). Saganaki Kefalotyri ($16.90)This simple looking dish has always been one of my favourite. This beautifully pan fried Kefalotyri is not overly salty and melting with goodness. Topped with a squeeze of lemon and it brings out the richness and flavours of the cheese wonderfully. Perffffferrcccctttttt! Best eaten hot! Horiatiki ($20.90)Definitely one of the best Traditional Greek salad around. The wife who doesn't normally enjoy raw salads really love the Greek salad here. The Cherry tomatoes used are amazingly sweet, mixed with the freshness of the cucumber, pungent-ness of the onions, the saltiness of the olives, creaminess of the feta and the brightness of lemon juice made this salad an absolute delight to have! Pita Bread ($2.90)The pitas here don't look like much but they are so so good. Light, almost fluffy, they go absolutely perfect with the dips (5 different dips) that are available. That hint of salt added a nice dimension to the pita while the oregano gave it a nice, earthiness to the pita.Dips ($14.90 - $15.90 for single portions or $16.90 for 2 half portions)We went with the 2 half portions for the variety and tried their Taramosalata (Cod roe dip) and the classic Tzatziki (cucumber and Greek yogurt). A little strange not seeing Hummus on the menu but at least it got us trying something different. The tzatziki was fantastic. Light, refreshing and a real palette cleanser as we moved from dish to dish. The Taranosalata on the other hand really packed it punch! It was wonderfully rich, salty yet had this brightness to it because of the lemon juice. And I might get murdered for this but it went perfectly well with not only the pita but with the potato and grilled octopus tentacles. Paidakia ($32.90 for 3 pieces) The lamp chops here are a must have and a favourite here. The lamp is wonderfully marinated, ensuring that, for the lesser fans of lamb, there isn't that overpowering smell of lamb. It's perfectly seasoned and the knife cuts through the meat like butter. It had the perfect amount of meat to fat ratio, ensuring the lamb chops remain juicy and succulent. For those who used to frequent the old place and know how good the lamb is, the ones here are as fantastic!Htapodi ($32.90)Another favourite and must have is the grilled octopus tentacles. A lot of love and care goes into cooking octopus tentacles (legs), ensuring that they come on tender and succulent. Grilling them alone isn't enough and it often takes and hour or so of braising. The octopus here doesn't get any more perfect. Juicy, succulent, tender, it is absolute bursting with the flavours of the mediterranean.  A must have, whether you're a regular or visiting for the first time. Thanks to Christos, we managed to try 2 new desserts on their menu.Rizogalo ($11.90)This creamy rice pudding was really quite a surprise. It looked really heavy but was actually very light, not overly sweet and perfect after a flavourful meal. Loukoumades ($14.90)Little puffs of sunshine. These little traditional Greek doughnuts and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Drizzled with honey and dipped in the chocolate at the side, it brought a little burst of happiness with every bite. Overall, I loved the hospitality of Bakalaki. It feels like you're being welcomed to a great big Greek family dinner every time you're there. The ambience is very nice and open and with a fairly open concept, it doesn't feel stuffy or stifling and makes for a very comfortable dining experience."

The food and service were both impeccable and left me in high spirits the rest of the day. I especially enjoyed the grilled octopus, which was juicy, soft and flavourful! The dips were also nicely paired with the warm toasted pita bread that was peppered with some herbs and coarse salt. The house wines added a nice touch to the meal as well."

Signature Greek items were very well executed - the taramosalata was rich and creamy without being overpowering. Of the items we ordered, we thought that Bakalaki did a better job on some while Blu Kouzina (the other Greek restaurant) did a better job on others. Overall, high-quality food.The service, however, was abysmal. I would have written it off if the poor service occurred once, but it happened four times - it was difficult to get anyone's attention to (a) get water refilled, (b) order additional items, (c) ask for the dessert menu, (d) pay.In fact, there were a few occasions where some staff walked by us to the shelves near to where we were sitting to do their thing, and they seemed to take extra care to avoid eye contact with me. The unnecessary delays added up and by the time we received the dessert menu, we decided to skip dessert.One possibility is that we were seated near a large group and the waiters were busy with that group. However, the maitre d should have assigned waiters accordingly. At Bakalaki's price point, this level of service was not acceptable."

We made reservations more than 2 weeks in advance for a special occasion for 10 people. Yet, when our party arrived (10 minutes earlier than reservation time), our table had been given away. We knew this because we were told that our table was prepared but they were accidentally given away to a group of tourists. We had to wait for tables to be vacated, cleaned, set. We were initially squeezed into 2 tables, that was then extended to 3 when some other diners left. The service recovery was poor.

The skin to wrap the ingredients was light yet not too delicate and the taste reminded me of the wrapping of an old school Hong Kong sweet snack. You are presented with a range of condiments to go inside the wrap ... and the whole experience is exemplified with a step by step instruction card that is a cute and nice touch. We also had their bak kut teh. It was slightly different to the usual style, the soup was tasty but heavier than usual, but the rib was soft and succulent and just fell off the bone!Another dish worth mentioning is the chicken. It was succulent and juicy, and was stuffed with rice in a dark marinate with bits of veggies and Chinese mushroom. Super tasty!A Kailan with Kale side was interesting ... the two types of kales coming together, served cold in a delicious sauce. The cocktails were good - my Lady Luck came in a fancy cup of a lady's head. My friend had a Kopi Cat - it was delicious, basically a kopi with vodka. Yum. Highly recommend - I don't give 5s often!"

The food fell in two buckets, very good and very meh, which put me on the fence given that this is a fine dining restaurant AND I have enjoyed Willin's food at Wild Rocket back in the day.Our meal started of course with the signature dish, Popiah. The skin was really, really soft and just flexible enough that a clumsy person like me could roll my own popiah and not tear it. Ok I lied. I ripped my popiah right down the center, but i ate it anyway because I don't know, it cost $58?! The chilli and stewed pork filling, which I would argue make or break the dish, did the job but lacked any kick. I mean this could have been a knock your socks off starter, but it tasted more like a dish I'd use to introduce Western friend's to local cuisine.What should've been our knock-your-socks-off starter was the charcoal grilled Iberico satay. Oh em gee. Now THIS, this giant succulent skewer chock full of slightly fatty pork, marinated in spices and then grilled, was just perfect. One of the best satays I've eaten and here's looking at you, Violet Oon at National Gallery. Next we had the barramundi salad, which was basically a yusheng plated to look like a garden with flowers. Very fresh fish, good dash of citrus and oils and aromatic flowers. Light and refreshing on the palate before the next porky dish, which was Kurubota char siew. Oh this had so much promise as it looked like the strips at Char and mm that Cantonese restauarant near Keong Siak. Alas this plate had some of the natural juiciness one would expect from Kurubota,  but it didn't have enough fat to take things to the next level. I really was disappointed since the plate was set right in front of me. Fight over the satays we did, but not the char siew.For mains, the standout by a mile was the prawn mee. It had these large chargrilled prawns sitting on pork laced, Hokkien mee style noodles that were just wet enough to slop on your plate and gobble down. Really really really really good. I was also looking forward to the paper spring chicken since it had glutinous rice stuffed in it, but it turned out very dry - makes sense because turkeys cooked with stuffing also get dried out and I imagine a smaller bird would have had a better chance with wet aromatics in the cavity and the rice steamed separately. Veal cheek rendang was also another meh dish - not exactly flavorful or falling apart at the touch of a fork. Why liddat?! Lastly the sambal forrest mushrooms were...fried mushrooms with sambal. Interesting combo, liked the sambal (so why couldn't the popiah chilli have more kick?). After eating pretty much the whole menu, we got what was incorrectly described as ""Goreng pisang with gula melaka gelato"". Gula melaka gelato....step right up! I actually tahaned a whole 20 mins more of conversation just for the dessert, only the realize what the menu meant was ""Goreng pisang, drizzled with gula melaka sauce AND gelato"". Haiyaaaaa. Anyway it was still a cool dessert - the goreng pisang was covered in those Chinese rice krispie thingies and fried, drizzled lightly with gula melaka  and then plopped on ice cream. It was delicious, lots of different textures and looked unusual.So there you have it. If I were to eat at Po again I would go straight for the satay, prawn mee and barramundi yu sheng. Drink wise I only got to try the whiskey based cocktail that comes in a bottle - it was quite well mixed though there was an overwhelming taste of caramel instead of banana and bitters. Stronger than it tasted so I enjoyed the kick. All in all, the restaurant was buzzing, some of the dishes were great but you're definitely paying up for it."

Nevertheless, still a great staple in most brewhouses!2. Roasted Duck with Cabbage and Potato Dumpling $18++ *Highly Recommended*This was my favourite dish as the duck was so tender! A signature Czech dish with traditional ingredients, the cabbage was also mildly sour with a good mix of juiciness.3. Chicken Paprikash $16++At first, I had mistakened this for a curry chicken with rice! The chicken itself was a bit bland but together with the delicious creamy sous, it was rather delightful.4. Beef Goulash $16++This is a traditional Czech pub food. The beef chunks are slow-cooked for hours with Czech spices till the stew becomes aromatic. The beef here were sizable chunks but didn't have the melt in your mouth texture I had expected. The stew was very flavourful though!Overall : Prague Microbrewery and Restaurant is the first of it's kind in Singapore that is very authentic and sincere in both their drinks and food.

For dessert we had the basque burnt cheesecake, the only item which I felt was a bit of a let down, didn't find it that different from a normal cheesecake (although it was still tasty). Had hoped for a flavor of more Spanish cheese in it. Even though, its a superb place to try out Spanish cuisine in Singapore!"

Prefer the bar over their restaurant. Looks like you need a reservation for the bar also now. Before it was just first come first served.Surprised I haven't written a review about Binomio yet. I could have sworn I did.Sounds like praises have been sung by the other reviews already. Just co-signing here.Really like the Larios 12 gin & tonic they make with juniper berries. It's a steal at $14 per drink.Their 6 for $69 tapas tasting menu (or 9 for $99) is quite a great deal for the quality and amount of food you get. It also lets you explore their tapas menu. There's a surcharge for starred menu items but still worth it!Awesome place to relax over a couple of good drinks and nosh. Check it out.

Good ambience and service was good, food was tasty without being spectacular. For tapas we had crab empanadas, pulpo (my favourite), scallops, and finished with a squid ink paella for main. Empanada pastry was a bit too thick and doughy for my liking but crab filling was certainly tasty. A bit disappointed when the head waiter said they looked like ""curry puffs"" when describing the specials, and didn't seem to know what I was referring to when I asked if they were empanadas. Pulpo was delicious. Squid was beautifully tender. Scallops were really disappointing. For such a pricy dish I couldn't believe they sliced the scallops in half meaning we effectively only got 2 scallops. Give us 4 whole ones for $25!Paella was tasty enough though again incredibly stingy with the proteins (seafood). Overall a nice place in a nice area, but couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed when leaving."

Bunuelos de chocolate Chocolate fritters with sorbet. Pretty standard. Think fried doughnut balls dipped in chocolate. The service- Overall was good. Chef Alonso personally serves the Paella and spends time chatting with the guests.

We chose the 6 tapas tasting menu (such a steal at a mere S$69, compared to all the other swanky tapas bars in Singapore), and went with all of the waiter's recommendations. Every dish was presented so beautifully and they were delicious. My favourites - Croquetas de Champinones, Pulpo a la gallega and Huevos Binomio. We were so happy with the selection, and everything was perfect until our paella arrived. Thinking tapas wouldn't be filling enough (they were), we had ordered their Arroz Negro (squid ink paella). Not only was it too salty and unappetizing, especially compared with the tapas we just had, it cost us more than the 6 tapas tasting menu! We were all bewildered. We'll definitely be back at the tapas bar! The 6 tapas ordered was sufficient for the 3 of us, but I think I'll be greedy next time and go with the 8 tapas tasting menu. Or more.. They were just so yummy! Perhaps we'll try something else from their dining menu too! Just not the squid ink paella. Snuck in a corner of Craig Road without too much traffic, noise or people, the place was just what we needed for a chillaxing Friday night."

The restaurant dishes were, in my opinion, a tad tastier and fancier than the bar offerings, but does not warrant the difference in price tag. A typical bar tapas is about 6-10 bucks whereas for the restaurant, it's about 15-40, albeit the portions being slightly bigger. I like the bar because you can get many tapas without hurting your wallet. The tapas are generally tasty, made with good ingredients. The entrocote was really good, as well as the pan con tomate, the shrimps and the bone marrow. Will be back. P.S: Wine by the glass is a meagre pour, so get a bottle."

Ill or not, the show must go on.Binomio is designed with a tapas bar in front and an elegant dining room at the back. We made reservations and some requests earlier on and the service manager was obliging. We had the mushroom croquettes, grilled squid, crayfish and pork belly as tapas starters. We crayfish and croquettes were excellent, but the squid and pork belly  weren't particularly interesting. We then had a giant pan of squid ink paella to share and it was very well done. We would have liked to have more charred rice bits but that's just me being picky. For mains, we had a suckling pig, the fish and I had the lamb chops. The suckling pig wasn't quite as mind blowing as the ones we've had in Barcelona or Segovia, but it was still good. I also thought my lamb chops were executed well as they were juicy and charred at the bone.

We had the regular kaya combo with kopi, and one French toast variation with tea.The toast was nice with the right amount of butter and kaya, and the french toast was delicious (some argued that it is too dry which I cannot confirm). The eggs were quite runny, thus my husband did not touch them and I guess this might be a no-go to a lot of (European) people.What I like about this place? The traditional feel, the many locals, the good food (apart maybe from the egg-situation) low cost (we paid 11 S$), and the option to sit outside under the fans (tables there might be quite dirty when it is busy). What I don't like? The ignorant attitude by some of the girls working there. Yes, we do not speak Chinese, but ignoring requests and stomping off does not help. We are nice people, and my husband is the most polite and friendliest person I know, however when he asked for more toast, twice, he got blank stares or was plainly ignored by the female staff, just left standing.Thus, although I liked the place initially, I might not visit again."

To be honest, while it was good, it didn't blow me away. I felt like the toast came out cold, like it had been sitting waiting for me. The butter was cold (as is the style, I think) and a kind of thin application of kaya. I skipped the eggs, not being an egg guy, which confused the staff, apparently not ordering a ""set"" of kaya toast, soft boiled eggs, and kopi is unusual. That said, the kopi-C was probably the best I had while I was in Singapore. Very rich, not overly sweet...I came here on my first morning for my first meal, and it started a love affair, that's for sure. And as with most other small places I ate in Singapore, it's amazingly cheap, just a few dollars."

The crunch is good on this though. 2) chicken clay pot: another famous dish of theirs, I enjoyed it. 3) tofu with minced meat: loved this dish!!

You occupy one location as a kopi tiam for 75 years, hand down recipes, grill grease and oven char generation after generation, basically watch Keong Saik go from a dirty road of prostitution to Singapore's new ""it"" street while still continuing to pump out fast, cheap and flavorful dishes and some of the best kopi and kaya I've ever had, and then you get forced to up and move to a new spot and are expected to pick up right where you left off?

To be honest, I wasn't that hungry but I didn't want to let a minute go to waste since I don't make it to SG that often. I was staying in Chinatown and had arrived earlier that day, so I figured I would eat close to my hotel in case the sun became too much.Chinatown is full of shops and dumplings. Unfortunately, it is also full of tourists.I did my best to avoid tourists and found a small dumpling shop hidden behind a construction zone. I figure the construction zone is not usual because the the shop, Jing Hua Xiao Chi, had been featured multiple times on various ""Best Dumplings"" lists. Okay, so it wasn't the hidden gem I was hoping for but it was definitely not riddled with tourists and that was good enough for me!The walls were red and tastefully (pun intended) decorated with photos of dumplings. Overall the shop was small and fairly empty. I didn't spot a single tourist out of the three groups that were in the restaurant. The staff was nice and sat me quickly and a menu and ordering pad were waiting for me at the table.I was running short on cash and Jing Hua didn't take cards (for the amount I spent.) Fortunately, the dumplings weren't too expensive. After entering the shop, I immediately looked at the menu to see what drinks they had. I needed something refreshing after a short walk that seemed to take an eternity. I noticed they had a Mango Juice on the menu for $3 ($2.20 USD) and I went for it. It was more than I would prefer to spend on a drink but this kind of stuff goes for $10 in California, plus I was desperate.I wanted to check every box on the menu but remembered the minimal cash I had in my wallet and decided to go with the classic Xiao Long Bao for $8 ($5.88 USD) an honest steal compared to SF prices. I've had many a Xiao Long Bao and part of me wanted to try one of the pan fried dumplings, but alas, I decided to play it safe and go with a fan favorite.The Mango Juice was just what I needed. It was refreshing and slightly thick. If it wasn't made of real mango it certainly had me fooled. There was an odd touch of rose water but it grew on me and I downed the whole thing pretty much before the dumplings came. I don't even like mango, but I liked this.Not long after the Mango Juice arrived, a plate of steaming-hot dumplings was placed right in front of me. I was so excited but slightly nervous because I didn't want to be disappointed by this apparently-famous dumpling house. The classic soy/vinegar dumpling sauce was already on the table so I poured myself a saucer-full and placed a single dumpling into the saucer to soak and cool a bit.What happened next was incredible. The dumpling was still hot but I couldn't wait any longer. I put it in my mouth and felt the soup flow in my mouth as I chewed. It was a mix of soy, vinegar, pork juices and sesame. I think the sesame part was pretty unique but maybe that's just how they do it in Singapore. Whatever the reason, I am happy they discovered this combination of flavors because it was a true delight and I would definitely go back.I wolfed down the seven dumplings, walked up to the front of the shop and paid. In case it wasn't clear, I was one happy customer.If you spend enough money, they take Visa. Pay at the front.Total Cost: $13.30 ($9.77 USD)21 Neil RdSingaporeThis post is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews"

I never walk along this side of Neil Road but one Sunday in search of food or anything even open worth trying around this area, I stumbled upon Jing Hua. It was open, air conditioned, and there wasn't a crowd so I thought I'd give it a try.I was surprised at the number of Yelp reviews mostly raving about Jing Hua. I cracked up as I read through a number of the reviews while ordering and eating my meal. I especially cracked up at Ida's review as there was a twist to the ending where she ordered all that food for herself! I did the same and didn't feel bad about it after seeing her review, haha.The xiao long bao are very good. On par with DTF I'd say. I really enjoyed my hot and sour noodle soup. It's just like regular hot and sour soup but with a nice thick udon-y noodle to help balance out soup with some carbs.The lotus pancake was awesome also. Not the healthiest as it's deep fried but the skin was crispy to perfection and the lotus inside was subtly sweet and added a good gooey texture to go with the crispy skin. I took half home for breakfast the next morning and although not as good fresh, it was still semi-crispy and enjoyable.I'll be back Jing Hua!"

The veggies are also very simple: stir-fried in garlic but $8 for a small portion. Come here if you're really, REALLY craving old-style, mama homemade kind of dumplings.

This is both a good and bad sign; the good thing is that the skin is delicate and the bad sign is that I am too rowdy with this plump meaty babies.These  Xiao Long Baos ($7++ for 7pcs) are near perfect--the ball of minced pork at the center, loose and yielding, as if itself in midmelt. My 2nd XLB landed in my spoon intact and buoyant, and I popped the entire thing comfortably in my mouth. There could be a little more of that liquefied pork gelatin but I'm just being greedy. Other dumplings variations include the steamed vegetarian dumplings stuffed with taupok bits and crunchy turnips which even non-vegetarians will delight. The Seafood and Pork Dumplings had a slightly chewy feel but the ingredients tasted fresh and not too greasy. I prefer the pan-fried version ($8++ for 10 pieces) which transformed the original chewy skin into delicate crunchy bites with tantalizing burnt aroma. This gives the pan-fried dumpling more character, as if it was a  golden pillow case Perfect if there were more chives. The mastery achievement goes beyond the dumplings to the noodles and the desserts. The Noodle with Minced Pork & Soya Bean Sauce 炸酱面 ($5++), is wonderfully alchemized by the minced pork and age-old calculus soya bean paste that Iess salty than other specimens. The Osmanthus soup with glutinous rice ball soup ($3++) arrived hot and fragrant with warm floral inhalations. Hand-made with a spot-on dough-to-filling ratio, each tiny pop is rolled with a different flavour; lotus and walnut, black sesame, red bean and peanuts.  Another must-try is the Crispy Red Bean Pancake ($10++) that is prepared freshly upon order. Expertly deep-fried till they are like crunchy fritters, the dark brown parcels oozes dense, sweet red bean paste with charred sesame aroma. After such a satisfying meal, I am convinced that the Han's decision to leave the menu unchanged for 25 years was a right one. Consistent quality food that can stand the test of time.

However, by focusing on just a few, they've really boiled it down to the dishes they've best at and famous for, and everything is absolutely delicious, although I am not a fan of the Chinese pizza. The xiao long bao are not as dainty and refined as the ones you would find elsewhere, but they are hearty and pack great flavour. My personal favourite dish, however, is their pan-fried dumpling.

I had been told there would be a wait at all hours, bad service but the most ridiculously delicious dumplings in Singapore. Well, the service was actually decent and attentive by both Singapore and authentic Chinese restaurant standards (I can't say which is supposed to be worse). I didn't encounter the grumpy boss and we were seated immediately.We ordered the xiao long bao, guo tie, spinach with oyster sauce, zha jiang mian and red bean pancake. The xiao long bao was as it should be, meaning perfectly hot with lots of soup inside and a good amount of pork and seafood. Divine. The guo tie was similarly awesome - fried to crisp but served on a dry plate with none of that leaky oil puddle crap you get at alot of la mian hawker stalls. The spinach dish was generous and not salty at all and the zha jiang mian, oh what mian. Soft noodles, bowl-lickin' sauce and a good dash of crisp cucumber shreds and spinach.There was nothing bad to say about our experience (well maybe the $0.60 I had to pay for unused wet towels that couldn't be returned) and I intend to return many more times.

Finally got a Tiger Beer ($9.60/ lg bottle) which was unusually frosty.It is a pity the Chinese Pizza was not available, worth trying next time. If they can also add-in the GST to the prices, it would make it a bit more honest."

Their steamed xiao long baos, and pretty much all kinds of dumplings have the same shrimp pork filling, which has a delicate seafood sweetness to it, especially in the xiao long baos. This taste is distinctly lighter than the taste offered in places such as din tai fung or paradise dynasty, so you don't get the ""urgh too much pork oil"" kinda fullness at the end of the meal. Noteworthy is their minced meat noodles. Very starchy, very flavorful, and I love the chinese spinach that comes with it. Also, their ginger is sweet and tasty, and the vinegar has a hint of sweetness that I like. Last, but definitely not least, the red bean pancake was delicious. The crust is slightly crispy and sticky (think fried nian gao), and the red bean is not overly sweet. Just nice. Yum!"

The other couple sitting at our table recommended the pan fried guo tie over the xiao long bao (!!)Anyway, thankfully we got here somewhat early and didn't have to wait. We did have to share a table though, but that turned out for the better! More on that later.Ordered:1. Xiao long bao ($7.50) - had heard so much about these famed dumplings and so had to try them! What was amazing was that the skin was really springy/chewy and did NOT break, nor was there much fear that it would! This is very very rare. Quite a bit of soup inside, bf remarked that it is a lighter taste than one would find maybe at Din Tai Fung or something. Later he expounded upon this saying that if you eat it at one gulp, there's more flavour. 2. Zha Jiang Mian - pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing. Quite addictive though!3. Red bean pancake aka guo bing ($9) - here is where our lovely table companion couple came in. They had ordered one (whereas we'd waited to place the dessert order, just in case) and it looked pretty big, with 14 pieces I believe. I very much doubted that the bf and I would be able to finish one on our own (nor would it be a very good idea), and these deep fried things are just never as good reheated. Especially without the aid of a toaster oven! So, I nudged the bf to ask if they'd consider sharing it (since I also doubted they would be finishing it on their own). He did ask, and they said okay! Yay :) I didn't like it so much, it was really crispy on the outside but rather chewy on the inside (this, the bf liked - he likes chewy stuff). I would've just preferred more crisp. Anyway, it just led me to realize that their specialty seems to be making things chewy (read: the dumpling skin, the pancake skin). Back to the pancake - it had substantial red bean filling which wasn't too sweet, that's a plus!As another Yelper mentioned, compulsory $1.60 tagged on for the wet towels and peanuts (non-returnable because they don't charge service charge)."

The Peranakan 'sauce' was sour, spicy, and sweet, and complimented the squares of cod (juicy, fresh, meaty) perfectly, and the Duck was fragrant, well-roasted and I was so, so tempted to swallow the fat as well (thankfully, I resisted).

The pork rib has been de-boned and cooked in a tangy-sweet sauce. We all loved it especially eating it with the crispy yam strip. We then had the Deep fried prawns with Orange sauce.The sweet and sour taste brought out the freshness of the prawns. Our last dish was the Broccoli fried with Deer meat in Honey sauce.

Not sure how that marriage is working out for them but the Italian-Japanese fusion thing Chef Seita Nakahara has going on at Terra is quite extraordinary. We showed up at 7:30 sharp and was greeted with a ""hello, what is the reservation name under?"". The hostess guided us to the table and asked all the appropriate questions to ensure a pleasant dining experience. The hostess returned to the table with a tray full of lobsters, crabs, oysters, giant prawns, tomatoes, etc. highlighting all things Japanese with the only exception being the Australian truffles. Appreciated seeing the freshness in the raw ingredients and made the anticipation all the more fun. The dining room was cozy and tastefully decorated. We were indecisive with the menu and settled for the omakase, but sneaked in our general preferences to the chef. I'm happy to say that the kitchen was more than accommodating. All the dishes were delightful but the highlights were definitely the grilled Saga beef with it's beautiful glossy marbling, and the baked scallop from Salfutu with Japanese mushroom in tomato based sauce. The dishes are clearly Italian but Japanese ingredients are utilized creating a unique and creative cuisine experience. The restaurant's pasta is pretty special too. They are made daily based on techniques learned from chefs in Italy. The pastas are made with the old, wooden pasta machine you will find displayed in the dining room.Chef Seita brings the best ingredients to the dining table every night. The menu is created with products that are from the farmers and fishermen he connected with during his one-year sabbatical travel to Japan. After we polished off our dessert dish, he came out from the kitchen to check in on us and the first thing I noticed was how young he looked. He looked like he should be on a stage belching out some rock song instead of working in a kitchen. He shared about his restaurant concept and said that he was born in Tokyo, worked as a chef all over Italy, but he returned to Singapore because he considers it his home where he was raised. Pretty cool chatting with him and appreciated the time since the restaurant was bustling but that just means he fully trust his crew. The evening service was very cordial and attentive. Water glasses were always filled, napkins always refolded when walked away, new silverware with each dish presented, overall - excellent, non-overbearing attention to service.Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a unique Tokyo-Italian menu to tantalise your tastebuds."

For the uninitiated, Impossible Foods is a US based company that makes plant-based replacement foods for meat and dairy.  Impossible Foods goal is to make delicious foods that have the benefit of meat, but not the negative health benefits on humans and negative environmental associated with livestock products. In short, it is the chance for people like me that do not eat red meat, to enjoy what is supposed to be the most closest thing to meat I can get.  So I was intrigued about the idea of enjoying a big juicy hamburger...albeit all made of plants.  And not a disappointment.  Three Buns is a cool place.  It has super cool music playing like People Under the Stairs & Souls of Mischief.  Seating both inside and out, one space spills into the other, tables are wooden or table top at a bar, the place feels super local and has a play area for kids right out front.  We saw girls here for brunch, we say families with little kids and we saw couples like us.  The vibe is minimal, friendly, environmentally friendly. This was my first Impossible Foods experience, for it is new to Singapore, although sprinkled around a few restaurants on the island.  My plant based burger came at a price...a whopping $27 price tag for the burger alone.  Worth every penny!  This plant based burger looks like a hamburger...juicy drippings, soft meaty texture, delicious!  A meat eater might not know the difference.  The burger itself is not giant, but it was absolutely tasty...from the bun, to the sauce, to the Impossible plant-based burger itself!  I would pay $27 to consume it again.  Now a meat eater would most likely not agree because the price might be intimidating, but for we pescatarians or anyone seeking a healthier option...this burger rocks!Coupled with some truffle cheese fries, a milkshake and a tentative friendly staff, I think Three Buns is the bomb!  Simple, easy, plant-based, local, cool."

With many old folks hanging around drinking beer along with their food, Tian Jin really is not one most young adults will head to. In fact, Chinatown isn't one most people to go to in the first place. But Raffles was on to something good when he decided to put so many Chinese together in a spot because it led to some really good culinary effervescence we get to enjoy today!My brother ordered a bowl of Zha Jiang Mian ($3.80) to fill his hungry stomach after our Saturday French classes. This dish hails from Northern China and is a humble offering of thick wheat noodles topped with ground pork sauteed with Zha Jiang (salty fermented soybean paste) and sliced cucumbers for a good measure.For gyoza lovers, do not look down on the boiled counterpart to your favourite water-grilled bites. Here at Tian Jin Fong Kee, the dumplings ($6 for 10 pieces) have a rich stock which bursts into your mouth with the first bite. With dumplings, the meat to skin proportion is a fine balance but Tian Jin does well by having a good amount of well marinated meat along with the suitably thin skin to match. Move over Din Tai Fung, Tian Jin's pseudo xiaolongbaos are bigger in taste, better in texture and, the best part, cheaper.There's also no missing the gyoza ($6 for 10 pieces) which is my personal favourite. For the uninformed, gyozas are not fried in oil as they may appear to be but rather ""dry-fried"" in water. Hence, they are commonly called potstickers too because of their tendencies to stick to the non-stickiest of non-stick pans due to the cooking method. Because of this cooking method, the gyoza's also retain the juices of their meat while maintaining the chewy bite of the skin."

Think 2 pieces of braised pork belly with some Vege garnish held together by soft taco. Nice but again, small. Chicken Quesadilla - tasty, just wish there's more of it.

In fact, our server asked us about how the food was, and what we thought about the taco (quality, price, etc). We agreed that it was somewhat expensive, but was pretty good nonetheless!My fish taco ($11) was pretty yummy, somewhat charred (and hence salty), but good fish, and nice topping of chipotle mayo (slightly spicy!) and cucumbers (i think?) etc. Got a little messy with fish juices flowing, but not too disastrous :p My friend got the beef taco ($10) and found it somewhat spicy still (low spice tolerance, oops!)We filled up on corn chips + guacamole/roasted tomato salsa ($12). Yum, since I think it's hard to find guacamole in Singapore. I found the taste of the salsa somewhat curious.. couldn't identify what was in it that gave a certain taste. Anyhow, slightly spicy too, not bad!Would like to be back to try the stuffed pepper sometime.. The place definitely started filling up around 7:30pm! Thankfully we got there around 6:30pm so it wasn't too crowded yet.On a side note, luckily our server told us to check the bill - because we got the wrong bill and it was TWICE the amount we spent.. I'm like, we did NOT order any of these things! Even though another server tried to foist two corn orders and a pork taco on me. I'm like.. we're done eating (and have been, for a while), why are you giving me more food.. O.o Thankfully they got us the right bill in the end."

Each taco was awfully tiny and the tortilla was rather dry. The batter on the fish wasn't crunchy, and they skimped on the cabbage. There was an interesting-tasting mango topping on the fish, but it definitely wasn't authentic. I've visited countless taquerias in the state of California and I know what I'm talking about. People, a taco is cheap street food. It's normally US$1.99 per fish taco, and at S$11 + tax + tip per taco, I expected killer taste for that killer price.The ceviche was decent, not overly sour and the seafood was fresh. However they also skimped on the tortilla chips. The Costillas (ribs) were generally forgettable, although tender, the sauce was rather odd, tomatoish and tasted like it came out of a can. The only redeeming thing was the Pastel de Elote Azul, a blue corn cake with agave nectar & mezcal cream. The corn cake was warm and crumbly with the contrasting smooth texture of the cream beside it. However, I wasn't sure if this was something authentic. I also saw a huitlacoche (corn fungus) quesadilla in one of the pictures here on yelp, however I didn't see that on the menu. Don't get me wrong, the drinks are good, food ingredients are higher quality, and the atmosphere is hip (if you're into that kind of thing). For some reason, this place is the current ""in"" spot, filled with expats holding their margaritas. Lucha libre decor aside, the sky-high prices really turned me off. Food is okay if you haven't tried authentic mexican food, but not *that* mind-blowing to warrant this kind of pricing. My wallet felt gutted."

I can't believe I am saying this but thankfully the dishes weren't too tasty for me to break my resolve. I started with a humble fish taco. I've read other reviews that marked it as a ""yummy but overpriced"" item. Overall, it was ok. A bit too small for it to be considered a meal. Definitely an appetizer and a stingy one at that. If you enjoy fish tacos, I would recommend Tanuki raw's. They serve 2 tacos at $15 and they taste better than the ones here :) Lucha Loco's tacos were too wet. Too much hot sauce made the tortilla soggy :( and very messy to eat. The rest of the dishes I nibbled on a bit but nothing really impressed me very much. Yet this place was full house on a Wed night mind you! Amazing. I attribute its success to the beautiful ambiance and location. Duxton Hill is earning a reputation for drawing in the yuppie crowd. A place to be seen and to see. A feast for the eyes but sadly not the taste buds! haha... 1. Fish taco (fried) - Ok. I had better. 2. Pork ribs - Ok. A bit too saucy? Tasted like a ribs with too much BBQ sauce. 3. Truffle quesadilla - Ok4. Guacamole - I didn't mind it but my dinner companions said it didn't have much of a flavor which was true. It basically tasted like an avocado dip. Very little taste of lime, salt or anything else. That being said, I do like my avocados. The dip was moist and fresh. 5. Salsa - HORRIBLE!!! I can't really describe it. It tasted like cheap tomato ketchup. Everyone on the table barely touched it. 6. Blue Corn Cake with agave nectar and mescal cream - PASS! The cake was so dry even the mescal cream could not make it go down any easier. The mescal cream with berries however were a lovely combination. Then again, who doesn't love berries and cream???7. Sangria - Good. Very light and mild. Not much alcohol but I didn't mind it. I wished I tried their Elotes - Mexican street style grilled corn. It looks peppered with interesting seasonings. Maybe one day when I am around the neighborhood and craving corn I'll pop by for a taste. Otherwise, there isn't much else (food wise) that will compel me to go back."

Nonetheless, if I'm looking for tacos, this is definitely the place I'm going to be. Drinks were good, creative, and relatively cheap as well at $15-20.I came here with a group of girlfriends for dinner and some drinks. We all enjoyed our meal, but were surprised to see a $400+ bill. Damn, with only 5 people eating and 1 person ordering 1 drink, what the hell did we order??? With closer inspection, we realized that each time the waitress came and asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa there was an additional $5-7 charge. Thank you for NOT telling us. I'm sorry, if you're going to be asking, please do make sure we understand that there will be an additional charge. Most Italian places do not charge extra for their breads so we definitely didn't expect this to be the case at Lucha Loco. I personally paid over $60 for two tacos and two drinks.

They don't take reservations but the girl on the phone said at 1930 it shouldn't be too bad. Anyway, we got there at 1930 and for 4 of us, the wait was close to an hour. No matter though as there are many cool bars in the area (and we went to the Tippling club to wait which was awesome).When we were finally seated, it was right at the back of the restaurant. While part of the appeal of Lucha Loco is the uptempo vibe, the balance is off in the back corner in that it's almost uncomfortably dark and loud (so you have to strain to read the menus and shout to be heard). In the future I'd probably specify that I want to sit outdoors or near the front and just wait however long it takes.Food wise we got the beef tostadas, chicken quesadillas, pork belly tacos, chips and guac and something else. Yes the portions are somewhat small for the price but really it does feel comparable to other similar restaurants in Singapore. I somehow expected this place to be all show with no substance but was pleasantly surprised. All the food was actually fantastic and the pork belly taco in particular was the standout.Great margaritas and good food - it's definitely worth checking out.random comment - it was weirdly expat dominated to the point where I think we were the only table of locals. Not really a good or bad thing though."

No, I should correct myself and say that it was an extraordinary grilled corn smeared with chilli, mayonaise and cotija cheese that burst out sweet juices in each bite. I never knew a corn could have such a great allure.Since tacos are the first thing that comes to mind for Mexican cuisine, we instinctively picked the Tacos de pesdacos ($11), which is the fish version instead of pork belly, beef or shrimp. Ceviche (raw fish ""cooked"" in lime and lemon juice) was another popular item on many tables but we did not feel like having it that day. The tender chunks of grilled snapper dressed in chipotle mayo was smoky and slightly fiery. Admittedly, the tortilla skin was rather stretchy, but that extra red pepper salsa added a desirable crunch and zest to itI imagined the Crab Tostaditas with habanero, avocado and cucumber ($16) to be crunchy and creamy but somehow the dish did not deliver the taste. They were on the light, bland side.Our favourite was this vegan dish, Chiles Relanos($24), an ugly-looking roasted poblano pepper stuffed with rice, herbs and wild mushrooms. Every spoonful of filling with the heavenly pumpkin sauce simply lifts up your mood. So delicious that I did not mind skipping other meaty mains.As a dessert lover, I was sad to see only two items but ended up extremely pleased with the Pastel de Elote Azul ($14), a crumbly cake made with blue cornmeal topped with mezcal alcohol-spiked whipped cream. (Though it was served after 20min and not 5min as informed by the waiter) Moistened with agave nectar, the cake had a unique coarse texture and a subtle sweetness. Who says good cakes must be light and fluffy? This one is divine--a MUST TRY....To conclude, this is definitely the place to go for some authentic Mexican street food. If you are coming here for a full meal, I recommend that you order the main meal that are larger in portions as prices adds up when you order those small-sized appetizers. Plus, the cocktails here are not to be missed for those who loves drinking. Do go early before the crowd streams in as there is no reservations! Go late for their DJ music and u might meet the man in the mask."

Not to mention most ingredients are probably imported. So no it's not cheap, but its within the range of what I would expect to pay for for a restaurant in this area.Will definitely visit again.

The fish tacos were good, but extremely expensive at over S$10 per taco. Drinks ranged from $15-20+ per drink. Quality was so-so, not great but not terrible. What gives this place a low rating is the ""feeling you've been ripped off"", ie. the waitresses did not inform us that unless the majority of Mexican restaurants, guacamole and salsa are charged at approx $5-7 each time you ask for more guacamole and salsa. You will only get that nice surprise when the bill comes.I believe that if you are charging such premium prices for tacos and food, giving your customers some guac and salsa free of charge sounds normal, even expected.Speaking of guac and salsa, they were both very disappointing. If the owners claim that they are bringing ingredients in from Mexico directly (and hence the higher prices), I would wish that they emulated the more vibrant flavours of the guac and salsa that are served in authentic Mexican establishments.The service- not very attentive, sluggish.

Delicious food.  Fun ambiance tucked in Duxton Hill.  Drinks that warrant a visit on their own (Must try the Passion Fruit Caipiroska - you will not regret it).  Accommodating to large parties.  And perhaps most impressive, given that its in Singapore, outstanding service.Yeah, Yeah, sure I can understand other reviewers position that the prices were a bit high for the amount of food you get.  But, when you factor in the quality, location, and service, I think the prices are pretty on point.

You can tell a place is ""it"" if every other conference social is held there or for the casual observer, just look for the sign mid-week that says sorry this section is closed for a private event. So what does that mean per se?For one, the food is likely to be decent with a one or two stand out dishes that go well with drinks. I mean, that's the barometer for a lot of working folk right? You walk into a bar after work with this *gawsh I need a drink & some super unhealthy flash fried junk* look and proceed to order whatevers on tap and at happy hour prices (because you don't want to spend money on what is essentially becoming water after a hard day's work, literal and metaphorical pun intended) and then something to fill the stomach. I'd add that because I have had the chance to eat decent Mexican, I was also looking out for the One. That One Mexican restaurant that I could gamely say to out-of-towners sells decent Mexican food and hence upholds Singapore's culinary capital status. So what happened when I visited? Well for one I didn't pay for any of the food I ate so I've no idea how much it costs. Though I'll hazard it wasn't cheap given how enthusiastic the server was about putting food on my table so that she could bill my hosts (who were also covering just about half the bar). I really really liked the crab toastadas. Real crab meat, crunchy nacho used as the toastadas base. Excellent. I kind of liked the chorizo taco but that was it. The chicken taco wasn't great and the cheese in the mushroom quesadillas were more limp than crisp. In fact little secret guys, Bather's restaurant near my house does a really delicious simple cheese quesadilla and obviously beats this. I will say though that the nachos and salsa were pretty darn fine. As for the drinks, obviously I helped myself to the lime margarita and it was not bad. The corona was well, corona and since it was a Wednesday I decided not to venture into tequila territory. So is this It? Nope. Will this place last? I honestly can't say 100% yes. Portions weren't that generous and given that my work brethren like this place, I can imagine it isn't worth the price. But for what it's worth... if you're not picking up the tab, you'll have a pretty good time."

I still prefer the usual yellow noodles, but there are lots of orders for the noodles and bee-hoon mix.The amount of ""white"" cooked chicken is pricy for the $7 (inflation and fame?) and is probably less fatty then the usual hainanese chicken rice variety.On the whole, the great taste of the white meat in curry broth is very memorable. Bean sprouts is pleasantly crunchy. Watch the shirt and sleeves or you will be spotted! Not a good idea if you have a meeting next to attend.Sorry no photos here."

There's a reason why this stall at Hong Lim is so popular. Only one offering on their menu, in large or small, with the large having more meat and the option to choose your cut of the chicken. But the small is quite sufficient. You'll get a healthy amount of chicken with your curry and noodles (choose between yellow noodles or bee hoom or get a mix of both), in addition to dou pok, potato, fishcake and bean sprouts - all deliciously soaking up the broth for more flavor. Literally tastes like home and nearly identical to how my aunt makes it, which made me even more homesick. The broth was creamy, flavorful and with just enough of a kick. I usually don't like chicken breast but wow, this was tender and juicy. Be patient as you'll most likely encounter a long line. The locals obviously know what's up and that's def a stamp of approval!"

One day this year, emboldened with a book in hand, I decided to just queue for the heck of it. You could say my curiosity got the better of me - and, now I totally understand the cause for the queue. It must be the curry gravy - you would think having a whole bowl of curry noodles would probably make you feel sick but they have managed to keep the rich coconuty gravy tasty without being too heavy. Then again, maybe it is the chicken? Paired with generous slices of fish cake and potato, the slices of meat are always extra tender. Or maybe it is the chilli paste that they add last that adds another dimension of flavour to the dish?I don't know what it is exactly but thumbs up. Only attempt if you are patient or queue seems sane enough."

It's no fault of the location, because who sits outdoors in the midday sun on one of the hottest days of the year unless you're trying to get a tan or an expat?! While that choice did not make things better, the real reason the meal was extremely average was the overall taste of all the dishes. Of all the items that we ordered, there were two hits and two complete misses. To clarify, I came here for the set lunches which are 25++ for starter, main and tea or coffee. The setting is reminiscent of a cafe by a cobblestone paved street in France and it was one of those days where I needed the peace the memory invoked. The price is fairly reasonable for the quantity. The burratina in the salad showed promise (it does say 'mozzarella bar') but the truffle oil with chickpeas soup was a complete disappointment. It's partly my fault for not asking what kind of chickpea soup but that combination was atrocious and oddly bland coupled with my dislike for truffle. The leaves were a bit old but nothing criminal. Then came my sliced beef main - rather well done, but with disappointing roast potatoes and a tasteless salad as sides. The second main was the fresh pasta, bolognaise, a very salty and overpowering dish that felt too heavy after the first few bites. The coffee and tea at the end was just average, not artisanal or anything.If you're expecting finer cuisine like I was, given the venue and prices, I think you might be left disappointed. However, I've heard the dinners are far better so perhaps I'd change my review some day."

Duxton is a nice chill out area that is not crazy busy. Plus after a whole day of rain, the weather was at a nice cool 24 degrees, perfect for outdoor dining!Menu is not big. Love places where they just focus on what they do well. As the name suggest, this is a mozzarella bar, so this cheese is featured on a whole page of the menu.We started with two types: one wrapped around truffle, arugula and prosciutto. Beautiful. How do you go wrong with a combination like that. The mozzarella goes well with the saltiness of the ham and the bitterness of the leaves..and you are spoilt further with black truffles. Genius.The second one we had was a creamier mozzarella served on top of a bed of grilled zucchini. Delish too as this mozzarella has a much richer taste and texture. A great contrast to the first. We can't decide which one we like better.Main course we had the special of the day: a wagyu beef steak. Done perfectly medium rare, charred on the outside and lightly pink inside. Meat was succulent and moist with a great bite.The second main course is the spaghetti with mussels in a white wine sauce. On first mouth, I thought it was a tad salty. But the sweetness of the seafood broth with lots of garlic and white wine came through as you eat. Their spaghetti is very thin, even thinner than the usual linguine. Almost like an angel hair. Done al dente. Very nice.We ended the meal with dessert. Lemon panda cotta with strawberries in balsamic reduction. The panda cotta is not sweet like some places and really smooth. Yum too.Service was great as we were served by Kirby who recommended everything. After the two appetizers, we basically told him to just get us what he likes most from the menu for the rest of our meal and we ended up leaving very happy."

Unfortunately, no more spaces indoors (or, not much, anyway). Outdoors is pretty, but it's really hot and the fans helped alleviate the heat only slightly. It was a little tougher to get the attention of the servers outside, but as more people sat down that wasn't as bad. I think al fresco in the evening would be really nice though! Lovely setting with the shophouses behind.I was starving by the time we got there (long walk from office :p) and so was very thankful for the bread + olive oil/balsamic vinegar (although somehow I couldn't get at much of the balsamic vinegar :( think it had sunk beneath the oil!). Piping hot from the oven and deliciously crisp on the outside, warm on the inside, and fluffy!!! I love their bread.Both of us had the restaurant week menu. Pan-fried buffalo milk mozzarella wrapped in parma ham. 3 mozzarella balls! Very nice presentation. Parma ham wrapped around each ball with some herbs sprinkled on top, with some rocket and cherry tomato wedge in each little compartment of the 3-part dish. I found the ham a bit slightly (but never really like ham anyway), balsamic reduction that came with was sweet and hence a good foil! I chose the seafood cacciucco while bf had the lambshank. Lamb was tender, falling off the bone with a prod of the fork. Delicious sauce! He said he could taste the cream/butter in the mashed potatoes. I actually didn't find the cacciucco remarkable, but again I don't really have anything much to compare it to. Nice tomato-y broth, light, fair amount of seafood (clams, fish, prawns, squid, all well cooked, not too tough or anything). Two thin slices of toast (rosemary/sea salt sprinkled, I think?) and of course, I mopped up the soup with the rest of the delicious bread!Dessert - red wine pear with mascarpone mousse and chocolate shavings. Delicious! A tad on the sweet side, but nicely poached pear and mousse went together well."

Their burrata and other mozzerellas are definitely worth the trip. We had the classic burrata and the stracciatella with roasted zucchini, and I could've been happy with just those two cheeses and some bread. But on top of that, we also had eggplant parmigiana, which I thought was actually a little too heavy on the cheese and too light on the eggplant. The flavor was still good, though. Finally, for the entree we shared the roast lamb shanks, which were tasty and tender, if a little gamey - but I think lamb shank is pretty much always gamey, right?Aside from the food, the service was knowledgable, fast, and friendly. The lighting and ambiance inside are nice, but something about the acoustics make it really noisy for the size and number of people in that space.

The crab linguine wasn't quite as awesome as my favourite at Kith Cafe but was still pretty great. Probably a little too much sauce smothering, it rendered the dish less than delicate.I also really liked the lamb and the risotto.

The interiors are inspired, too, and they have unique light fixtures and beautiful furniture.They serve Italian cuisine with a focus on mozarella - it appears in lots of the entrees.

The sauce was very good:  flavorful but not heavy. And the serving sizes were satisfying. Now the bad. 1) Service was friendly (I always appreciate that), but terrible. There was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, so it took a long time to get served, we had to ask for things multiple times because he kept forgetting, and some things never came at all. 2) I don't often say this, but the gnocchi was too firm. Almost rubbery. 3) I ordered the squash risotto, and found it completely flavorless and a bit chalky. 4) Worst of all, we ordered two mozzarella dishes and they tasted like Philadelphia cream cheese.

We thought it was strange that the tabbouleh, fried cauliflower and remaining bread hadn't arrived, so we asked the server about it. He never got back to us. We asked again when a few other dishes came, and still did not get an answer about the appetizers. An hour later we got fed up with the service, and told the staff to cancel the rest of the dishes and get us the bill. He left without a word and got us the bill - didn't bother to check what happened, didn't bother to apologize, and acted as if this was a regular occurrence.

It came with a side of sweet potato fries and coleslaw. Normally, I'm not a fan of either of these sides because of their oily, mayonais-y aftertaste but Afterglow's healthy spin made me simply love them!  The main menu offers Raw Lasagne (priced for $20) but the waitress strongly suggested that we try the ""Today's special's: Raw Crispy Lasagne"", which has a extra layer of dehydrated tomato and  Macedonia cheese for the extra crunch. Though the dish was interesting and presented well, the flavor and texture didn't impress me as much as the mushroom-feta burger. Though I liked the substitution of thinly sliced zucchini instead of the actual pasta, it failed to accentuate the tomato sauce flavor. I also was expecting the dish to be warm but it turned out to be cold, and I think I prefer my lasagne warm :PIf I could, I would rate this place a 3.5 for it's delicious burger and ambiance! But sadly the lasagne was a disappointment and the place felt a bit too cozy.  Would I go back there again? I would, just because I would like to give this place another try with their other selections and desserts. Pro:-Romantic setting -Creative dishes-Healthy, raw choicesCons:-Too cozy with little privacy -Expensive-Hard to see the Today's Special's Menu from seating-No wifi"

Vegan cheese. I guess if you squint and pretend that the only cheese you've ever eaten is cream cheese, then this MAY fool you in to thinking it's cheese. In all honestly it's nothing like cheese but it's bloody delicious and I'm pretty sure I ate more than half of my share of what was a shared dish. The crackers it came with were really good smeared with our ""cheese"" made from pinenuts.  This is an absolute must order if you dine here.On a later visit I sat for half an hour, stole the free wifi and drank a coconut water.

The star of the meal was definitely the homemade kimchi nori rolls. These are sushi rice rolls packed with kimchi and chickpeas and god knows what vegetables, but they are irresistable. Super yummy, and tastes healthy at the same time. The soups were good, but nothing to shout about. The nut cheese was interesting, being a cheese made without any dairy, but I thought it was a tad overpriced. The avocado sashimi rice (forbidden rice, avocado, roasted edamame, other vegetables) was very tasty with a hint of sesame oil, but the portion was quite small. The quinoa rice was very bland, don't get it. Will be back for the nori rolls for sure! Good craft beer selection as well, and comfy, relaxed environment."

I suspect someone is sleeping and didn't take the food out immediately after it's cooked. What a waste.Selected wing beans, paper wrapped chicken and kueh kosui.Winged bean too finely cut. Was much better when Chef was at Folklore. Pork rib was there but no sight of pork belly.Kueh kosui was nice and soft but a tad too sweet for my liking."

He said just lunch items. So Guiga Korean BBQ is located at the Tanjong Pagar area. To sum up, I never like the location. The place is just not vibing with me. Even the birds there looked different and strange. FOOD 4/5The banchan served was really good!! My Bangyetamg (Ginseng Chicken Soup) was really good! Was it life changing? No, but it was very good. I had the soup with the bowl of rice given. Ramyun was disappointing! The broth has a strong bell pepper flavor. Not sure why they would put bell peppers in ramyun, maybe it was something I did not know. It was one bad ramyun!SERVICE 3/5Adequate service was rendered. The staff was robotic (the bad kind), placed my brother's dish on the side of the table and another of his in front of me. Put my bangyetang in front of my brother. My brother has to move those bowls and plates around. I complained to my brother, he said it was fine. As usual, my brother was the kindest of us all.AMBIANCE 3/5When I walked in, I smelled some cigarette odor. I was told maybe it was from the bbq/hood/grill. I don't know, I did not know all the above could smell like cigarette :( It was not a big restaurant, somewhat dim. Maybe that was what a hole in the wall meant? I don't know, too dark (not the romantic kind) for me. Maybe it would be charming for other people.Glad my brother wanted to go Barisart for coffee/ tea after lunch. Again, I just followed him around, at least he was very mindful and sweet when we walked around those old shop houses with him cautioning me of those steps so I would not fall.

It is, after all a Korean BBQ place!Our order:- Yukgaejang (): A hearty, spicy beef soup that's highly popular in Korea. Made with shredded beef, lots of scallions and other vegetables such as gosari (fernbrake fiddleheads), beansprouts, and mushrooms, this is a substantial soup that has great depth of flavor. If you love this but can't take too much spiciness, you can ask them to tone down the spice factor. Absolutely love this!- BiBimBap (): The so-called ultimate comfort Korean food. My friend's order was surprisingly just nice for her; not too much rich. The sauce was simply delicious though it might be slightly hot for some so be careful with the portion.The cold noodles () on the menu looks delicious and I will definitely be back to try it soon!P.s. the waitresses have a korean look but speaks very fluent chinese."

I'm not korean but I think I have a taste for good korean food.  I found Guiga to be better than average.  I like the way they prepared their marinated galbi.  But the meat was a little fatty and wasnt a lot of it.  We got the beef platter which was supposed to be for 2-3 people but I found it barely fed 2.  They didnt serve bulgogi and I'm always amazed by korean places that dont have it on the menu.  The banchan (sides) were ok.  Not really all that impressive but better than the places that just serve kimchi.  Now I didnt order any other the other dishes since there was just 2 people. The menu actually looked pretty good.  I may go back again and try some of the other items on the menu.  Overall I'd say it was good for a KBBQ fix but didnt really wow me.

I think it is quite a good incentive for diners to eat and go instead of lingering and chatting among themselves long after the food is gone, and a big crowd is waiting outside for a table. Having read about the crowd if you go at the usual dinner time, we decided to go early and arrived around 6pm. The place was already half filled by then. At around 7pm, there was a line of people waiting for a table and it was only a Monday night. Having spied the early bird special of getting 20% off, we decided to try to leave by 730pm and let others have our table. A feat as we had two friends who only arrived close to 7pm and had just 30 minutes to finish the food. They ran out of the watermelon shell for the watermelon soju so we skipped that. Instead we tried the corn cheese which was really just average. A bit too creamy and cheesy that it was quite jelat (very rich) after a while and it was already shared by 4. The ganjang chicken wings (soy sauce) were really good and I must say I prefer the wings to the actual fried chicken pieces. The fried chicken were cut into 4 pieces and the breast meat was a bit on the dry side and not that enjoyable after a while. It would be worse if you did not order the chicken with any sauce. We had spicy up (not that spicy after all) and yangnyum up (like sweet and sour sauce with a bit of spice). The skin was crispy and delicious and the meat (except breast meat) moist and tender.I think 4 diners are just the right group size to try 2 different types of fried chicken and a side of chicken wings as you get 2 chicken pieces and a chicken wing. It may be different if you are very hungry or have a group of guys. The buffet is still available though they limit a 2 hour window for that."

The fries was tasty with beef that wasn't overly cooked. The stew was a tad too sweet and spicy for my liking. The watermelon soju was interesting but taste wise I think it's mediocre. I tried to make reservations an hour before I arrived and the staff curtly told told me to just show up because reservations are not necessary. When I arrived, the place was full.

I didn't pay attention and a little of the soup went down the wrong pipe and I was coughing and tearing for a long time. That said, it's actually not outrightly spicy if you are careful.

Rejoice! I think I have found my go-to drinking and KFC place on the island. The variety, the vibe, and the sheer portions of the chicken is indeed one up from the rest.The moment you walk into Chicken Up, you feel this warmth about the place- Kpop featured on the big screen, beer and soju all around, call buttons for service... this feels a bit like home (Ktown LA). Simulated and having the concept of ""rounds"" when partying in Korea, I believe that Chicken Up is perfect for ""Ee-Cha"" (2nd round- more drinking and noshing on snacks) before heading out for Karaoke. Something that Singaporeans should really start adapting to.Lets get on with the food, shall we?Original Fried Chicken: Amazing. The skin is fried perfectly and well seasoned, while the meat is super juicy and moist. Honestly delicious. It takes me back to the ones in Korea.I don't even know why real KFC or Popeye's exist when you can have this chicken. Seriously, one of the best.Soy Chicken Wings: Also a delicious marinade. 4 wings, large and meaty with ample soy garlic. Very delicious.Sweet & Spicy Chicken: A bit too sweet for my liking, was hoping to have a bit more kick, but equally delicious.  They also serve a ""popcorn chicken"" version of this sauce the comes boneless. **Tip for all you Americanized people- this is the closest to Orange Chicken you will get in Singapore. Screw Panda Express, Chicken Up's popcorn chicken + a bowl of rice may very well be my go-to meal at least once a week. It's THAT good.**Odeng Tang (Fishcake soup): I was feeling a bit under the weather but the spicy broth hit the spot.  The portion of fishcake was VERY generous.Cheese Corn: Gooey, Rich, Creamy- honestly perfect for beer.Truffle Fries: Ample seasoning, good portion for sharing.Beverages: Korean drinks, Hite, Soju, Draft, Asahi, Maggoli, you name it, they have it. Outstanding.Only downfall- the radish cubes were not marinated as well as I liked it to be, but this is a very minor detail.so, why come to Chicken Up? 3 reasons.1. $25 AYCE Chicken Dinner, with $15 AYCD Beer top up. Best deal in town. Perfect for guys2. Perfect place to unwind with your friends, snack, nosh, and catch up on Kpop3. Large and delicious portions and a good variety of Anju (Korean Tapas) Now all they need is a noribang next door and my Ktown experience would be complete here in Singapore."

The dude and I are not buffet people. We took the buffet because it made sense to pay $25 to try a few flavors since even though he's half Korean, we both had no idea what Yamyung (?) or Andong stew was. Not being buffet people, we were therefore also set on just enjoying a slow meal, appreciating the flavors and talking instead of trying to cram as much food as possible down our gut.Here's the problem.The fried chicken here is really, really good. I would say it ranks second or slightly on par with No. 5's har cheong gai in terms of fried chicken execution. Very crisp on the outside even after the chicken has cooled, ridiculously juicy on the inside. We had the soy sauce, spicy, curry and popcorn flavors and then a stew each. The stew is quite light and we love the kick from the chillis bouncing off the sweet sauce.Ended up eating way too fast, probably too much and we were very full. Happy too. The ""truffle"" fries (there's really sparse specks of truffle shavings in the salt) were nothing to scream about but they were well fried too. The salad was wilted.

We walked out of there feeling really sick. Really really sick and swearing off fried chicken for the next few months or year. That's because the chicken cuts are pretty big. Like KFC size pieces. So it's not the same as eating wings elsewhere. Go slow... And pace yourself. They took really long serving our chicken so we stuffed our faces with those oily bits and were so happy until that feeling kicked in. Also go for the cheese corn.

It is essentially a 1-litre mug of Heineken draught. Yep, 1-litre! Not difficult to understand why I like the place, eh? On to the food. Not your usual traditional Korean fare and not quite KFC. One of the side dishes is actually steamed Korean dumplings which are light and delightful, an excellent contrast to the fried chicken. All patrons also gets served free salad and pickles the moment you place your orders. Definitely good to partake in a little greens before the unhealthy stuff.  The chicken is served spicy or spicier, Korean chilli style! Crispier than crisp on the outside; soft, juicy and tender on the inside. Recently, South Korea's plans for world domination through the incredibly formulaic yet insanely infectious kpop has been gathering pace at an alarming rate. One fortunate by-product is Chicken Up ending up on our shores. This tiny eatery is everything Korean down to their staff, most of the regulars and the insanely annoying yet addictive kpop tunes and programmes broadcasting on their tv.

That was an interesting experience as most restaurant does not really gives attention to someone who dine alone.I would like to go back there again to try out different soju and meals. This is surely a comeback place for me.  I'm not as sober today as i'm keeping up to my word in writing a review for Chicken up ! Thanks for the card it made me remember my promise you know what i mean !"

My favourite was the soy chicken wings, but the others were pretty good too. Crispy outside, moist inside. I don't have much to carp about on the food front.Bad news: The service is awful. 2 servers on a Sunday night sounds ok for a small eatery, right? Problem is, they're forgetful. We didn't get our drinks till after the chicken arrived, and only because I asked. The 2nd round of drinks was also forgotten. 2 tables away, it emerged that they hadn't gotten their chicken because the server thought that they were having the chicken buffet option (they weren't, although I fail to see how that should affect their food service). Salad is supposed to be complimentary. We got none. When I asked (presumably the owner),  he said pretty apologetically that they were probably out. Dude. First, you're open till 2am, and it wasn't even 10pm yet. Secondly, why did we have to ASK to hear that you were out of salad? It should have been said upfront.In sum: If there's another voucher-type deal, we might go again, but otherwise, I'd be willing to pay more for less forgetful and sloppy service."

I work at Tanjong Pagar and decided to walk in for dinner with my sister. I was greeted by the staffs friendly smile and korean music(though im not a huge fan). The ambience made it welcoming. Initially, i wanted to try their various types of chicken. However, their portioning was too much for 2 person, and the staff recommended us to take their buffet which was $25 for all we can eat chicken. Additional $15 for free flow beer which we thought was worth it. Therefore, we decided on the buffet.They provide free flow salad before the food arrives, so we had something to munch on while waiting for the food. We had Spicy Up, Mild Up, Curry Up, Yangyum, Soya Chicken, Andong Stew and Popcorn Chicken.My personal favorite would be the Andong and Soya Chicken. Both of them are very mouth savoring. Very tasty and will defintely crave for them in the future.The free flow beer was a really good deal as we love drinking beer and that the beer goes well with the fried chicken.Compared to elsewhere, the chicken here isnt as oily. The flour isnt as thick and therefore perfect to me. I spent $44 per person.Must tries: Soya chicken, Andong Chicken Stew, Spicy UpI also recommend this place for:Ala Carte, Buffet, Dinner, Supper"

It wasn't fresh and was hardly crusty.The nachos were excellent, mixing cheesy goodness (proper cheese and not American cheese) and tender flavourful pulled pork. It was very big for a side. Although it was served with thousand island dip, it was flavourful enough as is was and I found that the dip just confused the flavour profile.Unfortunately, the service here was bad, even for Singapore.I went to the back of the shop to see if the water was self service, saw that it was not, and then asked the female staff member for 2 cups of iced water. She then barked at me, and I quote, ""Go away. Not self service"". I don't think any service staff in Singapore has ever been so rude to me.The cashier also had a very sian (bored/tired) manner and spoke in a monotone when I placed my order (though she brightened up a little later).Lastly, my nachos took more than 40 minutes to come, and I had to remind the staff once.As such I am docking off a star from my rating of this place due to the bad service (and probably also the lack of air conditioning, which was very noticeable at lunchtime)."

Toasts with kaya and butter tasted good. Kaya carried a sweet taste. It's a new experience for me. For the beverage, I ordered mixed tea and coffee. The taste was unique. I believed they used  condensed milk to make the beverage because the sweetness didn't seems to come from the sugar. Since the hotel gave me the voucher and it covered the bill for my order.

Even though it appeared to be a very small portion size, it was pretty filling. The kaya (coconut jam) was in a little bowl on the side, and added a nice coconut flavor to the toast.The service speed was a little slow.

We normally begin with a cider or cocktail, but they do have mocktails available as well. We often times start with the Halim Bademjan ($13), which is pureed eggplant with braised, tender lamb and green lentils, garnished with sun-dried yougurt and mint sauce. It's basically babaganoush and is a wonderful appetizer, but not Paleo if paired with their bread. They will bring you cut up veggies if you request, and it's delicious! The hummus ($10) is also a great option, but still a Paleo cheat.I've also had the Soup E Jow ($11), which features barley, herbs, vegetables and chicken. The North Dakota girl in me adores this comfort-food soup, but the Paleo angel on my shoulder disapproves! Our go to entree is the Shabestan Platter for Two ($95).

Turns out, it was just their regular lunch menu.The deal includes soup of the day, a main course (from a limited list) and dessert, along with a soft drink.For the soup of the day, we got the Ash-Reshth and Soup-E-Jow. The former is vegetarian and had these Persian noodles stewing in a soup of cilantro, spinach and herbs. It was alright. I'm not sure how Persian noodles are supposed to be cooked like but it was a tad overcooked for me. The Soup-E-Jow was sort of a Persian take on chicken soup and it tasted great.We selected the Lamb Kubideh and Zereshk Polo with Chicken. The Zereshk dish was so-so. It seemed like the chicken curry my mum would make but my friend thought otherwise. However, the saffron rice with pomegranates and pistachios that accompanied the dish was amazing. It was wonderfully flavoured. The Lamb Kubideh won me over, hands down. It was juicy and just thinking about it right now has got me salivating!! It was just fresh and a definite must try! As for dessert,  we each got a scoop of Persian saffron ice cream with chopped pistachios. Ah...it was really good. Not too sweet and cleansed the palette very well.This place is a definite must try!"

What I liked were: location, service, food, ambience. But ultimately, the price point was a bit high for the experience. We sat inside, and ordered the platter for two and the hummus app. The food is good considering there isnt much competition for Persian cuisine in Singapore. Meats were well seasoned, and the portions are generous, which I find true for most Persian restaurants. The lamb and chicken were definitely the highlights, but I would've liked to try a salad as well. I'd recommend you under order on the protein/platter (get a platter for 2 as a table of 3), so you can try another app or salad. Also, remember to ask for a small serving of garlic yogurt and chili padi sauce. They're delicious and help bring everything together. If you come for dinner, then you might also be welcomed by some lively music and belly dancing. I enjoy dinner entertainment, but if prefer privacy ask for a table inside -it's less audible. We ended up paying $189, which was the premise of the 3 stars, but I'd come back. The food is good, and I think you can fare better with a little menu hacking and a bigger group."

I always demand something spicy whether it's chili flakes, chili padi, chopped jalapeño or grilled peppers. Not only did the host/manager give me and my fiancé two big bowls of mouthwatering spicy sauce each, he also made sure I had plenty of green peppers on the side, grilled to perfection.

We normally begin with a cider or cocktail, but they do have mocktails available as well. We often times start with the Halim Bademjan ($13), which is pureed eggplant with braised, tender lamb and green lentils, garnished with sun-dried yougurt and mint sauce. It's basically babaganoush and is a wonderful appetizer, but not Paleo if paired with their bread. They will bring you cut up veggies if you request, and it's delicious! The hummus ($10) is also a great option, but still a Paleo cheat.I've also had the Soup E Jow ($11), which features barley, herbs, vegetables and chicken. The North Dakota girl in me adores this comfort-food soup, but the Paleo angel on my shoulder disapproves! Our go to entree is the Shabestan Platter for Two ($95). It comes with minced lamb, chicken, fish, prawn, and a lamb or beef fillet. We always opt for the beef.In addition to the food, they have a belly dancer on Friday evenings, beginning around 8:00 pm. It's never too hard to get a table here, and we've had luck every time even when we haven't made reservations."

Turns out, it was just their regular lunch menu.The deal includes soup of the day, a main course (from a limited list) and dessert, along with a soft drink.For the soup of the day, we got the Ash-Reshth and Soup-E-Jow. The former is vegetarian and had these Persian noodles stewing in a soup of cilantro, spinach and herbs. It was alright. I'm not sure how Persian noodles are supposed to be cooked like but it was a tad overcooked for me. The Soup-E-Jow was sort of a Persian take on chicken soup and it tasted great.We selected the Lamb Kubideh and Zereshk Polo with Chicken. The Zereshk dish was so-so. It seemed like the chicken curry my mum would make but my friend thought otherwise. However, the saffron rice with pomegranates and pistachios that accompanied the dish was amazing. It was wonderfully flavoured. The Lamb Kubideh won me over, hands down. It was juicy and just thinking about it right now has got me salivating!! It was just fresh and a definite must try! As for dessert,  we each got a scoop of Persian saffron ice cream with chopped pistachios. Ah...it was really good. Not too sweet and cleansed the palette very well.This place is a definite must try!"

What I liked were: location, service, food, ambience. But ultimately, the price point was a bit high for the experience. We sat inside, and ordered the platter for two and the hummus app. The food is good considering there isnt much competition for Persian cuisine in Singapore. Meats were well seasoned, and the portions are generous, which I find true for most Persian restaurants. The lamb and chicken were definitely the highlights, but I would've liked to try a salad as well. I'd recommend you under order on the protein/platter (get a platter for 2 as a table of 3), so you can try another app or salad. Also, remember to ask for a small serving of garlic yogurt and chili padi sauce. They're delicious and help bring everything together. If you come for dinner, then you might also be welcomed by some lively music and belly dancing. I enjoy dinner entertainment, but if prefer privacy ask for a table inside -it's less audible. We ended up paying $189, which was the premise of the 3 stars, but I'd come back. The food is good, and I think you can fare better with a little menu hacking and a bigger group."

I always demand something spicy whether it's chili flakes, chili padi, chopped jalapeño or grilled peppers. Not only did the host/manager give me and my fiancé two big bowls of mouthwatering spicy sauce each, he also made sure I had plenty of green peppers on the side, grilled to perfection.

You can make your own including a base, protein (salmon, tuna, chicken breast, sirloin) and toppings galore.

The dining area were half filled with customers and hence we were able to choose to sit on a high chair or normal seating arrangements. Personally, I have not had poke bowls ever since I stepped out of California. Hence this make-your-own bowl concept was intriguing especially with the vast varieties of items that you could add onto your bowl. For the base, I ordered Signature Sushi Rice. For the flavor, I ordered Spicy Mayo Salmon and Spicy Garlic Sesame Tuna (additional cost). For the toppings, Pineapple, Edamame, Nori Flakes, Lime Avocado and Spiced Roasted cashews (some of them are with additional costs).Decided to sit on one of the high tables. On the side, there was a serving table with ""dressings"" that you could add onto the poke bowl. The colors of my bowl looked vibrant and it definitely made me to dig in straightaway.The combination was perfect. I love each and every ingredients I chose. Each of them have distinct tastes which combined the dish well - crunchy, sweet, sour, spicy.. The must tries are the roasted cashews, tuna and salmon. This place's interior design made the surroundings to be homey. Service was fast but a little pricey. But overall, I enjoyed my meal and will be back again in the near future."

It tastes a little better than it does in the US. The food has a really good quality that you can only see in Singapore. I know poke is still new in Singapore and I have to say they did a really good job of making my order. After you pick your base you can get the same ingredients that you see in an American poke joint. If you are a hardcore addict of poke you can add the premium ingredients for an extra cost. Here they have drinks and won't overcharge you no matter what you get. I love the smoothie they have. Tastes real authentic and is perfect for lunch.It's a place where many millennial can have a work or school break. The staff here is real happy and really care for the customer. Getting a to go is good as well because you can pair it with some Milo. The price is good if you are an US tourist. Come here whether you are a poke fan or not

And maybe one or two items of flair. I think the ""poke wars"" of 2016 have made diversifying a priority for competitive differentiation between poke shops. Too bad poke is a commodity and should stay that way. Complexity dilutes taste. But if you don't care about taste and would rather queue up to spend money on a glorified bouquet. Go ahead.

Let's start with quick tips for first timers:1. Cats are not dogs. If you keep dangling the toy and they're not taking the bait, it's not going to happen. Also, some cats are just not into petting so if you're trying to touch it and it's shying away, please stop2. Let the cat come to you. Sit down near it, on the floor. Let them smell your hands before touching them. Respecting the cat will allow you to earn their trust the quickest.3. MOST IMPORTANT TIP: Try to ask the employees if you can see the cats and the room before signing up for an hour. You should see if the cats are in a napping mood, or if the other patrons are interacting in a way that you can enjoy. I actually ended up leaving 10 minutes early because a pushy group of 10 people came in and started being loud and bothering the cats. Before, it was myself, and a local couple and a German couple, and we were totally fine. Check the situation before you commit! This is the single most important piece of advice I can give you for enjoying your cat cafe experience.Alright, as for the experience itself:PRICING: I don't think S$14 is expensive for an hour and a drink (the complimentary drink can be mineral water or coke). Think about how much it costs to raise a cat and realize some of your money goes to support causes to take care of catsDRINKS: I got the special, a Thai Iced Tea. It was an additional $2.50 on top, but I think it was fairly priced. Was it worth it? Not really, nothing special here. The latte art for the coffee based drinks seemed decent. And for some other hot drinks, they give you a nice ceramic cover to keep your drink warm and the cat hair out.CATS: Definitely a range of characters here. Elliot was my favorite, a long-haired softie. There are a few cats that seem like not really people cats, cats that would naturally avoid everyone. It would be great if people could not think of cat cafes as petting zoos, but as cafes that happen to have cats. So enjoy doing something else while appreciating cats while you can. Overall, there were about 7 cats when I visited but at least 3 were sleeping basically the entire time. AGAIN, CHECK THE ROOM BEFORE YOU COMMIT- if it's nap time, come back later.INTERACTION: They do appreciate cat treats, and the staff will occasionally give people cat treats to give to cats. I think it's a good thing that you can't buy unlimited cat treats because people would ultimately overfeed the cats to get their attention. This isn't good for making $$$, but it's definitely better for the cats. Well done, management.ROOM: Nicely decorated and ventilated, not too cold. You can hear noise from the street but it's not bad. There's a number of seats, I bet the room could seat 10 max. However, due to the distribution of cats, people will naturally concentrate in certain areas. There are plenty of cat structures. Overall, I'm giving 3 stars. To be honest, it's not the fault of the management per se as to why I felt that this was a 3 star experience. Here's why: First of all, half the cats were asleep when I came (Saturday afternoon), but I know cats sleep for over 14 hours a day, I have cats. I should have checked the room before I committed.Second, of the cats that were awake, there were a few that just weren't really into interaction. I think it's food that the cats are sourced from bad situations, but perhaps they could select more of the cats that are proven to be forwardly-friendly. I've met cats like this before, I know they exist. Third and most importantly, the group that came in during my last 20 minutes. A group of 10 Chinese kids (probably college age) that were fairly loud, shoving around to take photos of the cats. I was sitting there just chilling with this cat and one of these guys started taking pictures of me with the cat and I just felt really awkward. Again, for my first half hour, I was here with a German couple and a Singaporean couple and we were all polite and respecting each others' space and it was great. This really soured the experience for me and this is why I left a bit early.OVERALL - an A-OK experience. I might swing by singapore again and visit the other cat cafe nearby Bugis and give some comparison feedback."

To my dismay, Saigon Cafe is owned and run by the same person who owns Viet Inn by Raffles Place/Boat Quay! Even the menu is identical. The set menu special offer is identical too! They also own Saigon Lotus at Marina Square.Despite that initial bit of news, we ordered dinner.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?The char siew here was very good, although I'm continually surprised that there's so much bone and other inedibles in the mix. On that same note, the duck had so many little inedible bits and pieces in it that it was entirely impossible to eat, which was disappointing.

Oh, and rice too if you prefer that.The star is undoubtedly the char siew, closely followed by the siu yok. The char siew is a delicious combination of fat, lean meat and charred exterior that really hits the spot. You will probably end up with a couple of slices of char siew that are all fat and you can ignore them because really, a little fat goes a long way. If you're really squeamish about the amount of fat on your meat, you can request for leaner portions.Place your order at the stall with whomever's holding a notepad (usually a lady) and choose between the warm and humid coffee shop interior or the hot and warm-airy outside. Either way, you're going to have to wait if the tables are filled because the food takes a while to get to your table. Going in the evening makes for a more comfortable dining experience but don't dawdle because they close at 8pm.Get your green chilli and chilli sauce yourself from the side of the stall. The chilli sauce is provides a nice acidic and spicy kick and goes perfect with the meats. Drinks and ice are also self-service from the fridges and are at a standard price of $1 per can."

It essentially is a roasted meat shop that conveniently sells drinks too. Well, a roasted meat shop that just happens to sell my favourite wanton mee in singapore. It definitely helps that the roasted char siew is done the way it should be, the way that many char siew shops around the country just can't seem to get right. I've never been a fan of char siew that is painted in artificial red; for me that is the surest warning sign that I'm not in for a good one. The colour of this roast pork is a sweet, deep, caramel brown, quietly revealing the time, effort and skill that resulted in this creation. Oh, and they are not stingy in their portion of this beautiful meat -at all-.And then the noodles are absolutely perfect. The noodles are silky yet softly solid, and as you slurp them be careful of not splashing the wonderfully savoury and sweet sauce all around you, and I have clumsily managed to do on so many occasions, probably because of how slippery and smooth the texture of the noodles are. The wantons are good too - a little mixture of texture in it, with the smooth soft skin on the outside and some crunchy bits within the minced meat within. The soup's pretty good too. I think you get the point - it's all really good, but I'm not making it sound as good as it is probably because of how GREAT the noodles and the char siew are.If that doesn't draw you in, maybe the little price of $4 for the whole shebang will tempt you"

The restaurant itself is pretty huge for SG standards and able to accommodate multiple huge parties. When you sit down, you're given a menu to order your dim sum items. There aren't any food carts they push around. However, the service was slow, so you should expect to wait and extended period of time to receive your food. (Average 30 mins, minus a star there).

I ordered the following:- Steamed BBQ pork  (Recommend)- Crystal Chieves  dumpling - Fried Sweet Potatoes w/scallop    (Recommend)- Xiao Long Bao- Rice Porridge w/Century egg- Lotus leaf Rice    Keep in mind the portions are smaller than your typical Dim sum restaurant.  So if you're starving, you should order one extra one.

Yum Cha also sells seafood dishes like signature salted egg prawns and even chilli crabs. They've been at this location for the past 16 years, and they also provide delivery services.For the upcoming Mother's Day in May, Yum Cha has created a new concept that will be avaialble from 1st-14th May at Yum Cha Chinatown and Yum Cha Changi outlets. Their goal is to re-create the long-lost taste of traditional Chinese dishes that mother and grandmothers would remember with nostalgia of their hometowns.1. Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetable Bun $2/BunA nostalgic classic dish, this delicious bun, which was eaten for days while our ancestors were fleeing the war in China before settling down in different parts of Asia. The quality tender pork belly is braised in Yum Cha's secret recipe sauce for hours to create a sweet and succulent taste that is balanced by a soft and fluffy steamed bun.This is quite a different kind of bun as it is pillowy and has a slight fragance to it. The meat was indeed juicy, tasty and I can imagine getting about 3 of these in a go. Definitely don't miss this!2. Fish Maw with Shrimp PasteThis was an interesting dish that I had never tried before. The shrimp paste itself was a huge generous serving and it was extremely tasty going with the sauce on the dish. The fish maw was soft and jelly like, adding a light texture to the meaty shrimp paste.3. Pan Fried Salted Fish Bun $5 for 3 piecesYet another traditional chinese dish originating from the Guangdong provnice, this salted fish bun used to be a favourite of the Emperor Kang Xi  of the Qing Dynasty. The bottom bun is seared to a golden brown, with a flavourful filling made from salted fish paste and minced meat. To enhance its flavour, Yum Cha has added a secret seasoning for a more savoury experience. This was one of my favourites of the night. The bun was soft and pillow but yet had a slight crisp on the edges. The salted fish wasn't too salty and was perfect for my taste buds. 4. Pumpkin, Yam, and Golden Cake $4.80 for 3 pieces *highly recommended*A very pretty dish was served with this flower. The exterior of the golden cake was definitely beyong my expectations. It was extremely crispy, biscuit-like and biting into it, you will taste the moist yam and the sweet pumpkin in the center. A pretty ingenious sweet dish in my opinion. Definitely don't miss this. It's not that sweet, it was more of a savoury dish.5. Signature Salted Egg PrawnsI was waiting all night to try this. This was a huge serving of fresh and crunchy prawns. In the center, was a salad that had the salted egg sauce. This was a very different presentation than what we normally see, whereby the prawns are deshellled and cooked in salted egg sauce. 6. Black Pepper Lotus Beef (Large, $48)I loved the presentation of this dish, delicate and beautifully plated. The lotus were thinly sliced and were crisp like a potato chip. The vegetables added some colour to the black pepper beef. The Black pepper beef wasn't spicy at all, which is great for non-spicy eaters such as myself. The beef itself was extremely tender, soft and juicy.  The beef itself is imported from Brazil!7. Crab Meat Xiao Long BaoMy personal favourite dim sum is xiao long bao and Yum Cha's rendition of this delicacy is pimped up with crab meat. Picking it up with chopsticks usually requires some skill so as to not burst the delicate xiao long bao skin. But I could pick it up with ease and even hold it up for a period of photo taking. The skin itself isn't paper thin, but when biting into the xiao long bao, you can enjoy the soft texture of the skin and behind it, you find a very savoury soup and chunk of meat embedded in the xiao long bao. 8. 7 Flavour TofuThis was a very interesting tofu. Everyone at the table tasted different flavours. The tofu itself was soft, almost like a steamed egg. With a light crisp tofu skin with sweet, salty and even spicy flavours from the seasoning on top of the tofu.9. Fried Vermicelli SeafoodThe vermicelli had tons of wok-hei which made this a favourite at the table. Yum Cha was extremely generous with the ingredients that it only took us moments to devour this entire plate of goodness. The noodles were stir fried in prawns, scallops, vegetables and fish slices.10. Almond Tart $3.20/3 pieces *highly recommended*Yum Cha's classic almond tart has a soft and flaky texture. In the center, you will find a smooth almond custard that is not too sweet and just right for it's size. It can served chilled and its sweet taste will be a hit with children!I'm a pastry buff and I know it when I eat excellent pastry. The pastry shell has the perfect level of crisp to it and every bite was perfect. My only regret was that I did not get any of these Almond Tarts to-go to share with my family. The almond fillings absolutely melt in your"

Made with their secret recipe, this homemade sauce gave a sourish sweet aftertaste. Paired together with their fish sauce, both made the whole plate of Yu sheng very tasty and appetizing. If you're a very 年年有""鱼"" person, you could add on more fish portions at only $12. HUAT ah!!Rating 5/5(2) Fried Crispy Chicken[$40+ whole]- Chicken was fried till golden brown color with slight crisp on the skin. I'm rather surprised that the meat texture was dry and tough even on the thigh part so I guessed the deep frying method dried out the meat. Marinades wasn't strong and flesh tastes rather bland, the only flavorful part was at the skin where the crispy garlic bits were scattered on top. You may want to dip the chicken in Yum cha's homemade sweet chillies sour plum sauce to bring more flavour to the meat. Rating 3/5(3) BBQ Suckling Pig[$220+ whole / $118+ half]- Crackling skin of this suckling pig made me gave up on my diet plans and went for more portions. Meat was flavourful with fats evenly distributed throughout the whole pig. It wasn't oily at all. Dip with a little of the smokey sweet sauce provided and it was heavenly! Although ""peng cai"" was more commonly seen on the tables during CNY than a ""suckling pig"" but for a change, I suggest you order this suckling pig instead. Skin so crispy its definitely worth all the calories. Rating 5/5(4) Braised Pig's Trotter with ""Fatt Choy"" [$38+ half leg]- Pork trotter was slow-braised till really soft and tender. Meat falls off from bone easily without me using any strength. Chinese spices was not strong and I suggest flavour can be heavier. Fatt choy (black moss) used did not help in the taste, only being a traditional auspicious ingredient as people always said ""fatt choy"" sounds like ""发财"" in mandarin. Dried oysters would be a better option to improve the overall taste of this dish.  My most love and also the best parts of this trotter were the jelly skin and tendons. They were so Q, packed with collagen and ""melt-in-the-mouth""!Rating 4/5(5) Fried Rice with Chinese Sausages in Lotus leaf [$38+ whole]- I'm quite disappointed with the inconsistency of this dish. Other than texture being dry, parts of the rice were undercooked. The other main, important ingredient ""chinese sausages"" were not much visible too because they were cut into micro cubes instead of slices which I felt the size was unnecessary. I totally could not taste their existence thus lack the aroma of preserved meat. Dried shrimps used were also very tiny although chef was generous to throw in a lot. Rating 1/5. Skip this."

The sauces were pretty heavy and overwhelmed the taste of the pasta for the most part - something I'm not used to. Still, thanks for the service with a smile even when my partner and I were the last to leave on a late weekday night :)"

The interiors are dimly (but aesthetically) lit, so you don't feel like you've come to such a busy place. The owner is good to talk to, they'd be happy to suggest you dishes in a no-nonsense way. Don't expect to be pampered here, really. The food is amazing. We had ravioli and risotto, both amazing. The third dish (ordered on the owner's recommendation) was something the likes of which I'd never had. It was basically two massive sausages on lentil (dry version of the indian Dal). Very interesting. Indeed. LIn short, the place offers you a great evening, is centrally located, and is much bigger on the inside than what the facade suggests. Not to forget, it's not overly costly."

Read from other reviews that the service is poor so we braced ourselves. When we arrived, we were seated and the restaurant was only running on 20% capacity for lunch. During ordering, staff was helpful to give advice on the food items. I was pleasantly surprised with one of the service staff who over to fasten a back cushion for me. That's awfully sweet of him to go to that extra mile for me. Grilled Eggplant - tender slices of eggplant grilled till soft and then served with melted cheese and tomato sauce over them. Perfect starters!Calamari - I think this dish fell short somewhat. The batter was soft by the time we ate them and though the serving size was quite generous, I found the calamari rather bland. If not for the tomato dip that accompanies the rings, it would totally tank. I won't order this again. Ravioli Con Carne - this is our best pasta dish of the meal! Little pillows of soft beef dressed in a strong tasting cheese sauce, something like blue cheese but not. Just really yummy lah!Before our Squid Ink pasta arrived, we were both offered bibs that they nicely secured on for us. I supposed if the black sauce splatter on you, it'll be quite a nightmare to remove. So thoughtful!!Squid Ink Seafood Pasta - quite a big plate of pasta that is a whole plate of Nero (that's Italian for black) goodness. Seafood is fresh and generous in amount. The squid ink sauce is very flavourful and every mouth of al dente pasta a party in the mouth!Spinach Ravioli - very good ravioli with tomato sauce. Not that this is not nice, it IS but this dish does pale in comparison to the other 2 pasta dishes. You can opt to have a half half of the Ravioli pastas on the same plate. This is what we did so we got to taste more without being too full!!Tiramisu - a nice generous square of cake. You can really taste the rum in it (nice!) and with the mascarpone cheese cream, a wonderful slab of heaven to finish up the meal. I dunno why so many complained about the poor service because we have enjoyed very good service, not just from one service staff but all round really. Will definitely be back to savour the rest of the menu!"

But unlike Pastamania, which is so intentionally terrible that just thinking about it risks sending me into a fit of rage, this was actually pretty good.The ribollita was just not following that recipe, it was much closer to a minestrone. The seafood stew was almost as good as the Cioppino at Cicheti, The eggplant starter was a highlight, although I am not sure if they use Italian mozzarella. The minced beef ravioli was good like everyone says. The chocolate lava cake was worth it."

It is located within walking distance from Tanjong Pagar Mrt so location wise was a good choice.Just a warning before you start ordering your meal, the pastas here are quite hearty and filling so maybe side orders would not be an added option. As silly as it sounds, i have never tried any risotto dish in Singapore before so i was keen to try it here. I ordered the Risotto Al Funghi Porcini, which is Arborio Rice cooked with Porcini Mushrooms, White Wine & Parmesan Cheese simply scrumptious. That changed my opinion of risottos as i thought it was a meal with bland rice and it was supposed to be dry.Overall i think i may visit this restaurant again for the variety of pastas that they offer."

I have a bad habit of ordering the same thing off the menu over and again - but only because it was really good the last time. I usually start off with prosciutto accompanied by slices of rock melon - not exactly the most challenging culinary feat but they always manage to get really sweet melons that pair nicely with the sharp salty taste of the meat slices. For mains, I am hooked on their squid ink pasta. Probably not the best choice if you are on a first date and hoping to impress. The last thing you need is to look like a giant squid self-imploded in your mouth. If that isn't an issue with you, tuck right in. The sauce is never over-powering and the squid slices are never rubbery - a fine balance that few achieve. The interior of the restaurant is warm and cosy with its dark wood paneling.

There were other choices such as Ninja Rice and Garden Greens. The orzo ( a form of short-cut pasta, shaped like a large grain of rice) was topped with a savoury gravy and quite tasty on its own. The onsen egg added a rich creamy layer to the orzo. The asparagus was soft and crunchy. The pickled cucumbers was tangy and crunchy, while the tuna was smooth and fresh.Fancy French (ala carte $16)Fig jam french toast drizzled in ume-boshi infused honey, fresh grapes, plums, homemade hazelnut butter.This dish had a 20 minute wait. It looked quite pretty. The fruits was fresh and juicy, the toast sliced easily although I wished that it could be crispier.Accompanied with Coconut Lemon Mint ($8)Fresh coconut juice, lemond wedges, mint leavesIt was basically fresh coconut juice, filling with thick coconut flesh.

Tuck into hearty, value-for-money meals at the newest concept to hit the hip dining enclave of Duxton Road - Ninja Bowl. You lucky CBD folks now get carb-free/low-carb Japanese-inspired superfood meals, as well as delicious all day brunch items. Each of the 8 bowl starts out carb-free but you have the options of healthy fillers. I'd go for the super high protein White Quinoa ($3); Ninja Rice (blend of blend of vinegared Japanese pearl rice and brown rice with furikake); Garden greens for $2. Fans of Japanese chashu will love the Buta ($14). I thought their slices of homemade cured aburi pork belly were better than many ramen places in Singapore. That velvety blend of meat and fats with a smoky char, sweet balsamic tomatoes, sour-sweet ume-pickled apples, roasted pumpkin seasoned with seaweed flakes and sesame seeds, were gelled nicely with  a runny onsen egg. So much love for this one!The Kabuki ($14) will make you love chicken again for the tender pieces of deboned chicken thigh are marinated in miso, soy sauce, garlic and honey. Sous-vide and then seared, expect juicy morsels accompanied by baby corn, homemade pickled beets, an onsen egg, snow peas, and a final sprinkling of fried shallots. The salmon poke ($16) pales in comparison after all that bursts of flavors in the other bowls. I couldn't quite taste the soy and ponzu sauce that the salmon chunks are supposedly marinated in. Each bowl comes with greens and a sprinkling of quinoa already, but I'd certainly recommend a carb base to help fill you up. Fish lovers could also tuck into bowls with pan-seared tuna tataki, or a saucey slice of unagi.While the bowls may be what give Ninja Bowl its name, what may bowl diners over is their All Day Brunch offerings. You will see the same ingredients being used, but now paired with creamy scrambled eggs and fragrant sourdough slices. I had the best rendition of braised beef cheek with eggs for only $17! Certainly I would never have this dish again at Common Man. You could also have the 24h braised beef in a bowl too. More Japanese inspired plates with unagi on toast ($19), and that umami miso cream Hokkaido scallops and mussels ($18). Make sure you soak up all that goodness with the bread. The latter works perfectly as a dinner starter. Love!Definitely have the Fancy French ($16), a homemade fig jam filled buttery brioche. Oh that light woody cinnamon scent, salty-sour umeboshi (pickled plum) infused honey, and the homemade hazelnut butter, created a great mix of flavors that will send anyone to breakfast heaven. It's so good that I finished half of it despite having this at the end of our meal! This pretty plate has a wait time of 20mins so order immediately. Sides, cakes, and caffeine (Smitten coffee) are available at Ninja Bowl too if you need something small (or more). There is also a weekday Tea Time Set ($10.90) available from 3pm onwards. Coffee, tea or me?Love love love Ninja Bowl! Definitely a go to for all my dietary needs. :))"

Sadly, both the food and the experience was lacking.We had the Noka (braised beef cheek), Buta (char shu) and the Yasai (salmon poke). Each bowl was about $16-18 (the price indicated on the menu does not include the base, you'll have to pay more for rice, salad, etc).First, the experience. The place doesn't take credit card, which is quite unacceptable given its location and the price of its offerings. Second, I wanted to change my order about 30 seconds after I paid (Wanted rice instead of orzo), and the cashier informed me that they could not do refunds. Seriously?Never mind, perhaps the food will live up to its expectations.The food came pretty quickly. However, the braised beef cheek had a weird aftertaste. The char shu was nothing special. The poke was ok, but the amount of poke given was tiny compared to other places with poke bowls around the Tanjong Pagar/Telok Ayer area (which also happen to charge less).The food would have been acceptable, but it was way too expensive for what it was. Coupled with bad customer experience, this place is just not worth the visit - especially with so many other good food options around the area (whether you want healthy food, salads, poke bowls, or rice bowls). Food is worth 2.5 stars, but the price and service brings it down to 1 star for me.Pros:- Free water is available- There's air-con in the placeCons:- Too expensive for the portion- Taste is so-so- Bad service experience- Much better alternatives around the area"

Make sure to ask for medium rare! They give an egg on the side for you to scramble and pour over the beef don. Definitely hit the spot with deliciousness.Comes with some side dishes: tofu, pickled veggies and beets.They have house made drinks like Sakura Cola and Wasabi Ginger Ale.Minus one star only for the numerous annoying little flies flying around.

Of course, you'll notice some familiar decor (Joey's white dog art, Ross' Unagi moment captured on photo) around too. They play FRIENDS re-runs constantly on the big screen and everytime the intro song plays, the staff will stop to clap to the beat. Right off the bat, you'll notice that the menu is full of catchphrases and puns from the long running TV show, like Janice's Oh My God baby ribs, Chandler's Thanksgiving Dinner, etc. It's cute and funny, but not worth the multiple dollar signs.

The food tasted good, it had flavour and the cheese on the pizza was very melt-y (I don't know if that's a word or not) but... it DiDnT WoW mE. They also show episodes from the show. There are some things that the cafe can improve on. The cafe should play music from the 90s than music now so there can be more of a retro vibe. They should also change the price of their foods and drinks. Some of the drinks are overpriced for what they actually are.

I had a chicken wrap which wasn't over-impressive in either size or contents but still filled the gap. The grilled chicken was perfectly cooked although, not a whole lot off it. There were some tomatoes, pickles and a garlic sauce that lingered on my breath for hours afterwards! Unfortunately there were no banana and chocolate crepes that day so we left without dessert, however the cabinet was well stocked with Mediterranean treats including baklava, Turkish delight, nougat etc. The menu seems perfect for sharing with an a multitude of cold and hot mezze items, pizza, salad, and more substantial meals.

Their noodles are sold at 4 prices $4.50 / 5.50 / 6.50 / 8.50. The bowl of Signature noodles was generously loaded with ingredients like Char Siew Slices, minced pork, braised mushrooms, wantons, pork lard as well as greens.I was swept away by how flavourful and by its piquant taste when I had the first mouthful. It has a unique fragrant that was not commonly found in normal hawker noodles on top of those pork lard bits. Texture of the noodle is springy too.There are a number of fried wantons as well as the normally boiled wantons. The fried ones were good with their thin and crispy skin.Char Siew was tender and great pairing with the noodle sauces.Not only was the food above average, the lady who serves the customers was friendly despite a busy queue ahead.

This ""hidden"" secret naturally add to the tastiness.I had the Dumplings version of the noodles. The dumpling probably didn't get to soak cooked long enough becos it like almost solid hardness for dumplings. The prawns embedded in these jello rocks is fresh and crunchy. The mushrooms in the sauce, and the sauce liberally soaking the noodles is probably the other secret. Now I remember that they don't clip off the stems of the mushrooms. Those stems are hard to chew, probably cause a few people to dislocate their dentures.The texture of the noodles is probably not as chewy as the other famous wanton noodle place, but when all the above combined the noodles dish itself taste wonderful.They lost one star for the dumpling, which I am pretty sure if they had less Q, this problem disappears.I won't return too much since I cannot remove those tasty pork lard crunchy crumbs."

Ordered up the large wonton noodles for $5 and overall it was very good. As others have said, the portions are large and the ingredients go beyond what other stalls offer.In the dish there were two types of wontons - fried (which were average) and boiled pork with prawns (which were amazing). There is also some Chinese cabbage and mushrooms which were a nice touch. The biggest downside was the noodles, seriously they need to improve the quality of these - just tasted wrong. Lastly, the sauce was a bit terrible, it wasn't a soup-style dredging of it which is good. Next time, go with the boiled wontons, extra vegetables and less of everything else."

The only issues I have are with the staff, who don't really seem to understand you, so patience is definitely required. One thing to note when dining, especially when you're going for the signature Crab Beehoon, is that the later you go, the higher the chances are that you'll end up with only the larger crabs left.

It is smooth and you can't taste the rice texture in their congee at all. I can see why some people love their congee for the smooth texture, but I personally find it is too smooth to be considered porridge - more like blended rice soup. Really generous portion, with great taste. They don't heat up individual serving of porridge when customers place their orders, which is a no-no for me too. Porridge ends up being lukewarm when served with a raw egg. In theory, porridge is supposed to be piping hot and the egg will be cooked instantaneously when added to the porridge."

Being a tourist we thought if all the locals line up mean either cheap & decent food or really good food. There were about 8 ppl in front of us, boy it took 45 min til we got our porridge!!! There's a ginormous pot (more like a huge tank w an automatic stirrer) cooking the porridge, then the 1 and only chef move each porridge portion into small pots and cook w the meat of choice (fish, chicken, century old egg or combination).It was worth the wait!!! We got the small $3 bowl to share w fish, chicken, and century old egg. Wow big portion for $3.. We promised to save stomach space to eat  food from other stalls but everyone spoon we ate had meat/ egg in it, that's how much content it had.

Maxwell is a stone's throw from my office so I frequent it often enough to be certain that this mystical porridge holds an amazing sway over the masses - the storefront is almost never without a snaking queue. Waiting time is anywhere between 30 - 45 mins, so bring along a book or play many rounds of scramble with friends to avoid ending up questioning your sanity. Patience has never been one my strongest suits so the wait made me a tad grouchier and enraged my expectation of the food to a few notches too high.Let's start with the best bit of the meal. The yu-sheng was spot-on - I can almost confidently say it is the best I have tasted in Singapore. Fresh fish slices are lightly marinated before being tossed with fragrant sesame seeds and crunchy spring onions. Patrons get to top it off by squeezing on some zesty lime juice. The hawker lady generously threw 6 limes into my box of $5 yu-sheng and I was a little perplexed by this plentitude but decided to go for 3 which turned out just perfect.   On to the porridge. The uniform consistency of the thick white gruel is certainly a feat. Every single rice grain has been subjected to prolonged methodical stirring that has ensured the gruel's acclaimed homogenity. And therein may also lie the reason as to why I am a staunch 4-star fan - being Teochew, my ideal porridge has got to have fluffy bits of rice grains still intact so this doesn't quite cut it for me.Despite my irrational porridge discrimination, I must say that stall is generous with the ingredients that go into each bowl. I ordered the century egg and sliced fish porridge and had a sliver of meat to go with every single spoonful - a rarity nowadays. All in all, try this if you aren't going to lose your temper over the wait. I am definitely more of a true blue Zhen Zhen Yu Sheng fan."

It serves the best yu sheng (aka raw fish) in Singapore, and unbelievably smooth congee. The yu sheng tastes good because there is no bone (there are so many out there which has small bones still stuck on the fish) and are sliced thinly. It tastes good with the sesame oil, black and white sesame seeds, and the garnish. For the porridge, even if you order the plain one, trust me it's smooth and tasty. It probably does not have the Crystal Jade plain porridge standard, but with the generous amount of sesame oil and sesame seeds, it's perfect to go along with the yu sheng.It gets sold out pretty early, and the wait can be pretty long. But I assure you that this is definitely worth the wait!"

It is smooth and you can't taste the rice texture in their congee at all. I can see why some people love their congee for the smooth texture, but I personally find it is too smooth to be considered porridge - more like blended rice soup. Really generous portion, with great taste. They don't heat up individual serving of porridge when customers place their orders, which is a no-no for me too. Porridge ends up being lukewarm when served with a raw egg. In theory, porridge is supposed to be piping hot and the egg will be cooked instantaneously when added to the porridge."

Maxwell is a stone's throw from my office so I frequent it often enough to be certain that this mystical porridge holds an amazing sway over the masses - the storefront is almost never without a snaking queue. Waiting time is anywhere between 30 - 45 mins, so bring along a book or play many rounds of scramble with friends to avoid ending up questioning your sanity. Patience has never been one my strongest suits so the wait made me a tad grouchier and enraged my expectation of the food to a few notches too high.Let's start with the best bit of the meal. The yu-sheng was spot-on - I can almost confidently say it is the best I have tasted in Singapore. Fresh fish slices are lightly marinated before being tossed with fragrant sesame seeds and crunchy spring onions. Patrons get to top it off by squeezing on some zesty lime juice. The hawker lady generously threw 6 limes into my box of $5 yu-sheng and I was a little perplexed by this plentitude but decided to go for 3 which turned out just perfect.   On to the porridge. The uniform consistency of the thick white gruel is certainly a feat. Every single rice grain has been subjected to prolonged methodical stirring that has ensured the gruel's acclaimed homogenity. And therein may also lie the reason as to why I am a staunch 4-star fan - being Teochew, my ideal porridge has got to have fluffy bits of rice grains still intact so this doesn't quite cut it for me.Despite my irrational porridge discrimination, I must say that stall is generous with the ingredients that go into each bowl. I ordered the century egg and sliced fish porridge and had a sliver of meat to go with every single spoonful - a rarity nowadays. All in all, try this if you aren't going to lose your temper over the wait. I am definitely more of a true blue Zhen Zhen Yu Sheng fan."

The yu sheng tastes good because there is no bone (there are so many out there which has small bones still stuck on the fish) and are sliced thinly. It tastes good with the sesame oil, black and white sesame seeds, and the garnish. For the porridge, even if you order the plain one, trust me it's smooth and tasty. It probably does not have the Crystal Jade plain porridge standard, but with the generous amount of sesame oil and sesame seeds, it's perfect to go along with the yu sheng.It gets sold out pretty early, and the wait can be pretty long. But I assure you that this is definitely worth the wait!"

The raw fish is dressed in vinegar, sesame oil and a multitude of other sauces topped off with fresh spring onions and chopped chilli.

While the quality was good, I think the squid could have used more time absorbing the flavors, instead of getting much of the flavor from the generous amount of sauce.Bottom line: I didn't think the food was all too compelling to want to return to, yet if you seek authentic Indonesian food, and particularly if you're with others eager to share multiple dishes, this will satisfy you."

Forget ambiance in the small, cramped and dirty downstairs dining area. It is cluttered cute, but nothing more. All I can say is that you really have to love Indonesian food to pay these kind of prices in this level of restaurant. Because there are dozens of classier, cleaner palaces with equally good or better (but not indonesian) food within a few blocks.

I had ro order another bowl of rice just for the sauce that was left over. I would have even lick the bowl if I wasn't at the restaurant. The satay was amazing and I could eat it all day, slightly different from street one. As it tasted like sweet char sui but with hint of spices. The meat was very juicy and so succulent. One skewer can shared for 2 people but I would say order one each as I didn't want to share because it was that good! Finally the beef rendang was amazing this was melt in your mouth tasty. The sauce was perfect with the right amout of spices and it doesn't  have a runny  sauce (the authentic way)! All in all I would give the food 5 stars, the reason for 4 stars was because it says it is open at 11:30am. We went there at 11:34am the staff says they are not open until 15 mins time.

I should've ask but I trusted her to give us (1) portion for each order. So she charged us $18 bucks for the rendang and it looked like a regular portion. Our bill was $64.35 for (3) dishes that was suppose to be light lunch for us. The overall flavor was just so so and the quality not too good. Oh....the rendang was tough and some parts inedible. Avoid this place! The ambiance also is not cool, small, old, and nothing good. I guess the worst part is that I was taken advantage of on my vacation.

Don't be deceived by the limited seating downstairs, the upstairs seating area is huge and true to style, they have several tok panjang (long tables) that can sit up to 20 or more. It is not halal though and even though it says ""Bali"" it is not Balinese food but more Nasi Padang style. In the day time they have assorted dishes displayed for you to choose from, nasi Padang style. So eating alone is no problem but night time, the solo diners will be more limited in choice. apart from the grilled squid, my favourites will definitely be the sate ayam (chicken satay) which is draped in delicious dark sauce and the portions are huge. One stick is enough for one person's main course. Another specialty is their Ikan bakar (grilled fish) which is more like a fish wrapped with otah. the portions are huge and meant for more than 2. haven't really tried anything unsatisfactory here before but the wait can be long at times especially when crowded."

I'm a huge fan of Korean food and they take it to a next level hear with the modern interpretation and use of carefully sourced ingredients. They have both lunch and dinner where the menu is a set menu. The dinner set comes as either a five course or seven course menu which includes a number of snacks to start the meal. Food: 4.5 starsService/environment: 4.75 starsOverall: 4.5 starsI went with the five course dinner set which also included 4 snacks with the meal. Everything was really delicious.  1) Sago cracker was topped with fish roe and small bits of octopus. The first snack and nice opener to the meal.2) Mushroom tart was really interesting. The tart had thinly sliced mushroom with coffee powder over a mushroom purée. Really tasty and something I never really had before.3) The beef tartare is a modern take on a classic Korean dish.  The tartare is mixed with a raw egg yolk, bulgogi marinade and brunoise of pear.  The tartare is topped with some sunflower seeds for some added crunch.  I'm not the biggest fan of tartare but really enjoyed this dish. 4) Chawanmushi is topped with sea urchin and had hints of black truffle mixed in. The texture is a less firm than your typical Japanese custard. This was really delicious and decadent. One of the dishes I will remember from my meal here.5) the first main was aged hamchi crudo. The fish is topped with sea grapes, daikon and served over a sake sauce and dashi jelly. Fish had a nice texture and I enjoyed the mixture of flavors.6) The grilled abalone dish is a modern interpretation of a abalone congee dish commonly served in Jeju island. The abalone is first slow cooked for four hours before being finished on the grill. The abalone had a real nice texture and a slight Smokey flavor. The abalone sits on top a bed of barley and garlic shoots.  I love garlic shoots and wish it was used more in cooking. 7) The quail dish is a bbq quail whose skin is stuffed with a quail sausage. I often find quail to be a bit gamey but that was not the case here. The chef's French technique is highlighted here in this take on a classic French dish. The sauce work again is spot on and the burdock jus is really luscious. 8) The Wagyu short rib is the main star of the evening and looking at the marbling of the beef I can see why. The short rib is cooked for 40 hours before being finished off on the grill. This meat is ridiculously tender and super delicious. The meat is topped off with a bone marrow jus and paired with a Korean style potato ragout. Really delicious!9) Last dish was the dessert which was really quite interesting. The dish consisted of cocoa nibs cooked with liquid nitrogen over a crumbled chocolate cake pieces and finely diced pear. The dessert is topped with candied shiitake mushrooms. Sounds odd but works and the shiitake really is from and center. Something I will really remember."

Colors used in the restaurant were simple yet soothing under the spotlights, allowing a classy feeling while dining.

Presentation was exquisite and this snack did really paint a good start for the upcoming dishes with its different kind of texture, crispy, soft and rubbery.Another surprise to me is this, the bite size Kaya toast with truffle butter topped with Parmesan cheese. The toast was such crispy that I had mistaken it for Macarons. Pairing it along with Beef tatare and raddish.

Sitting over the counter was real interesting as I manage to see him using the bigger pasta fork, coiling the pasta up in a tower form.

Overall, this dish was flavourable in its tasty stock!GuksuFor the additional, Since Chef Sun Kim was from Korea, we thought of ordering his national dish and had a try out. Pancake was tasty and not a bit being starchy. It was filled with calms. Pickled raddish was also provided.

I wasn't expecting that it was such an easy bite on a Quail than on a chicken. Together with the big piece of Portobello Mushroom, leek and raddish, it made a perfect combination.Jasmine Smoked Quail The slow cooked beef cheeks was served with potato gratin.  The sauce and ingredients used did marry well.

It complemented with the Doenjang (Bean Paste), Carrot and Parsnio.Rack of LambAnother View for Rack of LambThe last item on the menu and its really hard to bid farewell here. Pear was coated in silver with White Chocolate ice cream as pairing. What is unusual here is that you are able to taste some peppery taste in from the ice cream.Dessert - Silver PearlWhite Chocolate Ice Cream with PepperWe called for the bill after the last dish on the menu and was told that was not the end yet. What could it be we thought. It was a nitrogen surprised that came serving in a jar with pebbles. We were told to place the leaf side of the Rock on our tongue to get the full experience. The nitrogen steams then comes up of our mouth while we chew and talked. Wow!The RockI simply love the way how service were rendered throughout my dining even at the counter bar.

Chef Sun's newly minted restaurant on the edge of China Town received its first star this year, so we figured it would be easier to grab a lunch time reservation on such short notice. We lucked out. The food was stellar, the service attentive, and the vibe very hip. We were presented with three flavor-packed, immaculately executed amuse bouche. I don't even know what all the ingredients were in each bite because they were complexly constructed to amount to perfectly balanced bites in texture and flavor.  For my three courses I ordered the prawn salad, wagyu beef and the tropical dessert. I also ordered the oyster as a supplement. The prawns were perfectly cooked. The beef was rare and cooked evenly throughout, probably via sous vide. It had mushrooms and grilled asparagus. My husband who hates those vegetables liked them, so you know it must have been done well. The dessert was mango sorbet completely submerged in a mountain of coconut whipped cream and passion fruit sauce, with a bit of coconut crumble. The oyster was topped with lemon, ginger and gochujang and was surprisingly not spicy and in fact both savory and sweet. If you're looking for a classy, delicious, truly Michelin experience, look no further. Meta is it. At only $52 SGD pp, it is practically free in Michelin dollars."

The food is korean fusion done well, east meets west, the amuse bouche has always given a nice surprise. They used to have an excellent uni bimbimbap & korean seafood pancake when they first opened and i wish they would bring them back. The irish oyster with chojang (korean spicy vinegar) has been around since day 1 and is not to be missed.

The background of Chef Sun Kim gave an inkling to the cuisine direction- this good looker hails from a family of South Korean restaurateurs and is also the alumnus of Tetsuya Sydney and Waku Ghin Singapore. I reckoned it would be Asian inspired dishes and flavors with modern techniques and presentation but all that mattered when we embarked on the dinner was 'what's next'. At present, the restaurant offers a choice of three set dinner menus, namely five ($88) and eight-course ($128) Tasting Menus and a five-course Vegetarian Menu ($80). Here we have the eight-course Winter menu.The current appetizer is the Oyster with Pomelo, a plump Irish oyster seasoned with tangy lemon and ginger dressing, and finished with a sprinkle of pomelo flesh for bursts of sweetness. The Amaebi (Japanese sweet shrimp) dish was served with a dashi jelly, trout roe, slivers of pickled beetroot stems and carrot, as well as a smokey charred prawn head. The prawn head was the highlight of the dish though and everything else was what you'd expect of a sashimi dish. As much as the prawn head is super umami, i really do not recommend swallowing the whole thing unless you're ok with shards. Another highlight was the Wagyu Tartare with Egg Jelly and Korean Pear Kimchi. One bite and you know you're having an elegant deconstructed bulgogi bimbimbap with a more refreshing pear kimchi (Sun's homemade kimchi dressing) instead of the regular acidic and tart pickled vegetables. The egg jelly helped to gel the elements together and a topping of puffed rice added crunch to it.  Scallops are undoubtedly one of my favorite shellfish and these plump Hokkaido ones were paired with a slightly sweeter Korean miso, squid ink cracker and topped with compressed and shaved bottarga for more flavors of the sea. Someone give me more of the cauliflower purée please! Though the separate ingredients were executed well, I felt that on the whole they didn't really come together as a dish and thus it was forgettable. Our favorite dish was certainly the comforting John Dory/Sea Bass with Clams, Fregola and Basil which sees the pan-fried fillet of white fish (that crunchy skin side) presented atop a trio of clams in a clear clam broth (gosh that sweet brine) and finished with drops of basil oil. Slow Cooked Tasmanian Grass-Fed Beef Short Rib with Parsnip was given the Asian touch with pickled oyster mushrooms, charred spring onions and parsnip puree. The beef is cooked sous vide for over 30 hours at 62°C to break down the tendons and as such, it was kind of gelatinous. I prefer my meat with more grain actually and that is still possible with this technique. Flavor wise, it was on point. Vegetarians can look forward to Meta's dedicated vegetarian menu which features a take on the popular street snack, the Korean Pancake with Seasonal Vegetables, and (purple) Potato Gnocchi with Sweet Corn and Parsnip.For desserts, Pastry Chef Tammy Mah wowed us with her novel and innovative desserts. The classic cheese cake was given a twist with her Citrus Cheesecake with Blood Orange Bon Bon. A golden citrus gel encases the citrus cheese mousse and 2 dark chocolate hemisphere that held a blood orange liquid center. The creaminess melted away to reveal the light bitter crunch, which cracked to contrast the intense and fragrant blood orange jam. The White Chocolate Wasabi Cream with Sesame Sponge and Yoghurt sounded scarier than it tasted. You would hardly notice the wasabi if you didn't know it beforehand. It provided some  tingliness after each mouth, which was enhanced by the crackly pops. A fun 'petit four' was The Rock, a smoking espresso meringue made on the spot using nitrogen. Smokin hot.A list of cocktail concoctions are available at Meta but I wouldn't say it's their strong suit (that or I really dislike overly sweet drinks)."

I was in such shock that I sat there for a while to be certain of what I saw. There was a metal canister on the counter in which the chef had a few utensils he was using to prepare and plate food. He grabbed a spoon to mix a sauce and then used the same spoon to taste it, and put the spoon back into the same container. A few minutes later, he grabbed the spoon and did the same.I explained to the waiter what I saw. He said the container was filled with water as if that made it ok. The waiter then said it was very acceptable for a chef to taste food while preparing it, which I completely agreed with, but only if done with a clean spoon each time. I'm sure there are worse practices in restaurants that I have not witnessed as they are behind the scenes. But I would expect much better from a Michelin starred restaurant at this price point.

Highlander was one of the first (if not the first) third wave cafes to open in Singapore, and is still roasting and serving interesting blends of coffee on Kampong Bahru road.The espresso shot that I ordered came with a light brown crema, and the volume was spot on - a good single shot should not fill up an espresso mug. It had a interesting acidic taste - not tart, but the right amount of bitterness. The biscotti which come with all coffees in Highlander are sweet, and balance out the acidity.The house blend in Highlander is a combination of beans from Brazil, Ethiopia and Sumatra, which is a good combination for lattes, cappuccinos etc. The stronger, lasting aftertaste ensures that there is still a definite taste of coffee, and that the steamed milk does not mask any flavour. Highlander house blend uses a specific ratio of beans from these different countries to ensure a very specific taste. There is a retails space also, with coffee accessories available, such as grinders, filters, aeropresses and vacumn packs to store ground beans. Pricing is good - consistent with other cafes, beans are slightly cheaper. well worth visiting for well executed coffees and some very good shots."

Finally had the chance, a last minute decision to have lunch here as I was in the neighborhood. Called them up to ask for a table for two in 5 minutes and it wasn't a problem (this is a weekday lunch). Nice decor, in hipster Tiong Bahru... but warning bells sounded. The menu was awfully confusing, with unsophisticated font and layout. I decided on the 7 piece sushi set lunch which includes appetizer, sushi as main, and dessert. $48 isn't *nothing, so I am expecting something fairly decent. Appetizer was salad with some seaweed and mayonnaise based dressing. Ok. Just ok. The sushi platter was ... meh. I don't know if it's because I'm ageing, and having dined at very good sushi restaurants, I am very demanding? The shari (rice) of the sushi was crappy, the wasabi is 100% fake -- but ok, maybe Ikyu doesn't even purport to be giving the real stuff as it is fusion? Is it? The nigiri were not brick like, but made small to fit into the mouth in a bite, so that was authentic... but the ginger slices tasted pre made.. etc etc. Dessert was a scoop of matcha ice cream and we were asked if we wanted to top up $2.50 (or $3?) for cheesecake. We declined. The restaurant seemed to have seen much better days. It was half full... and I did watch the main chef prepare an aburi sushi platter with pricier fish on it. But it didn't look that good. I should have just stuck to sushi bar, for $10 less /person for much better fish, more filling food. And no pretense. I'm just relieved i didn't opt for the $88 tasting meal or the omakase. Also, clearly won't return. This was also a good lesson for myself to either go for inexpensive supermarket sushi, more affordable options like sushi bar, or all out splurge at $100 plus /person at the likes of Hashida."

I started typing this review in 2013, which I guess meant I missed out on an FTR, but oh well.I've never been here for dinner, but lunch is decent value. The chirashi bowl has so much raw fish and it's all of excellent quality that it's pretty reminiscent of Teppei. There're a variety of other sets for those not raw-fish inclined, and overall the fact that colleagues and I come here once every while for lunch means that it's not bad nor painfully overpriced. Prices *have* gone up a bit since they opened but I think the value proposition is still A-OK. It's hard for places like this to be exceptional in a day and age where Japanese restaurants are so common and so many offer similar prices with similar qualities. Once upon a time a find like this would have been four stars, but I think the Japanese cuisine bubble has burst, and nowadays? This is a three star joint. Solidly so, but I'm not sure about it being four stars. It's close though."

My friend, S, then suggested IKYU and we all agreed to try this place. I've walked pass this restaurant many times since I frequent Books Actually (book store) but haven't got a chance to try.  Since we're meeting up to celebrate my ""home coming"", what better place to re-start my restaurant hop in this tiny island filled with good food at IKYU. The three of us opted for their value for money set lunch. Priced from $28 onwards, i think it's a steal considering IKYU is a semi-fine dining (?) establishment in the hip Tiong Bahru neighbourhood. We ordered Yuzu tea to start (refreshing, $4 a glass) and a bowl of grilled truffle edamame. SImple and delicious.We also ordered 2 other appetizers of golden Anago (eel) sushi roll and as well as grilled mentaiko. The grilled mentaiko is a tad too salty just make sure you eat it together with the sliced cucumber that comes with it. The set lunch comes with a starter of apple salad and vegetable tempura. Both are tasting portions. As for mains, I ordered Bara Chirashi (rice topped with fresh raw salmon, white fish, tuna cut in cubes) while my 2 friends ordered grilled kampachi served with white rice. The grilled kampachi was fresh and lightly seasoned with salt. All set lunch comes with miso soup as well. Just like any set lunch, you get dessert and coffee/ tea to end the meal. We thought the dessert was the weakest and couldnt even figured out what was served - a citrusy pudding done bad topped with fresh cream and a tiny slice of strawberry and melon globe. In total, we paid $150-ish for 3 drinks, 2 starters and 3 set lunches. Service was ok and restaurant tend to get a bit noisy."

We started with a scallop carpaccio dusted with black truffles. It was *divine.* I savoured every bite, every lick. The second and main course was the miso-marinated black cod, served with a grilled rice ball and a selection of grilled vegetables. The texture of the fish was perfect; it melted in your mouth. The rice ball was crisp and chewy all at once, and the grilled veggies had flavour and texture -- even the lotus was yummy! The third course was a shrimp tempura somen -- utterly slurpable and delicate. Lastly, dessert. I had the mille-feuille while my partner had the cheesecake. We both oohed and ahhed as we took tiny bites so as to make the experience last longer!!Presentation of all the dishes was stunning -- the attention to detail was not lost on me, from the garnishes to the balanced colours on the plate, to the types of dinnerware used. The service was attentive and friendly, and perfectly timed. Our servers responded to our every need and never felt in the way. They re-filled our water glasses without hesitation and were smiling at each interaction. My only complaint is that we had to ask for water -- IMO this should be the first thing served upon giving the patron a menu. However, the service was impeccable in every other manner, so it is difficult to be too upset about this!The atmosphere is friendly, warm, and upwardly casual. The ambiance is elegant but not pretentious. Dark hues on the walls mix neatly with well-lit spaces and tables that feel private even though they are next to each other. One last small complaint -- their website includes a photo with several pretty-looking cocktails. They look delectable! Yet their beverages menu includes only two cocktails on the list. I'd love to see IKYU design a few more to match their marketing campaign and the unique flavours of their food menu... I can't wait to go back and try their a la carte menu!"

It's a high end Japanese dining joint opened by Executive Chef Takuma Seki, former chef-de Cuisine of Hide Yamamoto at Marina Bay Sands. And it is the only Japanese restaurant in the hippie coffee zone in Singapore- Yong Siak Street. The interior is a futuristic industrial jungle made with stunning pieces of brass, bronze and concrete. Definitely an atypical Japanese restaurant and i'm not quite sure how it relates to fine dining or the Zen that IKYU tries to achieve. It's not that i don't like the decor, it's just that i feel it works better for an izakaya bar instead.Food wise, the prices are on the high side as IKYU takes pride in using quality ingredients. The fish is flown in three times a week from Tsukiji and so, sashimi prices start from $15.50 for 5pcs of Salmon/Squid/Engawa to $68.50 for 5pcs of Blue Fin Otoro tuna. Sadly, the fish didn't come close to the Tsukiji sort that i've had. The lunch menu on the other hand is a lot more affordable ($25/35) and i'm glad i tried this before even considering their ala carte menu. 4 sets are available and each comes with appetizer, salad, soup and dessert. Pardon the bad quality pictures as it was a spontaneous lunch and the lighting is not the most ideal for food photography.The IKYU sushi set ($35), assorted sushi 6 pieces and roll, is the most pricy of the lot because of the expensive fish from Tsukiji. If you have eaten at Tsukiji before, these sushi are like half the size of what you get there. I was perhaps 50% filled after eating this and i don't consider myself to be the biggest eater around (just look at my size). I found the fish to be on the dry side as well.S had the IKYU Chirashi set ($25) which is the same Bara chirashi on the menu ($28 ala carte). Little cubes of sashimi?! You've got to be kidding me. The only other place that i see cubed sashimi is at Sushi Tei and they serve it on their salads. Honestly there are way better chirashi-dons around and i would direct you to my favorites- Chikuwatei and Tomo Izakaya. They give you fresh, chunky, sliced sashimi. Not diced ones.Perhaps the seven-course omakase menu ($128) would provide you with a better idea of the quality of the food served at IKYU, but honestly, i would rather take the money somewhere that can actually fill me up. IKYU is just average to me. I think i would be happier eating at Sushi Tei in fact. Maybe i'm biased; a hungry girl is an angry one. It makes me hungry just thinking about this one. :/Would IKYU work for the Tiong Bahru crowd? I can't speak for the others but IKYU is not convincing enough to draw me away from the River Valley/Clarke Quay area for Japanese"

Lunch sets range from 20s to 30s and I have to say, I really liked the experience. Every lunch set comes with an appetizer, soup, ice cream and coffee or tea. I had the bara chirashi set and ordered a side of engawa and hotate sushi on the side. The bara chirashi was really good, a little low on the rice but the fish was super fresh, plentiful and served with fresh wasabi and shiso pieces, which really enhanced the flavor of the rice. The chef was nice enough to serve my two hotate sushi one aburi, one raw with seasoning, and both were delish. The aburi piece had a bit of sea salt burnt on top and it really brought out the sweetness of the fresh hotate. The engawa was served with yuzu and excellent as well. The appetizer of the day was apple salad with takoyaki, and the takoyaki was freshly made with crisp slin and melting glorious content. Apple salad was good too. And the soup was a clam mushroom miso soup with egg and it was earthy with a great combination of sweet and savory. Loved it. Will definitely be back for more."

And they'll bring the food to your table. We were seated in a table and once I went to the counter to place the order, they moved my family over to a different table. I had to go back and change the order again to update the table number. Also they don't provide you napkins, so make sure you get your own or have a back up plan.Portions were very small and even though I placed 3 orders of the breakfast, they brought all the food in one plate. I had to then ask them to get us additional plates, bowls, utensils since 3 of us would be eating (what were they thinking?).Food was good, but there are many other places with much better service and much better food and portions.

You can see it in the food levels of Singapore's many malls around the city, or like we also did, visit the original location on China Street in between Telok Ayer and Chinatown. But Killiney's original location on Killiney Road a little walk's away from Somerset was just as quaint and much more delicious in my opinion.Their system of ordering is at the cashier once you've found a table. You can't order items unless you can provide a table number, so if you're with a buddy, have them take over a table while someone else puts the orders in. MAJOR KEY. We had their soft boiled eggs and kaya toast, mee cheong, mee siam, and iced tea/coffee. We ate like kings for about $20-$30 I believe. I don't remember the actual amount, but it should be around that price--pretty great for Singapore.My favorite was their kaya toast. SO much thicker and still crisp compared to Ya Kun's, and their spread was less sugary like Ya Kun does it. I even bought a jar of kaya spread to take home to the States! I loved it THAT much (kaya is essentially pandan, coconut milk, eggs, and sugar). I can't wait to use it on my toast at home. Their iced tea was SO good, not overly sweet like at Ya Kun, and definitely freshly made with fresh foam on top of my cup. We were so excited about our first order, that at the end I put in an order for mee siam after looking around their shop at the photos. That wasn't my favorite item, but the egg was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was a hint spicy with lots of flavor. Service is QUICK and their workers are all bosses at efficient food running and order taking. Hats off."

The toppings are pretty basic in comparison to most places but it gets the job done. It's just so good. Don't miss out on ordering it. They have a system for ordering. This is important. I travelled solo, so it was a little difficult to get it down. Step one, find a seat and mark your territory (put an umbrella down on the table). Step two, note your table number. Step three, go up to the front, place your order, you must give them your table number.  You'll see a menu on the wooden panel on the left side of the cashier, point to things if you need to (I did). Step four, wait for your food and enjoy."

It's hard not to eat 2 of these french loaves when they're SUCH a good value.  A french loaf, 2 eggs, and a kopi will be about half the price of any other sit-down breakfast in Singapore.  Sometimes the staff can be a bit rude - probably because they are an institution for kaya toast and the queue is pretty constant during the entire morning.  Most of the time I had pleasant experiences with the staff, and most of the time my table was clean when I sat down (again, this is about what you can expect with low-cost casual dining in Singapore).I should say this - this Killiney Kopitiam location is the original, and the best by far.  I have always had great quality food here, whereas other locations are VERY hit-and-miss (usually a miss).  I started going out of my way to come here, even though I was working within walking distance of the Raffles location.  Just don't think that the rating and quality of this place will be the same island-wide, or at the airport."

You know they have been there a long time, not the sort that people buy at furniture stores for the ""vintage look"". The curry chicken and mee rebus here are famous, and for good reason. The curry chicken is one of the best, if not the best I have tried in Singapore. It's super thick and aromatic and the chicken and potatoes are cooked just right. You can really taste the fresh spices and coconut that have gone into making that delicious gravy. It also has a real kick of spiciness, not like the lousy curries you get in food courts that are oily and one note. If i were to nitpick, I would say that sometimes the chicken has that faint chickeny taste you get when the chicken used isn't super fresh."

Their meats are soft and tender but with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside, and is skillfully cut by their waitressing staff from the bone into small manageable pieces. They also portion it out equally amongst those seated at the table, so no ugly squabbles over the last piece! If you're feeling a tad adventurous, you can try ordering a plate of their beef innards, which are various segments of cow intestines. These are slightly more pungent and chewy and takes some getting used to the taste, but is definitely one of the must try items on their specialty list! To end it off, they serve a sweetened persimmon drink to help cool down the body and soothe the throat after a heaty bbq - really great service with attention to detail."

The potato foam and the egg went deliciously well together, and was light on the palate, with the chorizo ketchup giving a nice homely aftertaste.- Esquina's Spanish omelette: confit onion, potato, crispy bread, olive oil caviar ($6) - this was alright, tasted more like lightly fried potato than anything.- Roasted cauliflower, cauliflower couscous, Serrano ham, manchego cheese ($16) - this was decent and flavorful; a tad too much oil though- Crispy baby squid, chili coriander, squid ink aioli ($14) - we ordered this at the spur of the moment, and it turned out to be one of our favorite dishes of the night. The squid was crispy and flavorful, and we loved the squid ink aioli. Perfect for munching over great conversation. Definitely get this to share.- Pigeon, forest berries escabeche, burnt Rosemary polenta, crisp shallots ($22) - this took forever to come, though the pigeon was juicy and tender. The berries were a nice touch. - Grilled Spanish octopus, Jerusalem artichoke, burnt onion, oyster leaf ($28) - the best dish of the night, in my books. The octopus was meaty and tender, loved the charred bits, and it went brilliantly with the artichoke puree. Highly recommend this.- Salted cod ""Alkorta"", iberico & tomato chickpeas, black garlic from ""Las Pedroneras"" ($28) - another brilliantly executed dish. The chickpeas and tender cod went fantastically with the sweetness of the black garlic, not to mention the visually stunning presentation. We were too full for dessert, but they did give us complimentary bites of chocolate ganache on bread.I liked that the chef made the effort to serve the dishes (we were seated at the bar) and introduce the dishes to us. However, the service was slightly off. The servers had a knack of interrupting us mid-conversation/mid-bite. Got slightly annoying after awhile. Overall enjoyable and worth a visit!"

The Singapore outpost of Jason Athertons restaurant empire is not at all up to the level that one should be able to expect. The dishes are some sort of mid-sized dishes categorized by Sea,  Land and Soil. Much of the food is of very good quality, especially the Spanish Breakfast and the mini pork burgers standout. The food is however not the main problem, it is more the service that is faltering. We were just seated when we were told it is last orders. Why even accept reservations if you are closing the kitchen right away? The service was also in general slow,  20 minutes wait for a beer when the place is virtually empty isn't ok. Staff were also mostly interested in talking on the phone or with each other. We also had them without asking opening bottles of water and charging 9.5++ SGD per bottle. Selection of beer is boring and over-priced but the wine selection is good and can recommend the Torello cava. The prices per glass are however cheaper than buying a bottle (they claim 5 glasses per bottle and the price for a bottle is 6.9 times the glass price -  waitress just stared at me and left when I pointed out it was cheaper to buy per glass. Probably not her fault but the management need to have better pricing strategy). This all sounds like the place is bad but the redeeming feature is the food so hope the management can produce some decent service as the prices should mean that one can expect both food and service to be good."

Maybe walk-ins at Esquina will be possible until the hype dies down?Since I wasn't able to check out the interior, this review will strictly be about the food. As the dishes are tapas portioned, our server recommended that we order about 7 dishes between the 2 of us. Luckily, I wasn't too hungry that evening, so we were able to get away with just 5 (which definitely put our wallet at ease in the end.)I ordered 2 snacks. The warm thyme and onion bread was more like a typical butter croissant to me. I couldn't taste any of the thyme and onion. I did like the smoked bone marrow butter it came with, though- it was served in the bone, which was cool, and it had a distinct taste (in a good way.) My second snack was the pork crackling, which I loved. The dish is comprised of 2 big pieces of pork crackling, decorated with salt cod and smoked herring roe. It was creative and I'd order it again.For my main, I chose the ""soil"" category (basically, veggie based dishes.) I really enjoyed my beet salad. The burrata they used was what won me over. Hell, it also won Miguel over, and he doesn't even like beets! The raspberry and pinenut crumble was a nice touch and went well with the rest of the flavours. However, the truffle honey was a bit of a miss for me; Migs said he could smell it but I felt that it was lost amongst everything else that was going on.Despite the creative dishes, some of the flavours just don't come through. Considering the prices, I expect more. But I get the trendiness of it all, and it's definitely a place to be seen. I wouldn't come here if I were super hungry, but for drinks with friends or a light dinner, I'd be cool with it.--*Well, we did end up with a tiny table outside, which isn't ideal, but a table is a table!

It really came together well.tinyurl.com/bxpp6gkPork Cheeks - This was, to me, the weakest dish.  I know.  It is pork.  How can I say that about pork.  I just thought it was a touch dry.  The flavour was great.  The texture just didn't seem quite right.(no photo)Curry with lobster - This was a beautiful dish.  The curry was nice. At some level though, I thought the curry overpowered the sweetness of the lobster.  I think the dish could just as easily been made with a nice prawn.  Lobster is a delicate sweet taste.  it is easily lost.tinyurl.com/bea95ouThis meal was compliments of my manager.  However, I do want to note that I think this is a dining experience worthy of the associated price. Overall - This stands within the five best meals i've enjoyed in Singapore.  The food is the star of the show.  But certainly the energetic ambiance provides a strong supporting role.  The service was also very good.  Esquina is the type of dining experience I look forward to sharing with others.(lol - i do not usually mention other reviews.  however, according to one of the other reviews, i must be pretentious if i like esquina.  i just want to say if that is the cost for enjoying this wonderful dining experience, so be it.  i will be as pretentious as it takes.)"

Well three is a wrong number as we ended up ordering more and waiting and waiting because we didn't order at a go. How inefficient.We had the seaweed dashi poached oyster, which was okay, tasted like a boiled oyster with some dashi, nothing really special. I am not pleased to announce we were not impressed with the pork crackling as it tasted like pork flavored fried fish maw with some black roe on top. None of the lardy goodness we were expecting. We mostly got plates from the Sea section, the scallop sashimi with duck ham, lemon, and burnt cucumber was okay. Scallop sashimi has a delicate flavor and I felt the accompaniments overwhelmed it. Good accompaniments should accentuate the flavor instead. I did like that they left the scallops whole instead of slicing them thin or into pieces.Next up was the seared scallops with duck green curry and coconut rice. I don't eat peanuts so we got them on the side so that's good. The scallops were really good and seared properly but again the green curry didn't complement the scallops!We were hungry so we got the snapper, which was done quite well and came with pine nuts and couscous, with some orange. This went quite well as a dish and I rather enjoyed it. Last up for savories was the beef short ribs with cauliflower, tongue, and brown butter. This was a disappointment because we waited the longest for this and it tasted very ordinary. Well it just wasn't a party in my mouth. Meh. We ended the meal with desserts and had the chocolate mousse with popcorn milk and the manchego cheese pudding. We thought the popcorn milk sounded good on paper but it overwhelmed the mousse and textures wise, mousse and milk don't quite go well together.The cheese pudding was a welcome surprise as it was salty and sweet with the apricot jam that came with it. I liked it.Would I come here again? Probably not. This place is pricey, has soso service, and flavor combinations don't pair very well. I would go out on a limb and say this - the chef in charge of the menu is ballsy but doesn't have an amazing flavor palette. By tasting the food I think their cooking skills are up there, with excellent technique, but the menu is just a disappointment. There is innovative cuisine, and there is food mixed up on a platter. Every bite is a surprise, but not necessarily a good surprise."

But it somehow works, and it's constantly busy with customers returning for food which more than makes up for the slight discomforts. They have a few additional tables outdoors, but the ambience is definitely different from the flurry of activity taking place inside. We arrived after 7 on a Monday, and the indoor seats were already taken up. Nevertheless, the food was awesome, and we loved the clean, fresh flavours of the scallop cerviche. The Iberico Pork and Foie Gras Burger is delicious as well, but the foie gras flavours and textures weren't really present. The desserts - oh, the desserts - embody exciting flavours, and it was really difficult to make that final decision. A great place for tapas, that's for sure.

But I love the space, love the energy, love the service, love the food!!Our server told us that it was an exceptionally crowded for a Thu. We started by sitting outdoors getting our drinks while waiting for a table. The wait was 1.5 hours by the time we got a seat inside. While outdoors, we started with some crispy baby squids with our sangrias. The sangria is yummy! And the crispy squid lightly battered and served with squid ink aioli. Do not expect our local version of crispy squid, Esquina does it with the squid still soft and juicy inside, while only the exterior is crispy. Dishes:- sea urchin and crab bisque. Like what Mark D. said, absolutely wonderful. The sweetness of the urchin is perfect and it is served with clunky crab meat. It is also served beautifully plated on a stone bowl.- ham croquetas. Filled with chunky iberico jamon, wonderfully salty and balanced with the potato filling. - marinated beet salad. It is too difficult to get good beets in Singapore. I never liked beet until I moved to NYC, and eating beets there totally changed my mind about this muddy veggie. The version here is still not like the beets we get in NYC, but the execution of the dish is faultless. It is served with burrata cheese and honeycomb. The honeycomb gave an amazing finish to the entire dish that it gave me pure joy....- beef tatare with frozen foie gras and confit egg yolk. This is served in small portions served with toast. We were not sure on what to expect when we read frozen foie gras. But when it was served, I knew it was exactly like the shaven foie gras pâté dish that I had in David Chang's momofuku ko restaurant where he served it up like a bowl of savory ice-cream. Totally yummy, and I only wish they are more generous with the shavings here. Complex flavors, beautifully executed.- seafood paella. Do not expect the traditional Spanish paella. This doesn't come with the soccarat (crispy bottom bits). It is closer to a rendition of risotto without the cheese, so it is much lighter and you can really taste the seafood bisque that they use to cook the rice. The seafood is served on the side and you get snapper, shrimp and crispy squid. I didn't feel that I need the seafood at all, quite happy with just the paella.Overall, really enjoyed the dinner. The tiny space reminds me so much of the little restaurants that peppered the village in Manhattan. It was a blessing in disguise that Burnt Ends was full till 9.30pm, which is why we ended up here. I was not impressed with Jason atherton's other restaurants in Sg, this one now totally changed my mind. Now....if only the wait is shorter!"

Not a place for large groups because you can hardly converse farther than your immediate left/right. Ham Croquetas ($10) is my must order. 4.5cm tall balls filled with creamy bechamel and chunks of what is possibly iberico ham (i expect no less) left us wanting for more. The ham was a little salty but i love it.The Smoked Haddock, spring onion and Manchego omelette ($18) was the fluffiest eggs i've tried in a while. I would liken it to a souffle but firmer. The taste was light; simply flavored with the natural sweetness of the smoked haddock. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.Do order the Sauteed gambas, chili garlic, potato dumplings and bisque sauce ($24) even though it doesn't look spectacular. The prawns were fresh and bouncy and i love the rich bisque sauce so much i could inhale it. Gnocchi were meh.And oh.. the Beef Tartare.. simply divine...

There were both hits and misses with the food but one gripe is that the size really can be afforded to be more generous even though they are tapas. Otherwise, it might be better to charge tapas price for tapas rather than main course prices for tapas.Foodwise, it was acceptable to me to experiment with the new creations but not for The Folks who commented that they had no idea what they were eating that night.

Esquina doesn't take reservations, and I realise upon getting a seat that I might as well have eaten standing because they were really awkward and uncomfortable.Food : Wow, the heritage tomatoes with sherry dressing were something else. Fresh, juicy and sweet ... one of the best tomatoes we have had in a while, including the momotaro ones we usually have in Japanese restaurants. Good ham croquetas and we really loved the gambas as well as the scallop ceviche. The slow cooked egg was quite good and the ox cheek was quite soft and tender. The Iberico pork and foie gras burger was the winner of the night for my two friends however, they couldn't stop raving about it. We also really liked the sangria ice cream cone ... I think it was a daily special though.Ambience : Like the trend that seems to be going around for tapas bars, it also has an industrial chic vibe. But unlike Foodbar Dada, the seats are uncomfortable and almost make us feel they are discouraging diners from getting too comfortable.Service : Quite decent.

This place has serious cooking credentials.  Culinary Director Jason Atherton, notably Gordon Ramsey's protege, Michelin star winner and the first British Chef to complete a stage at the famed el Bulli restaurant in Spain, has teamed up with Irish Executive Chef, Andrew Walsh to create a stunning modern tapas restaurant. Esquina is reminiscent of tapas bars you would find in Spain.  A long, thin hallway with a bar, high stools and an open kitchen provides a chilled, relaxed atmosphere.  It's all about the food here, and you get the feeling you're in for a treat the moment you step through the door.The menu is innovative and exciting and there are also blackboard specials.  This is not your average chorizo and meatball menu, this is a whole other level of tapas entirely. Mr M, who requested to be referred to as 'The Stuntman' in this post (ok, I'll indulge him) and I dine on a Tuesday evening, and it's packed with a cool vibe.  The staff are friendly and we take our stools at the bar with the perfect view of the kitchen.  Executive Chef Andrew Walsh is on-board this evening and he helps us with our menu selections. The Stuntman and I choose our menu as follows:* Iberico Bellota* Tuna Tartare, wasabi celeriac remoulade, vietnamese dressing, crispy shallot (blackboard special)* Marinated beetroot salad, honeycomb burrata, pinenut crumble* Grilled Rib-eye, spice aubegine puree, lentil pearl barley dhal* Baked bone marrow with snails, parsley and horseradish pesto* Berry sorbet (compliments of the chef)* Watermelon salad, gazpacho, basil sorbet The food is exceptional and beautifully presented, with the standouts for me being the beetroot salad and the bone marrow (no easy feat given I wouldn't usually order bone marrow, or snails, for that matter)! This is an underground foodie den and well worth adding to your dining itinerary when you're next travelling through Singapore.  Imagine your street cred when you whip out this gem.  I have to say, Singapore has some amazing dining experiences - it's a foodie's paradise, take note!"

Full English breakfast was both a clever play on words and on the palate.  Desserts!! Strawberry gazpacho with basil sorbert was a fantastic way to finish.

After looking through the reviews and pictures, I was really excited about the food because they looked beautiful in the posted pictures. Unfortunately, Esquina didn't deliver for me. The plating was beautiful, the service was good, and the decor of the place was chic and pretty. The most important thing though, the taste and flavor of the food, did not do it for me. We ordered all the popular dishes I've read about in the reviews. The pork cracking was just....fried pork skin. The pairing of the herring roe and salt cod mousse did not really push the taste of the pork to greater heights. Instead, it was just in general a flat dish. I have the same criticism for most of their dishes. The ingredients are good, but they just do not come together to deliver a dish of finesse or overlapping flavors. The jambon croquetas were good for what they were, fried cheese balls with ham, but even that was a tad too salty. The whipped burrata with beets was visually an astounding dish to look at, but again the essence of each element did not shine through. The burrata lacked the distinct milky taste, the pinenut crumble did not even taste strongly of pinenuts. So apart from the welcoming acidity the pickled beets brought, the dish was again flat, with no complexity. The uni bisque actually did have a good taste, and chock full of crabmeat that could have been sweeter, but the crab flavor overwhelmed the delicate uni flavor, and as a result, after the initial taste, the uni taste was barely detectable. Arguably the best dish of the night though. The pulled pork and foie gras burgers had good flavors going on, albeit a little too salty. I do appreciate that they blended the foie gras in the pulled pork patty. The sauerkraut was a little redundant though. In general, I thought that the items were overpriced for the taste level and the amount of food served."

After waiting at our table outside the restaurant for approximately 30 minutes, we decided to check on our orders with the waitress/hostess who took them. When we asked the said waitress about our orders, she simply turned to the kitchen, without acknowledging our query, and asked the crew if our food was on the way. Crew informs her that it was not. The waitress turns back to us and curtly informs us that our food ""is not coming"". No apology was given nor an explanation proffered. Her dismissive attitude was completely shocking. It was as if we had spoilt her evening and put her in a bad mood, and not the other way around. I should point out that we did not even complain about the wait, but merely queried her on whether our food was coming. I don't care how good your food is if you treat your customers like crap.

It's small, it's popular and overcrowded, but if you actually do get a seat by going strategically at 6pm, the rewards are sweet. Watching the finesse of two chefs working/performing in front of you, agile, swift and serious, I can hardly discount any dish as so-so. The effort is worth half the battle. But have you tasted the gorgeous  heritage tomatoes or the slow cooked eggs? I'm not saying that you will NEVER taste any better, for what I have to pay for them, I'd say dish them out every dinner! It's definitely worth my money, the consistent doneness of the egg with the patatas brava spin off is awesome. If the leg of ham doesn't instill any faith in how serious they are, I don't know what will."

Upbeat alt music, friendly servers, wall-sized murals and cool bar seating. Small enough to be special, but lively enough to be energizing.Wine list is more unique than most places in Singapore, but it still kills me to see the prices (ex: $150 SGD for a €28 bottle). Served at correct temp, which is also appreciated. I know, it's a cocktail place, but the group was into wine :)We tried a host of the food, and it was all pretty good! Not great, but good. Best dish in my opinion was the eggplant. Creamy and salty and umami flavour. Sashimi was too salty with too much of the sauce, which was disappointing; the rest was good.Overall, a fun experience in the heart of the ""cool kids"" neighborhood and worth a visit."

The duck liver mousse and crispy brussels sprouts are always a favorite. The past 3 times I have dined at Neon Pigeon, the friendly staff has frequented the restaurant with a generous *cough cough free* pour of house Sake (that is after each member of your party carefully selects his or her own traditional serving sake cup to take their healthy shot with.

They told us they had some credit card payment issues and everyone had to pay by cash, which made us panic a fair bit, but they resolved it quickly. Given this place is quite pricey, I think they really ought to have a backup plan PRONTO if their machine fails again.We got a bunch of things to share; chicken liver (not bad), hamachi carpaccio (YUM), bone marrow (not bad), brussels sprouts with bacon (not bad), octopus (surprisingly tender), risotto (soso) and my favorite, the duck breast on mash, which oddly tasted of Maccas' curry sauce; delicious nonetheless.

Terrible, arrogant staff. Which is a shame because the food was actually quite good - I'll get to the good after the ugly. Singaporean restaurants aren't known for good service staff but this place takes it to a new level. One particular smarmy little eye-rolling git got my blood boiling. 1 - As this place has small and large plates, we asked if he was sure one dish he brought us was the large version, as it was pretty tiny. This was the first *eye roll* ""Trust me"" of the night. 2 - Waitress (different staff) tried to take a plate away when there was clearly food still on it. When we protested she said ""ok ok I was just asking"" 3 - Checked the bill at the end of the night and they charged us for a dish they never brought. When we told The Eye-roller, he basically called us liars by saying ""No I'm sure I brought that, it was the one with ""the sauce"" on it"". Yeah great description genius! Trust me I'd know if I ate Brussell sprouts!! Eye-roller eventually relented and took it off the bill. 4 - Asked them to split the bill onto two cards, two-thirds on one card, one-third on another card. I know this is not convenient, but they refused saying they can only split it 50-50.  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?? If you can split it 50-50 you can split it 60:40 can't you?? Instead The Eye-roller stood there making some lame excuse about the system being down blah blah. Ok after all that, we actually enjoyed the *cough* overpriced *cough* food. The highlights were the ribs, the duck breast (surprisingly went well with katsu curry sauce), and the duck bao. Korean chicken was also good. Don't bother with the Bag O' Potatoes. Seriously it's even worse than your aunt's bad potato salad at an Aussie BBQ that no one touches. Not even the flies."

Perfect for a date or a sophisticated girls'/boys' night out.Only downside: you'll be paying (gentrified) Keong Saik Road prices, making it more of a special occasion destination than an every Friday sort of joint, at least in my price bracket.

The rib is definitely some really nice ribs and is full of flavor and fall off the bone even though it's pale and seems like it wouldn't be very flavorful. The soup is the kind that warms your belly, probably has some ginger or something in it to make you feel all warm and tingly inside. Probably great when you're sick, it'll keep you warm long after you leave the hotel AC and go out into the blistering heat.... One thing though! They do charge if you use the handwipes on the table.

They serve Bak Kut Teh (duh) in the style that I prefer. The soup is peppery and one could definitely taste that the broth came from hours of boiling pork bones. On top of that, they do have unlimited broth refills, so don't be sad if you're running out of the delicious soup, they would refill it for free. On top of that, there are other side dishes, which are common offerings in most BKT stall. The side dishes are all fine but I think the dough fritters deserves a special mention. Their dough fritters are crispy without being oily, which complements the soup very well. Another thing that one may want to note, they serve 2 kinds of tea. One is the common teabags and the other one is the traditional chinese tea (complete with all the chinese tea set, you know the one with the small cups)."

And indeed when I first tasted it, I had that magical moment...  Lao Ban beancurd, unlike the usual traditional ones, is served cold and has a pudding like texture. I know there is this Lao Ban style beancurd recipe that is being spread online, but it doesn't seem like anyone has achieved the golden balance as yet. It is definitely not easy to achieve the pudding texture, and then when you start eating it, all the soya milk start oozing out. Okay, I am not too good at describing it, but you get the point. The bottom line is: it's delicious! After trying it, I finally understand why the queue is so long. There are two flavors that you can choose from, original and almond. Usually I will just go for the original. Even my overseas friends enjoyed this a lot when they came over here. However, I do feel that they can make a little improvement by introducing a not-so-sweet recipe as the regular ones taste a tad too sweet to some."

It wasn't quite what I expected having seen an entirely different concoction while living in Taiwan with the same name, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say it redeemed (mostly) plain tofu. Sweet without being sickly so, a snack that one can consume without guilt unless one starts building a pile of empty plastic containers.Of course, between here and Tian Tian, one can end up waiting for a long time at Maxwell Food Centre - but if one is Singapore, I figure it's just part of the cultural experience to participate in one of the national sports.

Instead of splitting into smaller pieces, it melts away into a beancurd liquid in your mouth. Really interesting! To the point where we all got addicted to this new variety and no longer prefer the old beancurd!

Hai San has been serving the same quality of roast chicken rice since the 1970s. In fact they used to serve these wonderful caramelized spicy roasted chicken wings, ""hiam sit"", which sadly are no longer available on their menu. Hai San was doing business at the Henderson market till about two years ago when the market was renovated and they had to move to their current location, Tiong Bahru Wet Market and Food Center.  You walk up the escalators at the front entrance and walk straight exactly 126 paces and arrive at Hai San Hainanese Chicken Rice.Chicken rice is widely associated with the boiled version as shown on numerous food and travel shows, to the unfortunate exclusion of the roasted variety.  Ok, it's still room temperature chicken served over aromatic rice boiled in chicken stock and fat, but it's a dish that lends itself poorly to language and description.  Also, I'm just too lazy to try to find the right words and phraseology to adequately convey the true genius of this apparently simple dish.  Truly, it's hard, very hard work wordsmithing the experience that is roast chicken rice...that and I'd rather just hang out at Bar Bar.  You just have to go experience it for yourself.  What's the point of drawing breath if not for a series of sensory experiences.I recommend having the Char Siew or roast pork loin if it looks good to you.  The char siew will be of the tender variety; no chewy char siew here.  Definitely ask for a chicken liver  (they run out of these VERY early!).I've included a picture of the chili, because as an erstwhile schoolmate pointed out, ""It is all about the chili"".  While I think that may be overstating the case somewhat, she's not far off the mark.  It is 97.4% about the chili.  Hai San's is hot, so go gently into that red night.  There is a strong hit of garlic and then some cool lime-y notes.  It's about this time that you need another hit...because, oh baby, it burns so good!"

And they have been in business for a long time. Bullfrog porridge may sound exotic, but I guess there are people who like it, enough to sustain 5 such restaurants. The #1 item on the menu is, as you can guess, bullfrog. I'm not much of a frog person, but connoisseurs will tell you that only the freshest frogs are delicious. Anything less than alive seconds before it was cooked is going to smell. Frog is actually a very delicate and tender kind of meat. Your two options are ginger scallion bullfrog, and kungpao bullfrog (the spicy option), and an increasing number of frogs. Your first frog will cost $8, but going forward, you start getting free frogs thrown in. For our party of 4, we had the buy 4 get 3 free deal at $30, which comes with a claypot of rice porridge. We had 4 frogs done kungpao style, and 3 with ginger scallion. Everyone prefers the spicy version, but it does get a little overwhelming so get the non-spicy version for the in between bites.They also serve other dishes at the restaurant, like stirfried baby kailan (I liked it), eggs and bittermelon (good. really liked the eggs), fried pork intestines (very crispy) and marmite chicken (we had it without marmite). There are other items on the menu that we didn't try, but based on what we did get, the food at this restaurant is solid. While rice is an option, everyone seemed to be eating porridge. Their porridge is done plain, Cantonese style, which is smooth and thick, topped with scallions and white pepper. It is the perfect texture to go with the food, and especially the generous amounts of sauce that came with the frog dish. We ordered an extra pot of porridge.The restaurant was full on a Friday night, and the clients range from families with little children to group of adults in their 20's and up (definitely missing the teenage market). They have crazy long hours, opening from 12pm to 5am. There is another famous porridge place next door, so don't get confused when you find yourself at the location. This is the one that sells frog."

We had the sushi omakase, for about $110 per person.The Public Izakaya is a mid-priced place, but Sushi Ishii isn't. we had 11 pieces of sushi for the omakase. Flown directly from Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo, and well-seasoned with wasabe by the chef (just enough, not too much, not too little). We sampled:TunaFlounderSnapperAmberjackYellowtailIsaki/GruntBaby amberjackScallopOctopusSalmon roeTuna Aburi.I was bewildered that the chef started with tuna, because I am of the understanding you start with the lightest tasting fish and progress on to heavy dishes. 11 pieces of sushi for 110$++ is a bit pricey in my opinion. We had two pieces of wagyu beef each, on the house, in the middle of our omakase dinner. We were then served a miso soup made from a very dark miso after the 11 pieces. Would I come back again? Maybe for the cheaper grub in The Public Izakaya, but not the Sushi Ishii section.."

One could easily missed this place as it is pretty secluded, located within a lush stress-free surrounding. I must be blind all these while, even though I walked along Craig Road too many times, but never had I look to the left where this awesome food court is.  Here's a step by step guide how to get there. If you're coming from Tanjung Pagar MRT, walk towards Tanjung Pagar road and cross over to Craig Road. Once on Craig Road, take the first left turn into Yan Kit Road and walk approximately 50 meters in. The food court is on your right and you can easily spot the beautiful glass-like structure. Tables and chairs are aplenty and if the weather's fine and breezy, opt for  al-fresco dining. It's beautiful and you'll be surrounded by lush green trees. Otherwise, indoor seating works  with adequate air-cons and fans blasting altogether. Another plus point, the ventilation and air suction system in the kitchen works really well as I didn't smell any oily smell from the main dining area. Nobody wants to be coated with ""Eau De Foodcourt"" after lunch time, if you know what I mean. Now, the food. Amazing array of young hawkerpreneurs occupied the lot here waiting to impress the crowd. From Garcon (french cuisine) which is under the same management as Immanuel French Kitchen at Salut Coffeeshop, Block 119, Bukit Merah Lane I, to Two Wings, La Stralla (Italian), El Jeffe and Wild Wild Catch among others. I was spoilt for choice and finally settled for Pork Belly Burger from El Jeffe. Delicious! Two thick slabs of pork belly (with crackling, mind you) sat on top a perfectly grilled bun topped with onion compote and rocket with special dressing. Side of criss-cut fries. All for $11.90. With such superstar line-up, I can't wait to come back some other day and try the others. From the beverage corner, I spy a whole list of craft beer on display. That alone already warrants a return trip. Any takers? Let's plan."

We were lulled into a false sense of security by the nice ambiance and the availability of some craft beers. Maybe we ate from the wrong stalls, or maybe not. But we were so unsatisfied that once we got home, we whipped up some comfort snacks to make good.This food court has 7 stalls:Italian: The tagliatelle bolognese has to be the worst pasta dish I've ever eaten in my life. Even my toddler who loves guzzling plain, uncooked pasta rejected it. Should have tried the pizzas instead (I saw more pizzas on other tables than pastas).Drinks: They've some beers on tap, and some bottled craft beers. Pints start at $8 but water starts at $5. The craft beer selection isn't as great as the facade suggests, given that we've reached peak craft beer and literally even hawker centre beer shops stock craft beers. I was a little put off by the high price of water - this ain't some uppity restaurant, its a damn food court.Seafood: We ordered two dishes, the mussels and the grilled salmon. The former was rather bland and flavourless, with a soup that felt like nothing more than water and MSG; the latter was a steak cut with bones.Two Wings: The wings were very nicely presented. They were also well-fried and juicy - they must have brined the wings. Unfortunately I think they were over brined. My entire family found them too salty and couldn't eat more than 1 wing each.French: did not tryGrilled meats: did not tryThai: did not tryWe spent $25 per person."

THE GOOD:  The Food, the clean, civilized indoor food court environment, the decor, the lighting, the location, the staffTHE BAD: In my opinion, they don't market Essen very well.  There is no website that lists the stalls or features the menus of each stall.  The Essen FB page only advertises it as a food court and outside of the beverage promotions posts, they're not saying very much.  They should be posting features on each stall and photos of their gourmet quality dishes.  I'm not sure what they are hiding.No Serviettes!  At these prices, they should be giving customers a real napkin and not tissues (on request)  Minus 1 star for not rising up above regular food court practices! THE VERDICT:  For a high-end indoor food court, this place has a lot going for it.  Even with higher prices than a normal food court, the quality of the gourmet food is a good value.  Matched with a civilized air conditioned atmosphere, it's definitely worth a visit."

Not just that, they serve it two ways - in soup or stir fried.The soup bee tai bak had a thicker soup than I expected, and was closer to the consistency of sauce than normal Chinese soup (which is the consistency of clear Western soups). It was tasty with an interesting flavour, with notes of salted fish, which is rare for soups. Meanwhile the fried bee tai bak was tasty too and had a generous portion.Other dishes were good too.Perhaps the most interesting and unusual dish was salted egg bittergourd. Now, I hate bittergourd, but at this place this dish was almost not bitter. It was also coated with a thin and crispy layer of salted egg, making it crispy on the outside yet soft and tender on the inside - a perfect contrast. Plus the salted egg was delicate, unlike many places where it is too heavy handed.The Western Butter Chicken was alright. It was decently fried, though it could've been crispier. The butter sauce was what one would expect.Four Heavenly Kings was a grandly named vegetable fish with string beans, brinjal, okra (lady's finger) and petai (bitter bean). It was fried with a very strong fire, and was quite spicy (and quite smelly due to the petai too). Your mileage may vary - I didn't like most of the vegetables involved, but have to concede that if one did (and liked spicy food) one would enjoy this dish a lot.Black bean sauce hor fun was very tasty and fried with a strong fire, giving it good wok hey (smoky wok flavour), with a decent portion of beef inside. The garlic fried belly pork had an especially generous portion, and was tender and crispy.The fragrant lala were indeed quite fragrant, though spicy.Lastly the seafood tofu came in a huge portion, but it tasted quite pedestrian.All of these dishes came up to only $89, and despite going there in a party of 4 we left stuffed while still bringing a lot of leftovers home."

So one star for this!Nonetheless I couldn't help to up my rating to 4 stars because everything else is amazing!They have different special menu for each day and you should definitely go for these:Hu Tieu Nam Vang (every Monday):This comes in its simplest and purest form, is a soup, normally made with pork bones, and served with a type of noodle that is very different from the one for pho or other common vietnamese noodle dish. The broth is light but extremely flavorful and very comforting although the ingredients are so simple. The ingredients are soft rice noodles, topped with some pork ribs and a shrimp, all sprinkled with a touch of pepper, and some chopped green onions and cilantro. Banh Canh Cua a.k.a Mee Tai Mak in Crab Soup with real crab in it (every Thursday):I'm not Vietnamese but obsessed with Vietnamese noodle soups, to the point that my friends call me ""soup head"". The perfect noodle soup has a complicated broth that enlivens your tastebuds by sight and smell, has noodles that can only be described as silky (al dented has no place in Vietnamese noodle soups), is generous and filling and takes well to all condiments to suit all discerning palettes (whether you prefer salty, sweet, sour, hot or a combination - personally I love salty).The Banh Canh Cua at this establishment is absolutely Vietnam in a bowl, but not familiar like pho. It is a bold noodle soup - the strong and pungent smell of crab from the thick gravy-like broth tells you so. The noodles are thick and slippery tapioca noodles with aslightly chewy resistance. The dish served here is topped with crab, some slices of pork and not much herbs, simple yet satisfying, I adored this Banh Canh Cua so much that I could have had a second bowl just for the soup. An incredibly enjoyable noodle soup dish.Oh, they have great fried chicken wings coated with sweetened fish sauce and spicy garlic snails, that are available daily. What a perfect place for supper or post party eats!"

But thanks to Yelp, I've learned that there are some legit Thai and Viet eateries on the upper levels. My husband and I wanted to try Jane Thai but it was closed, so the trusty Yelp app pointed me to Thien Long.From the looks of it, I immediately felt that this was the closest thing to Viet street food I would get in Singapore. Everything checked out: Plastic furniture? Check. Eating in the hallway? Check. Aunties bickering loudly with each other? Check. No prices on the menu but overhearing the bill amounts for nearby tables and knowing that it's only about $8-10 per person? Check.Let's start with the grilled pork chop with vermicelli. I LOVED this dish. Heaps of noodles, perfectly flavoured grilled pork, pickled carrots, peanuts and scallions + the sauce they pour all over it?  YAAAAAAS.The summer rolls were stuffed with more vermicelli, what I'm assuming is Thai basil, prawn, and pork. Once dipped in the sauce, these were also very satisfying. I loved how refreshing it was.Miguel's prawn and pork rib noodle soup was also on point. I thought the broth was not too salty and that (again) the flavours just worked. It's hard to explain, but we just felt the food had soul. You see it when you interact with the servers, as even though some of them speak little English, they smile anyway and want you to have a good time. I liked this place a lot, so much that I will overlook the roach that crawled on our table (since we were sitting near the hallway, I'm convinced that it came from the bathroom and not the kitchen.) I also want to stress that Miguel and I didn't get sick, either. Like I said in my tip, eating here is an experience! I hope I have more opportunities in the future to stop by."

It might not look like much with the plastic chairs and tables that date back to the 1970's, but this is probably the best pho (beef noodles) available in Orchard road and at a reasonable price. NamNam might have the long queues and exciting set lunch menu, but this place serves the best pho at a much more attractive price. The beef isn't as thinly-sliced and ""just-cooked"" as can be, but the broth is incredibly tasty (and refillable) and the noodles are cooked to just the right amount of bounciness. The bean sprouts are also given pretty generously, though you can always ask them to hold those if you don't like them. The pho is a special dish that's only available on Mondays but the regular menu is quite tasty too, with standouts being the Vietnamese pork chop rice. The staff is extremely friendly and refers to everyone as ""brother"" or ""sister"", and can be counted on to take orders (and custom orders) accurately. The food is also served pretty quickly."

I think she wants me to be the Duke or something. :-) In any event, I finally I found a fantastic Vietnamese food joint in Singapore. However, please put your desires for a posh/fancy establishment behind you when coming this eating joint. This amazing food establishment is behind some really shall we say ""interesting"" businesses. I ordered the Prawn and Pork Rib noodle soup, while my wife ordered the Grilled pork chop with vermicelli and Vietnamese Summer Rolls. The Prawn and Pork noodle soup was everything you would expect from a fantastic Vietnamese dish: refreshing, flavorful, and colourful. They used Sotanghon Noodles / cellophane noodles doused with a tasty broth topped with scallions. Very different from the prawn and pork rib noodles that you often see in Singapore.  Please note that this dish is only available on Mondays. The Grill Pork Chop with vermicelli was also fantastic. I think the key ingredient were the nuts that gave its unique crunchiness plus the fish sauce, which the attendant suggested I pour over the dish. The Summer Rolls were refreshing as is expected of a really good Vietnamese restaurant. I can't describe it, but you can tell that there is a lot of love put into the food. The patrons who eat there are true Singapore foodies looking for a great meal at an affordable price. Overall, I give Thien Long four stars. The only reason that it is not a five is the place is soo seedy. I guess that's why the food is so good. :D"

After a HUGE ""It's so Gooooood"" by the Boss Lady, Michelle, I just had to give this place a try. Walking distance from my office, it's hard to believe that Orchard's infamous 4 levels of sin houses anything else but.... Well... Sin. Well here's another sin to add to the list. Sinfully good food!!! Tucked away in a corner lies Thien Long Vietnamese Eateries, which I have to admit, was very very good! I'm ready reviews about their beef noodles that's only available on Mondays but unfortunately, I was there one Tuesday. Decided to give their prawn noodle (soup) and black pepper duck noodles (dry) a try and i was completely blown away! When the dry noodles first came, mountain tortoise here didn't realize that I had to add my own seasoning, so I had initially thought it was disappointing, but mix in the fish sauce and that sweet sour lime mixture (I'm assuming it's lime) and the dish takes on a whole different dimension. For those who love the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, this is THE dish to have. Light, fresh, delicate and fragrant, this wonderful bowl of noodles tasted like a deconstructed spring roll, elevated further by the salty, peppery flavours of the duck. In a culinary sense, this dish had everything! It's fuses together the soft chewiness of the noodles, with the crunch of raw vegetables, mixed with the sweetness and saltiness of its sauces, elevated with the saltiness and spiciness of the black pepper. It's like a firework of flavours going off in your mouth. The prawn noodles on the other hand, was what a Pho should be. Al Dante noodles, served in a light yet flavourful bowl of soup, heightened by the scent of fresh herbs. Don't expect giant prawns though while having this dish. Served with a couple of sliced prawns and soft bone pork ribs (I lllooovveeee soft bone), the star of the dish is definitely  the soup! What can I say... I have been humbled and Until I actually visit Vietnam to eat the real deal... This has to be, by far, one of the nicest Vietnamese noodles in Singapore! Added bonus that the owners are such nice, hospitable folks that don't pressure you."

I was surprised to find a quality sushi and japanese restaurant. My friends who lived around the area raved that it was the  best fresh japanese sushi place and recommended that it was ""cheap"" for the quality we were getting.I couldn't wait to look through the menu. There were 3 different menus, one for sashimi, one for sushi and one for cooked food. Very soon our table was covered with menus as we had a big group of about 2 families and friends. We were offered a private room with japanese style seating arrangement. It was cosy but a bit narrow. I'm quite clumsy so it was a chore to get up and go elsewhere. There wasn't any buttons to call for service. So I had to slide the door open and yell for service.1. Sashimi Mori 148RM++ for 3 paxSashimi MoriThe combination of the Sashimi Mori was the best! All the fish was fresh and practically melted in my mouth. You wouldn't have to chew any of the sushi. It was so flavourful by it's own. At this point, I did agree with my friend that the quality of the fish here was indeed fresh and value at this price point.2. Salmon Belly Sashimi 55.80RM++ for 2 servingsThe colour of the ikura and salmon belly says it all, ""extremely fresh"". The ikura was bursting with juicy goodness. The salmon belly here was so smooth, it melted in my mouth almost immediately once I ate it. for 55.80RM++, this is totally worth it.3. Shisamo 15.80RM++The staff offered us 2 types of shisamo, one was fried and one was grilled. Both tasted the same to me but neither of them was crispy, slightly disappointing.4. Hotate Nigiri 75.60RM++ for 4 servingsThe scallops were fragrant and again, melted in my mouth. It was so fleshy and definitely couldn't get enough of this.5. Tempura Mori 37.80RM++ for 2 servingsThe tempura serving portion was pretty small and pretty much all the tempura pieces disappeared with a blink of an eye. The batter was light, airy and crispy.6. Chawanmushi Ikura 13.90RM++Definitely getting this again, on my next visit. The ikura was extremely fresh and the chawanmushi was soft, silky and almost pudding-like. The flavour of the chawanmushi was extremely good. It wasn't too salty, but yet you could taste the essence of the chicken, prawn and mushroom into the chawanmushi. They definitely got the steaming timing down to perfection.Overall : A great place to have sushi in a comfortable dining area. Just note, when the staff try to push you to buy something that is ""rare"", don't go for it. They got us to buy some extremely expensive shellfished sashimi that we had no idea what it was, except that the staff claimed it was the last one.. Don't waste your time. Just go for the Sashimi Mori and Salmon Belly"

For those wanting more privacy, I remember seeing a room available for dining. If not, you could easily choose the booths lining the side of the restaurants. I found that they afforded some privacy without seeming closed off.If you don't mind waiting for a nice place to chat and eat, you can check out this place."

I've been eating here since I was around 6 years old, back when it was on the bottom floor of Sembawang Shopping Centre. It doesn't exactly serve Thai dishes like its name suggests, but it has delicious food regardless. The staff is super friendly, and always seems to remember my family(although that's probably because my father sticks out like a sore thumb with his bright blonde hair and blue eyes). I highly recommend the honey chicken, fried fish, cuttlefish, baby kailan in oyster sauce, and claypot tofu. The green sauce that they give with the cuttlefish is spectacular. We've been trying to get them to give up the recipe for years but no luck.I live in America now so I obviously don't get to go anymore, but I still get intense cravings for this gem of a restaurant."

We found that the service here was rather terse, the waitresses seemed to be rather unfriendly. We quickly sat down and ordered our food.The food came rather quickly, which was nice.Our first dish was the deep fried cuttlefish, which I really liked very much. The cuttlefish was very crispy and quite tender, not like the rubbery kind that I have had too often.We also ordered the pineapple rice, which was somewhat too dry. The texture was alright but I felt that the ingredients were somewhat lacking. Tastewise, it's above average.Of course, we couldn't miss the pad thai here which I feel is one of the better dishes. The pad thai was definitely up to the standard of the better restaurants with a good amount of ingredients and just tastes great.We also ordered a few other dishes such as the steamed cod fish, which I found to be fresh and tender.Overall, I think this is a great place to have some really decent thai food at a reasonable price, but try to come early as the place tends to get packed."

It was dressed in the Japanese Chef costume and looks gloomy sitting there.Interior bears a homely and welcoming feel with a ""U"" Shape Teppanyaki counter on the right and a few tables on the left. If you want to skip  sitting at the Teppanyaki counter, you can choose the sides table for a cozy place to dine. Unfortunately the space is rather limited and these 3 sides table were partitioned by a top hanging Japanese blinds only.Like most Japanese places, I thought beverages were pretty ordinary and have nothing much to talk about. They have this cold Houjicha infused with Wildberry, it tasted sweet and refreshing.Ajiya's Iced Wildberry Houjicha - $4.50Drink is made with fresh lemons and with soda, refreshing too.Lemonade - $3.50Starting off with the appetisers, it was quite mind blowing for someone who likes century egg. Served chilled with silken tofu and Japanese surimi crabmeat topped with bright orange tobiko was presentable. I like it best with them on the century egg sauce, addictive and delectable. That really whet my appetite for more!Century Egg Kani Tofu - $7It feels outcast not to order when everyone's is ordering. Fill your carbohydrates now! Sliced Potatoes were served on a hotplate topped with mozzarella cheese & mentai sauce generously.Potato Cheese Mentai - $10You can make it spicy or the non-spicy. The cold ramen dish was served beautifully with ham, egg strips, surimi crabmeat and vegetables covered. Together dressed in its tangy Japanese sauce, its just another item not to be missed in its menu.Hiyashi Chuka - $11What's Okonomiyaki? The word might not be familar but I believe that once you see it, you will definitely recall that you have seen it somewhere.  Aijiya is serving Okonomiyaki, a Japanese style Pizza filled with cabbage, tempura crisps, pickled ginger, scallions and egg. The best part of the dining session is that you can to topped it off with Okonomiyaki sayce, mayonnaise, aonori and bonito flakes, all at your desired servings!For Okonomiyaki you can choose to have seafoood, meat, veggie delight, choosing 3 items from the mentioned category. We had the Ajiya's combo which can choose 3 items from any category and we had Squid, ham and spinach. You can add on other toppings as well.Ingredients were served in a bowl and if you request you can DIY (Do It Yourself) by mixing them then pass back to the server to cook it well over the Teppanyaki counter. The best that it was cooked freshly in front of our eyes, carefully placing the food in the proper round shape. Food was not too greasy and ingredients were indeed very generous.Ajiya Combo - $15As a whole, service is friendly and the concept of DIY-ing is pretty interesting. Do note that no reservations will be taken for seats at the Teppanyaki counter. Also, GST is absorbed for all prices but do take note that 10% of service charge will be required."

Inside it looks like an establishment that has been around for years, but in fact it's only been around since September last year. As the name suggests, it specializes in okonomiyaki, and you get to choose between seafood, seafood + meat, meat, and vegetarian options. Each option lets you choose a combination of various relevant ingredients. The menu also has a bunch of various appetizers and sides but we wanted to focus on the core offering for our first visit. Within minutes of ordering our bowls arrived and we had the option of mixing and cooking everything ourselves, or letting the staff do it. For the full experience you really should do it yourselves. It's not exactly performing brain surgery. Staff are all very attentive and helpful and will keep an eye on progress for you. We picked two (one per person) to try various ingredients, and they were delicious. The ingredients were able to shine due to the barely-there egg/batter mix, which was just enough to bind everything together. Sauces, toppings (bonito + seaweed) etc were provided for you to apply as you please and to your taste. In a country where I almost never return to any restaurant twice (there's just too much choice), I would definitely come back here. Damage was $30 for two people."

The car park is free but it is limited to 20 or so cars, most cars back in and block each other, hence the restaurant staff would run in and out calling out car number plates to kindly ask the customers to move their cars.1. Batin Fish 40It was my family's first time trying this dish, it has a very smooth texture that almost melts in your mouth, the black sauce itself wasn't too heavy in salt or msg, so I didn't really feel thirsty which was nice.2. Fried Vegetables $15Apparently the vegetables served here are grown just behind Orchid Live Seafood. Hurray for using local and fresh produce.But I'll be honest, the vegetable leaves did have some black marks on them. No holes at least! The vegetables tasted alright, nothing to wow about. Just enough to make you feel good about your diet.3. Steven's Chicken $24Named after the chef Steven, this is basically fried chicken, fried so hard core that the bone is brittle when you bite on it! The crispiness of the chicken skin is addictive and we wiped out this dish in seconds! I needed another serving of this!4. Lobster Porridge $100/KGThis is what we came here for! Lobster tasted alright, although I know these aren't fresh lobsters, in comparison to what I had in Boston, it's still ""fresh"" enough to satisfy my cravings. The meat comes right off the shell! The porridge was also so flavourful and good, that I lost count of the number of bowls of porridge I had!Overall : Decent chinese family dining location, $40/pax.HUGE TIP! Definitely sit outside, do not fear the mosquitoes for the indoor dining area, with the air-con is so deceptive as the air con are so weak! You would think that since Orchid Live Seafood is filled to the brim everyday, they would at least be able to repair the air con or at least get more powerful ones. There's like 6 window AC units in that small area of about 7 tables and it's useless! Which is why everyone just orders the $1 per stick of Potong red bean ice cream after their meal!"

Despite being extremely far from home, we would drive all the way there for their bowls of lobster porridge, Steven chicken and friendly service. I am not a seafood person, and I definitely do not like lobsters. That said, I adore the broth of this porridge. The lobster has been cooked inside for so long that the porridge tastes like rice cooked in a rich soup, like the chinese version of lobster bisque. The porridge is cooked in a more Teochew-style as well, retaining the grains instead of cooking it till it's fully mushy like congee. I usually have the porridge on its own, giving someone else my lobster because it really is quite a treat on its own. The steven chicken is also worth trying, a crispy, sweet and savoury dish that goes well with the porridge.The location of this place is slightly difficult to find and it is a little expensive at about $50+ for two people with only the lobster porridge, but you get what you pay for."

We ordered the lobster porridge, which was surprisingly tasty and the congee was of the right consistency. The broth was tasty because we could taste the sweetness from the lobster. This is definitely one of the must eat dishes over here; everything about this porridge is almost perfect.We also had the chili crab with mantou, which was just alright to be honest. We've had better ones in seafood restaurants elsewhere. We also ordered the Stevens chicken (the chef specialty), which was nice as well.Overall, I have to say that the price for this place is rather expensive; we paid close to $150 for 3 persons. However, the quality of the food makes the high cost rather worthwhile."

I tried their winter special (cheese, turkey bacon, chicken ham, cheesy sausage, pineapple and mayonnaise with cinnamon) and meat supreme (cheese, ground beef, shredded chicken, beef pepperoni, chicken ham and turkey bacon).  They weren't overdone - the pizza crust was baked just right and the pizzas tasted pretty good. I got an additional mini platter of chicken nuggets, calamari rings, samosas and spring rolls. The total bill only came up to $30 for so many things.There's no room for people to dine-in, so the pizzas are all for take-away. Rite Pizza also does free delivery with a minimum purchase of just $20.

It was good but still not great.  Another thing I noticed was the lack of hygene in the handling of the soy sauce dishes.  The guy stuck his thumb right on the top surface of where people pour their soy sauce.  Some people may not care or pay attention to details like this but this germaphobe won't be returning here.  They set ""The Sushi Bar"" way too low to be enjoyed by this foodie."

I loved the rolls, but three aburi-ed rolls which sort of taste the same after a while, for 2 people, are a bit much, and hence we struggled to finish the rolls, which resulted in a fair bit of waste. We also got the normal chirashi, a portion of salmon sashimi, a pitan tofu. The chirashi was topped with thickly sliced fish of various varieties, and the rice was sufficiently vinegared. Yum!My favorite was the pitan tofu. Tofu is actually a misnomer as they use egg custard as the tofu, and then top it with century eggs, flying fish roe, spring onions, and shredded surimi. I really liked this.Prices here are very reasonable for what they are. I guess this is the Singapore version of hole-in-the-wall sushi, tucked in a corner of Orchard Road.

The word ""Sushi"" was an immediately 'Yes' when she suggested having our dinner there, no regrets at all. Hidden on the 4th floor of Far East Plaza, a mall that needs some upgrading to compete with its rivals. My first impression of the place is this must be a low cost type Japanese restaurant as its interior and menu matches to my impression but the cost of the food is at a different level! I ordered the Normal Chirashi Set (A bowl of rice with a mixture of assorted meat) that cost $24 to try out since I was told how good the food is. When my meal was served, my eyes ""popped"" out when I saw the portion of the meat, it's probably the most generous portion I come across in Singapore so far. My first bite of it has made me craved for more. While engaging a conversation with my friend, I can't help but to enjoy every bite of it; multi-tasking at the same time. (Eating 70% and listening 30%) It was that enjoyable. I had the Chawamushi (Steamed egg) and that's pretty decent, so for the $30+ I paid for the meal, it's certainly worth the enjoyment.

The aburi salmon sushi is fabulous. You can taste the smokiness of the seared salmon and it is not too overpowering. The sushi has a good balance of fish and rice. The presentation is good. The premium chirashi is equally satisfying. Lots of fresh seafood and too little rice though the amount is just right to fill you up. The premium chirashi has seasonal items (uni, prawn and maybe others which are not included in the regular chirashi) and so is the price. Mine was $38.90 which I felt was reasonable given the 3 pieces of uni and sheer quantity of fish. I loved the aburi salmon and salmon belly in it. It is crowded during lunch time, so you will need to wait to get a table. They lost our reservation though, so we took the counter seats until a table was free. For a small place, there are 6 people in the tiny kitchen slicing and dicing and cleaning. It is a decent, no frills sushi bar focusing on fresh and good food. I will go back again.Oh, you can also request for fresh wasabi which is $4 extra. It is definitely better than the usual wasabi which is made from powder/paste."

The Chirashi comes with an eclectic assortment of fish including: salmon, aburi salmon (my personal fav), tuna, yellowtail, swordfish, scallop, fish roe and tomago. The fish portions are thick, so you won't feel short changed after finishing the dish. My only complaint, if any, was the small layer of rice underneath the sashimi. I'm a huge sushi rice eater, so this could be a personal complaint.

Quality-wise, I thought that it was on par with more expensive places like Sushi Tei or Itacho sushi.Everyone orders the aburi salmon rolls- and with good reason. These were fantastic! The salmon was perfectly-seared and came in thick slices, and the mentaiko mayo on the top of the rolls complemented the rest of the ingredients well. For both dishes, the fish:rice ratio was 2:1, which was impressive considering that it's usually the reverse in similarly-priced places.Wasabi was better than the usual but lacked the clears-your-nose-immediately spiciness of the freshest kinds.

Business is good so it is advisable to make a reservation. One of the speciality is the soft shell crab with salmon roll. The salmon is torched so this dish is suitable for diners who are not into raw food. The ingredients go well together. The unagi avocado roll was a rip off in my opinion. I understand that unagi is not cheap but not a lot of it was given and 5 pieces of sushi at $17.90 before tax were not worth it. The other sushi rolls had more portions and value for money. Only cash or nets is accepted.

We ordered the spicy tuna maki, soft shell crab and due to the yelp tips, the salmon alburi roll. The spicy tuna maki is a very simple roll, but absolutely delicious. It was probably my favorite roll out of the three. The soft shell crab roll was wonderful as well. It was also presented beautifully. The salmon alburi was probably my least favorite of the three.

I came here for dinner, ordering the famous salmon aburi sushi, wagyu skewers, salmon kabuto miso pot and the scallop carpaccio. The ambience is definitely mediocre but the taste of the food is able to make up for it. The prices are pretty reasonable unless you move up the scale and go for premium stuff, that can set you back about $75-$100 per person. Otherwise you can get away with about $50 per person. They don't stinge on the portions and the food is worth the wait after you have ordered. The crowd here tends to be young, 20s to 30s and somehow you don't really see a matured crowd."

There is always a long line when I go, and then I'm very thankful for having made a reservation. Lesson learnt from the first time we tried to walk in.. This gem is hidden in an obscure part of Far East Plaza - I can never remember how to get there and end up wandering around the 3rd floor. But just follow your nose :p Or else, come up the escalators which are nearer to Goodwood Park (as opposed to the escalators nearer to Grand Hyatt) and I think it should be on that side..Aburi salmon roll ($14.50)! Aburi scallop roll ($16.90)! Scallop mentaiyaki ($13.90!) All the flame grilled goodness you could ask for :) And mayo. Although thankfully there isn't an overabundance of it, I think Koh Grill and Sushi goes heavier on the mayo.Chirashi ($24.90) is usually a gd deal too! Comes with a fair amount of fish and seafood. 3 Kind sashimi ($14.90) pretty gd deal too, fish slices are fairly large.Oh, top up your own tea/water service.

It looked limited, but it was more than enough to fill up the appetites for the 3 of us. Surprisingly on a Sunday lunch time, the place was pretty empty. It could because it was raining heavily outside with the place not sheltered to the nearest bus stop or MRT station. Besides us, there was only 2 other occupied tables.

The meat was juicy, with hints of the shrimp paste without too salty.Jiu Hu Eng Chye 鱿鱼蕹菜Blanched cuttlefish with water spinach and shrimp pasteOne like that young water spinach ( also commonly known as kang kong) was used in this dish which made it easy to chew.

It is a lovely place in the old black and white bungalow along Scotts Road. When it gets crowded, it can be a bit noisy, but when only one or two tables are occupied, it is so quiet you can hear your voice echoing (if you are very loud). The usual dishes are given a makeover by using premium ingredients. Wagyu for beef rendang. Otah with Hokkaido scallop. Cod for ikan masak merah. Even the dessert is a bit modern and fusion with gold jam. The food is cooked perfectly well, the spices complement each dish with no jarring effect. If you love Indonesian food, this is the place to be. The higher prices reflect the ingredients used. The portion is not huge and will probably be good for sharing (2-3 persons). It will be perfect if they have a one-person portion like Violet Oon's Kitchen. There is valet parking so that helps as the place is not very big. The entrance is a bit tricky if you drive as it almost faces the T-Junction of Scotts Road and Cairnhill Road. Otherwise, it is within walking distance from Newton MRT station and the bus stop is right outside."

In fact, I have always thought that it was some private housing since the facade looked like its kind of from the Bristish Colonial times.Another thing that made me think that it was more of residence was that there was usually one or two cars in the compound and I always thought that if it was something commercial, there should be more vehicles in there.Till we went into the compound and understand that parking lots were really limited and valet service is available.INDOCAFE is situated on a raised ground and you have to climb up a few steps through the stair of red carpet. Be welcome by the Peranakan flooring at its alfresco dining and rich culture before you entered into the restaurant.I was enlightened by the cafes lamp hanging down from the ceiling and its pot of flowers as we entered into the restaurant. There then the waiter ushered us to our table.Place was modernly furnished yet still retaining some peranakan culture with its wooden furnitures as well as decorations.At any time if you feel that you need to spice up more on the food, just dig the small spoon into the peranakan style pot for more chilli,The dishes were all served at a go and not according to any sequence as stated in the menu. However, the waiter that served us did mention every dish's name as he placed our sharing portion on the table.""Bok Nee"" when translated from Teochew means black fungus. The salad was served cold and rather spicy to me. Salad consisted of Wild ""Wood Ear"" black fungus with Sambal dressing. Red onions as well as chilli padi can be seen among the cold salad, it really gave our tongue a very good heaty kick for a start.Talking about Peranakan food, Kueh Pie Tee is always my top favourite as snack among the cuisine. Ingredients are served separately from tThe Crispy pastry cups. Get your hands dirty by making your own Kueh Pie Tee now.Ingredients like shredded turnips, prawns, mushroom and even fresh crab meats was given. In fact, I would say that they are more than sufficient for the 4 cups. How generous! Before serving the kueh Pie Tee, do remember adding the garlic chilli on your cup, it does really make a big difference!Don't miss out another staple by the Peranakan's. This homemade 5 spiced pork meat was rolled and wrapped in soy bean curd skin then deep fried. Sweet sauce and sesame seeds were added when served. Color was dark brown which was close to a burnt color, however be rest assured that the meat was moist and overall the bite was crispy bite at exterior and was soft in its fillings.The fattier it is, the more authentic it becomes. Forget about the lean pork you have outside for Babi Pongteh, try this and enjoy the absolute softness from the braised pork belly in fragrant soya bean paste and aromatic spices. The dish was served with potatoes but just too bad that they tasted quite plain, nevertheless they still made a good pairing in making the gravy thicker, looking more scrumptious.Quality beef cheek slow-cooked to perfect softness, easy on the jaws. All was good but the miss was that the Rendang was not strong enough even though the Wagyu was prepared in INDOCAFE's special blend of spices.Kari Ikan was rated the best dish among the rest. The cod fish fillet was fried and even though it is served in authentic Nyonya gravy, the meat still holds on together and would not tear apart easily. Therefore, retaining the texture as it was supposed to be.Stir fried Eggplant dish may be rather simple but its spicy Sambal chilli was something that lift up the entire dish!Chap Chye has a stronger fermented bean curd taste than the usual ones I had elsewhere. The excellent find here is the prawns and pig skin with the standard braised mixed vegetables. As usual the gravy goes well with the refillable plain white rice.Looking at my plate of desserts, I was kind of disappointed as they looked boring to me. In fact, I make a glance over the next table and they had the rainbow lapis which I wold prefer more. Since this portion is individual , it would be good they can served differently for the assorted kuehs for each person. The Peranakan fare we had was above average but it did not have the impressive factor that will imprint a good memory. As far as the restaurant week menu is concern, it will be good to see more selection of Nyonya dishes available like Ayam Buah Keluak, Bakwan Kepiting etc."

We arrived at the restaurant for a very late lunch, and we were literally the only ones there. It was a great escape from the bustling noise of orchard on a Sunday afternoon.The service was great, and the staffs were very knowledgable about the food. To start with, we ordered ""Ngoh Hiang"" under appetizer which was a five-spiced meat wrapped in soy beancurd. I totally recommend this to you guys because it's hella bomb. The meat is so savory, and oily. Just a great dish to start with. For the main we ordered rendang sapi (beef rendang), sambal kangkung (kind of like spinach with chilli), and udang asam nanas pedas (tiger prawns sautéed with pineapple gravy). First of all, the rendang; the ingredients are perfect. Very tasteful. Although the more proper way to cook rendang in Indonesia is to cook it for hours. The rendang here was tender and soft - and yes my boyfriend thought it was good. It is good, but it's not how a rendang should be. Rendang should be hard and stringy, that's why it is normally cooked for more than 1 hour. As an Indonesian, I prefer how it normally should be cooked, but overall it was pretty good.Sambal kangkung was excellent, very tasty and a little bit spicy. I like how everything tastes with the tiger prawn with pineapple gravy, because the sweet taste of the dish balances the savory taste of the rendang and the kangkung. All the food here are a little bit spicy, but then again I am Indonesian so if any of you guys don't eat spicy that much, some of the food here are going to be a little too spicy for you. Or it may taste a bit spicy at first, but the burn will accumulate throughout the course.. So get your glasses of water ready!As for the desert, we ordered warm banana cake topped with ice cream. It was da bomb, so please give it a try when you make your way to the restaurant."

This was first time my wife and son had a peranakan style meal and it was a treat and surprise. On the night we dined, only a couple of other tables were taken (Saturday night, a big surprise ) this restaurant definitely deserves more custom as the food and service was top quality.

It was, and still is,  one of the hidden gems you will tell your friends about, but not post on social media, because you don't want to have to wait too long for a table. But alas, they are too good to keep quiet about. Previously i had come only for dinner, but now they do weekend brunches too. For dinner, I'd recommend the burgers, big portions, be warned. But my fav is the iberico pork ribs, so tasty, so tender. Apparently, for weekday breakfast, they are converted into a coffee shop, so local kopi, chee cheong fun, chwee kuey, the works. They've also recently had a prata store join them, which i sampled. Good prata, the crispy type. For brunch, i had the pork in Duxelle + brioche. Let's just say i wiped the plate clean. Very clean. They probably didn't have to wash it. But I'm sure they did.  If there's anything to complain about, it's probably the coffee. On the weekends, no kopi, only espresso type coffee, which can always be tricky. Need a good barista for that. Not any issue for me at dinner i just drink beers, so give stars at dinner time. For breakfast, still 4.5 stars, the half  taken off for the coffee quality."

I had no idea if someone would sit me down, so I just sat at a table (outdoor area) and a coffee shop patron asked me not to sit there because it was reserved for his friends. Swiftly, there were two young male staff who came to help out and gave me the menu and explained everything (how their shop concept works especially on weekends). The menu was also very disorganised, I had to change my order so many times because there were so many ""weekday specials"", ""weekend specials"", ""weekend brunch specials"", ""student specials"", ""japanese specials"" along with a separate japanese menu, easily 100-150 items on the 2-paged main menu + separate 2-paged drinks menu + separate 2-paged japanese menu, WAH LAO just make it an easy 1-page menu! Luckily the one staff as mentioned before (sorry did not get their names) slowly went through the menus and explained/recommended me some items.Having an open concept kitchen, customers can walk through and look at the kitchen operations whilst they are working. Food handlers were not wearing gloves and kitchen was in a unhygienic state during lunch service (if you want to do stuff dirty then don't allow customers to walk through). When I left the bistro via the back door, food were left all around the back fridges' area! Raw pork, raw beef, fresh vegetables and drinks were all together, on the FLOOR, eeeeewwwww! Uncle at noodle stall was digging his nose and cooking the noodles, not to mention he's so rude! Toilet was in a horrible state, my son could not use the male cubicle because the light was blown and it will be absolutely in darkness when he went in. Staff told me the light has already not been working for 2 weeks and the management refuses to fix it (whattttttttttt).However, I have to mention that the menu was very affordable amongst the whole row of restaurants and the food is okay, not excellent but great for the price. I can recommend: 73 Ribs - Succulent, fall off the bone, tender.Fish and Chips - Tastes like good ol' beer battered fish and good slaw.Wild Mushroom Chicken - The sauce was meh but the chicken was moist.Highly not recommended: 73 Burger - The tempura was too greasy, fries on this plate had no salt and I had to ask for salt myself (the fries on other plates were good)Aglio Olio - It's a mushroom, bacon, chili flakes locally inspired noodle dish. No seasoning too. Don't call it an aglio olio if it's not.Flat white - It's so foamy even when I ordered it flat. Conclusion: Decent food 2.5/5 (pass)Good service 3/5Disgusting hygiene 0/5Bad menu 0/5Bad coffeeshop/bistro concept 0/5Will not come back again until they make clear their operation concept, menu and the HYGIENE!

Sadly, the babi pongteh was flavorful but the meat wasn't tender enough - probably wasn't stewed for long enough. The assam fish head had a yummy sauce but the fish itself was lackluster - slightly fishy, not the best. The Chap Chye was fairly bland which was pretty upsetting. The Nasi Ulam Istimewa was something I was looking forward to since it's hard to find anywhere else, but it somehow just didn't come together right. Perhaps the herb mixture wasn't in the right proportions, or perhaps things weren't sliced up evenly enough to give a good texture...

By the 80s, most of its residents moved to public housing estates leaving behind a small clusters of kopitiams, shophouses and four seafood restaurants. One of these seafood restaurants is Tan Chin Lee, which relocated to its present location at Tuas Amenity Centre, when the original site was redeveloped. Growing up I used to loathe going to the old site for family dinners. Yes, the food was fresh and cheap but you also had to contend with flies by the side of the road. In its present location, Tan Chin Lee is now like any other air-conditioned chinese restaurants. Prices are actually rather reasonable for restaurant standards. Food quality is actually quite good like the Teochew styled steamed fish and the chilli crabs, comparable to the East Coast seafood outlets. But my favourite is actually the included braised peanuts appetizers.Popular with the lunch crowd in the area, it is actually worth 4 stars except for the fact that its in Tuas."

Limitless lobster tails, king crab, prawns, and fresh shucked oysters highlight the seafood. Full sushi bar. Fresh sliced prosciutto. Artisan cheese bar. Prime rib, ham, and charcuterie. And a first for me--a foie gras station. Incredible. Beyond the food and drink, Opus excels with comfortable surroundings, and top notch service. The staff are incredible and attentive. Our champagne flutes were NEVER empty and our plates were always cleared. Manager and executive chef comes to every table to follow up with guests and ask where they can improve. Expect to pay for all this decadence to the tune of $167 SD or $120 USD. I don't care. It was so worth it. My advice is to book and early seating around 12:30 and pace yourself. They started running out of shellfish shortly after 2pm."

Our package included breakfast every morning at the Opus Bar and Grill. My sister and I had mad jet lag so we woke up early and headed downstairs for the breakfast buffet. There were only a couple people up and eating at 6:00 am, so we had the restaurant pretty much all to ourselves.I thought the buffet was very comprehensive with both western and eastern style food. There was also an omelette bar with egg whites only option available. My favorite was the bircher muesli with a mixture of rolled oats, raisin, nuts, fruits, and milk. It went well with the strong latte I ordered. The mini pain au chocolat or chocolate croissant was super delicious as well; perfect in size, buttery, chocolaty, and flaky. Overall, I thought it was smart for us to start breakfast early because it got super busy later on."

It is conveniently located on Orchard Road, inside the Hilton Hotel. When you walk in stay to your right past the reception and head for the back of the hotel. There you will find the restaurant.We didn't have a reservation and showed up around 20h30 and were seated right away. I think we got really lucky...When you walk in, along the back wall, you can see the kitchen although it is closed off from the main dining room.We started with a cocktail. A Macallan 12 for him and Lychee Martini for me, which was delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness and served with two lychees on top.Oh... And they had a promotion going. Order a steak and you get free wine with dinner. Can't beat it!So before our food gets there, they present us with this huge loaf of cheese bread. His eyes rolled in the back of his head when he tasted it, so I can only assume it was delish...He had the Tomato Burrata as a starter which was served with a heaping pile of Arugula. It was very fresh.I started with the Mushroom Velouté. It is served with a drizzle of Truffle Oil on top and a slice of Bread with Grilled Parmesan and Emmental cheese on top. The soup itself was not heavy and had a very good mushroom flavor. It was smooth without being overly creamy. And the Truffle Oil was just enough for a hint of the taste without being overwhelming like most places serve it. I thoroughly enjoyed it.He followed with a Filet Mignon with Peppercorn sauce and fries.I had the Wild Sea Bass. It is cooked to perfection! The skin side is crispy and delicious. It comes in a broth with clams, Black mussels, artichoke, vine tomatoes and thyme. If you are looking for a light, yet satisfying meal, I highly recommend it. I couldn't get enough of the fish! In addition, I had a side helping of the Grilled Asparagus. Lovely!"

While Hilton Singapore may not have the most extensive spread, they make up for it in terms of the cosy ambience and quality selections in some of their a la minute sections. Highlights of the new buffet spread include live seafood, meat carving and grill stocked with fresh imported ocean catches, premium Australian cuts and gourmet delicatessen from Europe.I typically start with the cured meats and cheeses and i was very happy at the Smorgasbord Station, which featured thinly-sliced à la minute charcuterie of imported whole leg Iberico ham, Lomo Ham and Saucisson sec cured meat.I went absolutely crazy with the bleu cheeses! There are more than 20 types of cheeses specially flown in from Italy, France and Switzerland. Best bleu spread ever.At the live Seafood Station, you get to taste sashimi and half shell scallops from Australia, Canadian-Maine Lobsters, yabbies (a type of crayfish) from Spain and shucked oysters from Australia, Canada and France. I skipped this section as they didn't smell too appealing. I thought the hot food fared better. With eight cooking stations, there is plenty to pick from. A la minute specialty dishes such as pan-fried foie gras with apple and passion fruit (really enjoyed the tartness but the foie gras was overcooked), fresh homemade Italian maccheroni pasta with juicy Maine lobster meat and yabbies...And HELLO homemade Scotch egg with black truffle hollandaise! Even though some of my dining partners felt that the sausage crust was a tad salty, i thought it was perfect with the yolk (it's overcooked and they certainly could do better than that). The amount of sodium is perfectly acceptable if you think of it as a sausage #YOLO.Hearty, meaty offerings include Australian grain-fed prime rib, honey mustard-glazed pork rack and slow-grilled herb-roasted baby fowl. I enjoyed the meats from the open-flame charcoal grills. Cuts of wagyu flank steaks, lamb chops and Rangers Valley grain-fed beef tenderloins are sizzled over white-hot charcoal. Do not go expecting medium rare meats though, they all turn fairly medium-medium done. Don't skip the delicious sides of vegetables like roasted tomatoes on the vine, caramelized pumpkin, and asparagus gratin! I believe the Asian Station could be skipped. Oh but don't miss the liu sha bao! I was surprised at how good it was. That was truly a hidden gem in the dim sum corner. Dessert is a highlight at Hilton Singapore. With over 30 sweet treats like the luscious caramel hazelnut chocolate fountain -tears of joy-, cakes, mousse, tarts, pralines and macarons... it's pure heaven for the sheer amount of variety. The Hilton Singapore Sunday Champagne Brunch is available every Sunday from noon to 3pm, only at Opus Restaurant, located on the ground level."

I was happily corrected.The food at UNA was top notch, and it wasn't even that expensive.My friend and I ordered 4 tapas items, one main, two desserts, and a glass of sherry, all for $80 nett each. That's not CHEAP, but it was definitely good value. We ended up paying even less because there was a promo for a free dessert with every main when booking through Chope, so end result? $73 per person, net. For really really good food.Tapas-wise we ordered the croquettas, the grilled octopus, ox-cheek bruschetta, and clams in sherry. The croquettas were disappointing only in the size of the portion. Three balls of ABSOLUTELY AMAZING CREAMY GOODNESS. Good, tasty bits of ham nestled in oozy luscious Bechamel sauce. Piping hot. The grilled octopus current ranks as #2 in Singapore on my list, flavourful with a good meaty texture, they're only surpassed by Osteria Mozza's rendition. The clams in sherry (or was it white wine... whichever, clams in alcohol) were good but unspectacular. The clams were very fresh, succulent and tasty. The broth was so good we soaked up every bit with the bread we had. I didn't like the ox-cheek so much, the bruschetta was as tough as leather, and the meat while superbly tender, didn't really have a flavour that I liked. My friend really like it though, so this was clearly a matter of taste.Our main, the grilled Iberian pork, didn't really do it for either of us. It was... tasty. Juicy. Well charred. It was technically excellent, but for some reason just didn't appeal to our palates. I couldn't fault it though. It definitely set out all it intended to do, in terms of texture, cook, taste... It was just a matter of the marinade/taste/flavours that didn't grab us.For desserts, the bitter chocolate ice cream is worth a miss. It's listed on the menu as 'with olive oil and sea salt'. Those components were no where to be seen. The churros, on the other hand, were exemplary. Crisp exterior, fluffy interior, great chocolate sauce and the honey ice cream. The ambience of the place also is a huge factor. A lot of the seats are al-fresco, and the grill is located outside the main house, by the dining area. There's a real charm to the outdoor setting, having the chef in line of sight, grilling up meats and seafood, the entire area with a herbed, smokey, smell. It's, for lack of a better word, just incredibly charming. I can't say much more to convince you of how impressed I was beyond the fact that I've already made another booking for the coming Tuesday, just one week after my first visit. Yes ladies and gentlemen, it was that good."

It was the perfect setting for any weddings, private events and of course, a lazy Sunday brunch with good company.  The brunch started with a little confusion as I thought the indoor buffet SPREAD consists of only the cold, seafood platter and the salads selection, while the rest shown on the menu had to be ordered. Only later did I realize that some of the tapas such as Machego Cheese and Membrillo, Sourdough Bread and Alioli and Anchovies, Tomatoes and Jalepenos were already displayed as part of the buffet SPREAD. The UNA's signature egg benedict is the dish to order as it is hard to find another version that can CONSOLIDATE the deep umami flavours of both smoky mackerels and bonito flakes into one. The paprika heat was mild but I wondered if flatbread worked well as a base as it was limp and chewy, making the dish quite ""flat"" without any textural contrast. From the grills section, the chicken wings with mojo picon were rather disappointing as the smoky and spicy flavors of this classic red pepper sauce was elusive, failing to lift up the wings that looked as if they were rushed hastily from the marinade container to the tables. Found at the bottom end of the loin, this prized cut from the acorn-fed Iberico pigs have a very nice marbling and sliced off as easily as Wagyu beef. It seems like the forte of the meats lie in the pigs as I heard that another pork dish, Pinchos morunos, was also EXCELLENT. But I was already very satisfied with this cut and this is definitely THE dish to order. While one may get the value back by eating plates of excellent grilled meats or eggs, it would be great if there were other seafood OPTIONS such as fish. Even though the highlights may be understandably the Spanish tapas and grills, I felt the team was doing themselves injustice as the pedestrian desserts looked dubiously outsourced.Regardless of the variety, the quality of the desserts should at least match up with the theme of the brunch. Switching to offering some of the desserts from the regular menu will be a good start."

For Spanish paella, we are happy to trot down to UNA at One Rochester. Plus it's a fantastic spot to wind down with sangria in this lovely colonial bungalow with fairy lights. The menu consists of Spanish offerings of tapas, paellas and parilla (grill) specialties.You will not go wrong with the crowd-pleasing Gambas Al Ajillo ($22), made with fresh tiger prawns sautéed in olive oil, white wine, garlic, parsley and a kick of chili. We couldn't stop dipping the bread into the aromatic infused olive oil.  The Patatas Bravas ($10) may seem plain but the potato bites were wonderfully crispy. The spicy tomato-base brava sauce and aioli made them even more irresistible.Skip the Coca De Higos Y Foie Con Vermouth ($26). The thick cubes of liver on the biscuit-like Spanish flatbread didn't work for me. An ideal slice of foie gras should spread nicely and moisten the buttery bread (preferably brioche) with its fat. In this case, the fat has yet to be rendered and the mouthfeel is akin to chomping on soy beancurd and crackers.  Definitely order the Pulpo A La Parrilla Con Papas Arrugadas Y Mojo ($32). This is one of the best octopus I've had this year. The charred crispy skin is a result of the charcoal grill but the white flesh remained tender and sweet. For a little bit of creaminess, give it a dab of the coriander and pimentón sauce.   All i remembered of the Fideua De Calamares ($20) was that it's fried beehoon (actually it's Fideos pasta) in squid ink sauce, baked in the cast iron skillet. The local baby squid were crispy with a creamy center but they were really fishy morsels. The rest of the dish was bland and oily. Guess we should stick with paella here at UNA. The Paella De Chorizo Y Habitas ($46 small / $66 large), provided the usual comfort from this Spanish arroz Bomba dish. The aromatic saffron rice was punctuated with a savory chorizo, fava beans and an aioli sauce. I thought the rice was a little wetter than the usual paella but it was delicious nonetheless. For proteins, the Pescado A La Parilla ($42) fared better than the Cochinillo Asado ($36). The latter was a piece of dry Spanish suckling pig with a thick, hard, and bland crust. The fish on the other hand, though simply grilled with thyme, garlic, and lemon, was a lot more appetizing.Onto desserts, an interesting sweet to end the night is the Queso Fresco Calabaza Y Membrillo ($14), a creamy cheese mousse complemented by roasted pumpkin ice cream, quince and walnuts. Have this instead of the oily Churros Con Chocolate y Cafe ($14). The churros were probably fried at a low heat and they were quite oily. We'd rather eat the coffee-flavored chocolate mousse on its own. Hits and misses at UNA at One Rochester. Thankfully they have a super potent Sangria ($18) that is sure to make you forget the bad stuff. Go for the red one! The other cocktails are not quite worth the calories IMO."

It made one want to reach for some buns to dip in the sauce. The crab was chopped up for easy handling although tool and disposable gloves were provided.Claypot Black Pepper Crab 砂煲黑椒螃蟹 ($78)The sauce was fiery and strong, and more on the salty side for me. Not the usually sweet version which I preferred but still tasted not bad. The meat was thick and chunky.Authentic Claypot Curry Fish Head 砂煲咖哩鱼头 ($26.80)The curry fish head was cooked chinese style, with lady's fingers, onion, tomatoes, eggplant, dried bean curd sheet, bean curd puffs, and curry leaves. Felt that the fish was steamed before pouring the gravy all over it, as the meat did not soak up the flavours of the rich lemak gravy. The gravy was very rich which made one wishing for a bowl of plain rice to go with.Crispy Roasted Duck (Regular) 天王脆皮烧鸭 ($16)It was served with plum sauce.

The skin was not too thick, which made it quite a mouthful bite. Char Siew Bao 叉烧包 ($4.60)The pau was soft and fluffy, packed with chunky savoury filling, which I felt a tab too salty. It was different from the commonly found sweet version.Mango Sago Pomelo 杨枝甘露 ($3.50)The dessert was creamy and refreshing without too sweet."

The Jurong Point mall is unique (at least for an American) that each food court is country themed. Within the Malaysian food court (Malaysia Boleh!), they've set up carts inside as if it were a street food market - really neat and fun set up. It's a cute take on the popular Singaporean hawker center idea. The food here is some of the best I've had in Singapore. I love the Claypot Chicken (savory, sauced, and nicely crispy), Penang Laksa (tangy, sweet, delicious noodle soup), and the Chendol (best I had in Singapore and Malaysia - unique palm sugar shaved ice dessert). The iced tea and iced coffee are also delicious and served up from the center ""tree"" stand.Seating is plentiful, albeit always crowded. The bussers are quick and friendly, and do a good job keeping the place clean. Would highly recommend this food court to anyone visiting Singapore who wants to have many options of great Malaysian food."

The latter part of the question has long since evolved...since I already know the answer to the original question. It will ALWAYS have something to do with spirituality and definitely something to do with both food and drinks. So I was not even slightly surprised when my mind reflected on a similar question about two months ago. What am I going to do (or get done) now that I have about 2 months left in Singapore (and as of today, about 2 more weeks)? I began a mental list of all the foods I will immediately miss (or have little access to) when I go back to the US. As the list began to grow, I eventually spotted the recurring theme...and it had to do with GOOD chicken rice.So when a good friend recently asked me how my Singaporean Chicken Rice pilgrimage has been since our last meal together, I shared how I've tried about 60+ spots with some only inspiring enough to warrant a review. I told him that while most of the chicken were similar (guessing a good number of them buy direct from a wholesaler)...the hit or miss has been entirely up to the rice, the chilli and minced ginger, as well as the side dishes (if I so choose to order them).He then asked me if I have tried Ipoh-style Chicken Rice in the process of this pilgrimage and I shared how I've only had it once at Bishan with my relatives (and thought that it was delightful). Hearing this, he asked to do lunch and requested that I meet him at Jurong Point before usual lunch hour hordes.So he ordered while I sat at one of the many tables available and when he brought over a half chicken and the famous Ipoh beansprouts, he grinned and asked if I wanted to take pictures for my review. I replied, ""You really are that sure I'm going to like this huh?""I snapped away...I dug in and ate away...and I eventually found myself taking a picture of their stall as well (to which they asked me if I was a tourist...from...China...WTH, NOPE)...The flavor of the chicken is slightly different from the standard Singapore chicken rice spots and different in a good way as it really highlights the flavor and essence of the chicken. Definitely something I'll have to do again right before I leave since it's so close to my grandmother's place! Always hit 2 birds with 1 stone they say!Yelp 100: 46/100"

I particularly like the Claypot chicken rice - delicious and hot, just the way I like.I tried almost all the stores there and the food quality is pretty decent, prices are slightly on the steep side since its in a shopping mall, not surprising about that. Portion may be on the smaller side but you should be satisfied with the food quality. Of course you can't compare it to the ones in Malaysia but if you don't have the time to go there, this is the closest you can get. I would recommend you to try the Laska, 'po piah' and 'Chendol' dessert, along with the Claypot Chicken Rice as they are often my regular meals there as they seemed better to me than others, and  there is a long queue at one of the stalls, I haven't tried that but was told it's pretty nice, so do check that out too and I will, probably on my next visit! Overall, I think it's worth a visit and try to avoid the peak hours as usually the place gets crowded, in fact the mall would be crowded during these times."

You have to jostle with everyone else to get a seat and when you do, you can't split yourself up to chope the table and order simultaneously. At hawker centres, one end up roaming back and forth looking to scalp a corner seat, quickly wolf down whatever is ordered and get the hell out. So I looked forward to him coming to Singapore. That gives me the opportunity to take him out to discover the Singaporean food scene. Things I have always wanted to try but never did (on my own). And finally to enjoy his dining company and the food.Sunset Grill was on top of my list because so much have been mentioned by so many friends. Having dinner here is like being in an improv theatre. That night when we were there, this group of friends was sitting right across us and they made the bold attempt to finish 12 wings between the 3 guys at the off-menu hotness level. The 4 others chickened out (pun unintended).Whilst we were sweating away at our level 1's they were huffing and puffing their way through level 35's. One could not talk, one ended up looking faint and the last person was sweating profusely, we could see their girlfriend's worry break through the make-up. We both ended up highly entertained as we cheered them on. Many say that Singapore is boring. But I beg to differ. Fun is what you make of the situation. Him and me, we do the most boring stuff. We eat, watch movies, shop, gym & swim and after he leaves for home, work. But everytime I was with him, somehow there is always a new sensation, a new experience and a new story to tell. Unfortunately, the story with him has ended for now."

For that, I had to give it one star less because there's really nothing spectacular about the food but the atmosphere made everything extra special. Sadly, it's now moved to Jalan Kayu and I've not had a chance to try it yet.Nonetheless, most people visit Sunset Grill and Pub for its famous buffalo wings. Those devil wings are rated 1 to 10 in spiciness level. To be honest, the missus and I never bothered to try anything pass level 1 because we'd like to keep our taste buds intact and functioning to taste the nuances in our food. But many people like to go there to challenge themselves. By all means! They do serve some carrot and celery sticks with the wings to help clean the palette. Usually missus would order extra servings of raw veg (at a price) to help tahan the spice.We can only hope that the food standards have not changed and the ambience of Jalan Kayu is half as good as its former location."

Some of our favourite dishes are:(i) Tofu salad - contains very soft tofu, thin konbu, nori, white fish, and tomato, tied together with a Japanese style vinaigrette (on one visit they substituted a more citrusy dressing which completely threw off the flavour balance but thankfully they have reverted to the correct dressing)(ii) Tori/tara/buta kurozu - a Japanese version of sweet and sour chicken/fish/pork which tastes nothing like the Chinese version. Served with carrots, potatos, eggplant and mini lotus root.(iii) Ootoya lunch - fried chicken chunks and a korroke (deep fried potato and minced pork patty) topped with a sunny side up egg.(iv) Warabi mochi dessert, served with a light and icy milk ice cream.Note that most people won't take well to their soy milk porridge, which develops a slimy texture with a little stirring - don't order this if it's your first visit!"

Since the closure of that food center, I have been in search of this stall and I finally found it by chance.Their prices are extremely reasonable as the owner explained that rent is reasonable in Mandai. A Bowl of Laksa noodles cost just SGD$2.50, and my bowl of pork rib noodle cost $4.00. Not only is it value for money, the old school taste of their noodles are excellent. Definitely recommend this stall to anyone who is swinging by this area."

We counted at least 8-9 vegetable dishes (okra, eggplants, si ji dou, long beans, leeks, garlic bulbs, broccoli, a few kinds of leafy vegetables, carrots and more). The meat dishes are quite minimal, probably just a handful. But all the dishes displayed looked very fresh and appetizing.

But, its so fantastic that I can't help but rave on about it.Besides the AMAZING FOOD, very friendly aunties that serve and take your order, efficiency, and wide variety of drinks (including home made barley), this place is one of the few places around Orchard that you can get fantastic, satisfying, indulgent food at $15 per head. Worthy of special mention would be their beef / seafood hor fun. As mentioned, its usually sold out by lunchtime, so don't wait till dinner if you are dying to try it. The servings are very generous, with lots of beef / seafood and vegetables - it could really make for a meal on its own.  However, the deep fried prawn paste chicken here is to die for, so it's a must for me whenever I go.  On one of the occasions where the hor fun had run out, we also tried the Singapore fried noodle which was still really really good! So don't lose the plot if you get here and the hor fun has run out - try the fried noodles instead - you won't be disappointed!"

This place isn't as good as those, but it's a place I would most definitely come back to the next time I come back to Singapore. Don't let the fact that it's in a mall predispose you against giving it a try. It won't knock your socks off with a two by four, but it's good, decent ramen."

I had read about the Akamaru Shin-Aji ""Modern Tonkatsu"" ramen and came here prepared to order it. Perhaps my expectations had been too hyped up. I was expecting an out-of-this-world broth that would blow my mind and scream ""umami""! Reality: Very good though nothing incredible. The broth was a tad too oily for my liking and not as flavorful as advertised. I ordered the special so it came with ajitsuke-tamago (flavored egg), char siew cubes and bamboo shoots. I personally prefer my ramen eggs to be on the slightly runny side and the yolk in this one was 75% hardened. The char siew slices that came in the ramen itself was fantastic (soft and flavorful), but the cubes were a a little too dry and hardened. It's hard to get bamboo shoots wrong so I finished all of that. I don't care much for ramen noodles themselves, so I won't comment on the texture or quality. Overall, I'd say Ippudo is a dependable brand of ramen. I'd compare it to Starbucks maybe - decent and consistent but not memorable. Just like how if you really wanted a special kind of coffee you'd go to a family-owned café, if you really a special bowl of ramen, you'd go for those hole-in-the-wall places, ideally run entirely by Japanese staff."

Their regular ramen starts from $15, not including Singapore's ++ Syndrome (7% GST + 10% Service Charge)I really like the fact that they ask for your noodle texture preference - soft, medium or hard! I dunno about you, but I'm pretty picky about enjoying my noodles al dente. Medium texture is perfect for that! To be honest, the taste of the ramen itself is probably only worth about 3 stars. The broth is incredibly rich and borderline too fatty & oily. The portions are probably not worth the price but hey, you're technically paying for the brand! The real standout is actually the char siu pork - so flavourful and tender! The extra star goes out to the staff who were super sweet that day. I accidentally left my camera at the table and they actually came out of the restaurant to try and find me. After I realised what had happened, I went back and they had kept my camera safely at the front counter for me. Really appreciated that gesture and it was one of those rare instances that I didn't mind the extra service charge one bit!"

I ordered the Akamaru Tamago and the pork bun. The ramen was very good and definitely redeemed my thoughts about Ippudo in Singapore. The pork bun was a bit underwhelming having tried the pork belly buns in NY...perhaps it was because the NY ones were pork belly instead of just pork...the fat really must've made the difference haha.I would definitely come back at an odd time to avoid the wait again.

I had the char siew ramen. The broth I had was overly salty, and left me very thirsty for a very long time after. Too much MSG i suppose.

Shoyu ramen- Nice crunchy noodles- Good broth, light and not too heavy. Perfect for those who prefer clear soup rather than a thick, creamy broth.2. Love the egg tamargo! - So used to having my tamargo cold and placed on top a shushi but Ippudo's take on the hot tamargo has changed my stereotype of it being a solely cold dish. Definitely like it hot better now (not many japanese restaurants serve it this way). - Their tamargo is like an omelette but slightly sweeter. However, the only downside is the 1-2 hour queue :( definitely not worth the long wait. I recommending going during odd hours like 3pm (no queue)."

We arrived around 8PM and it seemed to be a good time to come, as tables were turning over.We managed to secure our own table (there appeared to be options for a more communal, big table experience too.I ordered the Shiromaru Special - that included an egg, bamboo shoots and cubed pork, served on a side plate. Generally the ramen was nice and firm, and the broth was rich. I would've appreciated if they had actually served the special, with the extras IN the ramem - as they tasted cold when left on the side plate.I've sought out many ramen places in my (short) lifetime thus far, and while Ippudo ranks in the upper half, it definitely isn't the best I've had.

However, I was not too fond of the ambience at Ippudo with loud music playing in the background, a stark contrast to the other quieter and more relaxing restaurants in the building. The tonkotsu ramen, though, I really liked. The soup was good enough to drink. The noodles were springy in texture while the pork belly was soft and decadent. The egg was also cooked just nice with a slight runny yolk. The normal ramen costs $16 while the egg added an additional $3, but was well worth it. The sides, on the other hand, was less outstanding. I did not really like the rather tough gyoza and though the shrimp mayo was rather good, it wasn't quite worth the $13 for 4 shrimps. Ippudo is slightly pricey with an average meal costing about $25 to $30 with drinks, but the ramen lives up to its reputation. The biggest thing putting me off though is the queue which goes round a table inside the small restaurant and out of the restaurant, and groups with 3 or more people will not be seated until everyone is present.

Having been to an Ippudo outlet in Japan before in Yokohama, I'd say the only similarities between them are the long snaking queues. When it comes to the ramen, the portions and condiments found in Ippudo here pale in comparison. Taste wise, I can honestly say it is very close, say 85% to what I had in Japan. The service staff here are decent but compared to the ones at Santouka, pale in comparison.

That's a lot of dosh for some noodles! Granted, we also ordered some very over priced limonata and a gyoza to share, but still... I found myself questioning whether the quality/price ratio was in order. I had the poor belly ramen with the seasoned egg, and yes, the meat is tender and the egg was perfectly soft boiled, but I did find the noodles rather salty. You choose the texture of your noodle and I can't say I found much of a difference between my boyfriend's firm and my soft! You can pay a few dollars to have your noodles replenished if you have enough soup left in the bowl. This is always tempting when placing your initial order but we manage to reign it in by the time we have slurped up our bowls. The service is Japanese friendly, with the welcoming ""moshy moshy"" being yelled out left right and centre. Service is also efficient - good when you're waiting (and willing that waiting line to go faster), but leaves you feeling a little short changed when you've eaten your $35 meal in about 15 minutes! Jury is out, I might go back for a third time, but I probably should try out one of the many other ramen options out there first!"

Typical chinese restaurant, the Soup Restaurant's theme lean towards authentic Chinatown appeal, partnered with its hard wood seating area. We ordered the pork and winter melon soup and a chicken beggar's bowl. The rice meal is meant for budget-conscious people (that we are). But when we were served, it was suprising to see that the bowl is overflowing with this white fluffy rice, hainanese chicken, and veggies. Aside from that, it definitely did go well with that shredded ginger side. It was trully a filling meal.Although some of the staff were quite accommodating and knowledgeable enough to guide first timers through their menu, there was one who stood out. Not because of her outstanding customer service, but with her outstanding rudeness. As paying customers, we have every right to ask for anything on the menu, even if it's just a water refill. Everytime we call for a refil,she aways spills on our table and it's not the accidental spill-it's the ""I want to go home so stop asking for refills"" type of spill.I'm not sure if I'm going back to eat at their restaurant if a person with that type of attitude is still there. However, I will still patronize their food and probably have it take away."

It's more a casual eatery serving food meant to evoke the nostalgia of Chinatown in the 1950s or 1960s. I call it casual because I wouldn't plan to come here or make reservations beforehand or dress up for dinner. I wouldn't go as far to say the food is disappointing because it is decent enough.The Samsui Ginger Chicken is the only steamed chicken I would eat and even then I only eat the breast meat without the skin, just a personal preference. But the chicken is tender and best eaten with the minced ginger or wrapped in a lettuce leaf. It's the perfect blend of salty and sweet. Also try the Hometown Tofu, especially nice with the crispy dried shrimp. And wash down the meal with hot chrysanthemum tea.For some reason, mobile reception is horrible inside. You can hardly make a call or send a text."

Another dish that we ordered is the black chicken with dried scallops. This is indeed one of the nicest soups we've had: savory and full of all sorts of ingredients such as mushrooms, red dates and other miscellaneous herbs.

Trying a restaurant for the first time always gives me a sense of adventure and having to find the ""door"" to this restaurant is the start of the adventure. After having read reviews online that looking out for the door to the restaurant is tricky. We originally wanted to give ourselves that challenge to look for that elusive ""door"". After awhile we caved and asked the SA. When we finally arrived at the ""door"" dawned in antique gold, something whispered into my ear, ""Open me and it will the start of a wonderful culinary adventure!"" Once you step in, it's like you have entered into another world that was unexpected from before. The restaurant was dimly lit, cosy and had a romantic feel. It was also a tad small, so I suggest you make reservations way in advance if you need to celebrate a special occasion with your significant other. Our order for the evening:1. Jumbo crab cakes- I liked the fact that because they knew we were sharing, they split the portion into 2 individual portions.- OMG this has got to be one of the best crab cake in Singapore! Imagine sweet snd succulent but more importantly meaty (not crab shavings) crab flesh carefully moulded tightly within a light batter that tasted a little like slightly crusty Parmesan cheese and carefully placed on what tasted like light lemon mayo aioli. The light lemon flavor complemented the crab meat well and brought out the sweetness of the crab flesh even more. To me the experience was simply divine. Definitely a must-try!2. Ribeye with salt and pepper corn crust -  For the ribeye, you have got a choice of how you would like the beef to be done, sweet or savory. - BF chose the savory option which was with salt and peppercorn crust - In fact it was the crust that brought out the flavor of the beef and gave it a slight edge against a regular ribeye. - The beef was nice but I think for what's worth we have tasted better steaks at other joints. 3. Kurobuta pork with spiced apple jam- So I read a review of a prominent food critic and wondered why he chose to eat the kurobuta pork vs the beef. After trying for myself, I understood why. -  Presentation-wise it doesn't look like much. But when you start to slice the pork with your knife, you will realize how tender it is. Put Abit of the spiced apple Jam on the pork and you'll be in porky pig heaven! -  The only con about this was that the pork was fatty. But then I am sure it's required to allow the entire piece of meat to be marbled and tender to such amazing goodness level!  4. Sides: Kale salad with peanuts- The kale salad is one of the signature sides. - The kale was sliced in thin shreds and tossed in a refreshing dressing that tasted like it had light honey mustard, lemon, mint etc. - It's definitely a good complement to any mains but I only wished they didn't put in so much dressing. It overpowered the crisp and crunch of kale which i personally preferred. 5. Sides: Old fashioned potato hash-  One word, WOW! - so this is like a pancake of rosti, only thing different is that it is 85% crisped through! This is like the ""NEW FRY"" I tell you...- Something that I would order again if I were to go back! Shiok! 6. Dessert: Key lime pie (deconstructed)- By the time you are done with your mains and sides, you won't have much room for dessert. So we ordered the lightest on the menu.- This dessert didn't put a smile on my face.- In my opinion, there wasn't much crust or bite into this dessert, it was just filled with a lot of creamy meringue and lots of lemon curd. I am a fan of lemon curd but that was way too much! Presentation was nice but that's all to it I'm afraid. On the whole, my BF and I had an amazing dining experience.

I love the sprinkling of ritz crackers over the dish and it is just the right proportion of cheesy creaminess against the al dente pasta. The Travis burger is juicy and full of beefy goodness. It is served with crunchy coleslaw and crispy fries. The crab cake is another delight. It is chockful of real crabmeat and little else. I liked how the server was willing to serve the portion on two plates when requested as we were sharing, It is a small intimate place which has a few alcove like tables for two, giving a bit of privacy to diners.

Food was out of the question for me, as I've experienced sticker shock at their Gemmill Lane outlet in the past ($24 for lobster sliders?! $105 for lobster pot pie?!)Finding it isn't too difficult if you see where it is on the outside. Just find that corner on the 3rd floor overlooking Orchard Road and you'll notice the sleek doors in no time. Once inside, you'll notice how cool this outlet is- navy walls, dim lighting, and decent views of the shopping crowds. The drinks menu is pretty substantial. They have lots of wines and a full bar to choose from. They can even do bespoke cocktails, but I believe it'll cost you a little extra. I loved how they had this interesting cocktail that I unfortunately forgot the name of, but it's description was very vague- named after a Mr. Connelly who wears pink shorts, and when you order this drink, you must ask for extra onions.* But after much discussion I decided to stick with the tried and true Rock & Rye. It's their signature cocktail that involves rye whiskey steeped with various ingredients (some secret) over weeks. I had it on the rocks and I loved it! It starts off as citrus-y and ends very warmly (probably due to the cinnamon.) To me, it tasted like autumn and Thanksgiving!For my second round, I had Johnny Drum bourbon, aged 15 years, neat. Part of my reason for choosing it was price, as it was one of the cheapest on the menu at $19. It was actually quite lovely and I highly recommend it as well.When we walked in around 6 PM on a Friday, there was no one there, so it's a great place to start the weekend if you don't have reservations and plan on going somewhere else after. And hey, if anyone wants to host a fancy UYE here, I'm down. :)--*Mr. Connelly is supposedly a regular at Luke's, and if you drink there enough, they're willing to name a drink after you! #NewLifeGoal"

I've been here twice, once for a lunch date and the other for a group dinner. Just to find this place, you need to walk to through the Robinson's in the Heeren and ask around to where you will find what looks like a backdoor to nowhere only to find a beautiful and sleek modern restaurant. That's really cool.For lunch, my gf ordered the Lobster Roll and I got the burger. We also ordered a dozen oysters which surprisingly weren't that fresh tasting. The lobster roll was overly salty and truly not all that great at all with an overly soft bun that doesn't hold the meat well. The burger, however, was something that hit the spot for my gourmet burger craving. I would go as far to say it is the best gourmet burger here in Singapore (gourmet meaning a tasty thick patty that requires nothing but the bun and and maybe another light addition like cheese or sauce). For dinner, my two friends and I all ordered one of their steak dishes. We all remember this as a great dinner but for sure was way more expensive than we thought was proper. Ambiance is great, service is good although food comes out very slow so give yourself time, and the food in total is OK but not enough to be wow'd or for the most part, not worth the cost. Drink menu is pretty typical for a steak joint (penicillins, old fashioneds, etc.). Give it a shot, for sure try out the burger. :)"

The lunch reservation was made through Michael, the general manager of the restaurants who is so obliging when I had to make changes to my appointment a few times.The restaurant is very well hidden within the new mall - Robinson - level 3, The Hereen @Orchard. The signage wasn't very visible but since it faces the main street, I know which direction I should be heading to within the departmental store. That being said, spot the small wooden door with a gold plate that reads the restaurant name within the new women-wear fashion label ""Still"".The orders were taken prompt without turning down my special requests. I visit with the aim for the Travis burger, available only on lunch menu. It seems that they knew people like sharing out and so, they offer to portion 2 mains and plate half of each into 1. That's a clever move, unless u prefer finishing up a main course on your own, the classic norm.I am forewarned that the Luke's Lobster Roll (S$45) require slight more time to serve and yes, it arrived in 20-30mins together with the Travis beef burger. It is perfectly fine for me as I don't rush for good stuff. Quality is what I have been rewarded for the wait. Go for the lobster slider: if there's only 1 main you can have. Succulent chunks of fresh lobster meat filled the golden pan toasted bun, lightly buttered. A dash of mayo with some sorta lemony taste seems to transform the seafood magically into a dish far better than a prized foie gras or a champ snow beef cut. I have been lobstering at other places but the perfect way to conquer it and present it before your eyes, yes, Luke's Oyster and Chop House certainly has emerged from the crowd. I'm very impressed with the house's lobster sandwich, I claimed one of the very best, the crowd pleaser. The Travis beef burger (S$27) was good too. Unlike some tasteless beef-clad sandwiches, the beef patty arrived tender and moist. The rosy centre lend a deep flavour and heightened by a nice crisp at its edges while its medium cooked center was so juicy that I don't remember pairing each mouthful with any beverage. The mustard-mayo zest up the sandwich a little more while the pickles add a bit of tang to it. The high-quality beef sandwich is truly the heartthrob of many regulars. If you want a taste of the beef burger, be sure to visit at lunch time before it is nowhere to be found in the dinner menu. The shoe string fries are so very addictive! Each strands are deep fried to golden, scented in rosemary and dusted in a handful of old bay seasoning mixture. Alternatively, you may consider swopping the french fries to a creamy potato puree and topping it up for S$8, here I have got a small iron-cast serving. It was so worthy! If you adore a rich and creamy version, this one will definitely melt you away. The signature dessert is not to be missed, you meal wouldn't have a nice closure without the enchanting sweets. The Banana & Coconut Tart with Avocado Ice-cream (S$16) is a must have. The sweet coconut crumb has the texture of an Italian biscuit and a discerning coconut flavour, a tropical disposition. What matters most, is the vast mouthfeel experience when the icy cold met with the warm banana tart underneath. The tart was cleverly baked less sweet so that it marries perfectly with the nectarous avocado ice-cream, without the need to feel cloying. Bon appetit, yelpers!"

The tenderloin I had was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I would recommend a visit. It is a small restaurant so I am sure reservations are required on primo nights.

Ok maybe the carafe of wine made them taste better than usual, but what is lamb without some good wine. If you can find this place I am guessing you will enjoy it. Look on the third floor of a department store and you might find it. I personally asked at the makeup counter. But if you want to be above the hustle of Orchard road it is worth the search. Oh ya, they served some corn bread with a butter chaser as a teaser. Cornbread is nothing without butter. I wish I could spell asparagus because it was a nice compliment with the lamb. Thank god for word recognition on Apple. The sauces with the lamb and asparagus were subtle but effective. Just a hint of mint. Oh shit now I need to pay the bill.

I have always given 5-star ratings to those who are brave enough to venture out into the harsh unforgiving and often times brutal arena that is F&B in Singapore armed with little more than a burning desire to bring you what they believe to be good to eat and drink.  They absolutely deserve all the feeble help my timid Yelp can give them!Ok, so TAP...lTAP is brought to you by the same folks that brought you Thirsty, the lovable  neighborhood bottle shop that carried a very good collection of American craft beers which when they first started ran afoul of my taste buds when I got a six pack of ""old"" Blue Moon.  The stock is certainly a lot fresher than it used to be and besides being a good thing in and of itself, is also a fair indicator of just how much more Singaporeans are interested in and therefore more willing to fork over serious money for craft beer. This is a fairly recent thing and a very good thing for food and drink in Singapore.  Sit at the bar at TAP, or visit Thirsty or The Great Beer Experiment or Druggist and you'll hear more than a fair share of requests for IPAs, something that I have some mixed feelings about. While I am happy that my fellow Singaporeans are exploring the wide and wondrous world of beer and venturing outside their comfort zones of the national-brand lagers like Heineken, Carlsberg, and Tiger, I am a concerned that the IPA is going the way of single origin beans in Singapore, being smothered by that miasma of hipness and being slowly and smugly co-opted as a symbol of sophistication by hipsters.  I suppose I really can't knock anything that keeps those kegs actively rotating, and the last thing anybody wants is a beer yenta sitting next to them at the bar...so I'll shut up and sip my beer.As mentioned before, the beers at TAP are disproportionately well-represented by American craft breweries like Stone, Modern Times, Lost Coast and occasionally Mike Hess.  This being Singapore, the key is to capture the attention of walk-ins as there are no ""regulars"" to speak of, customers that come back regularly for the same thing, so TAP keeps the lineup interesting and it keeps changing.   At the time of this writing, they just hosted a UK takeover with some very decent ales, some of my personal favourites being the Pale Fire by Pressure Drop, Fourpure's IPA, Cali by Tiny Rebel, Bibble by Wild Beer, Pompelmocello by Siren and the very gravid, very ponderous Tsar Generation 4 by one of my all time favourite UK breweries, Buxton.As I think I mentioned in my review of NickelDime, it is a very nice coincidence that all these places that have ales on tap in Singapore are carving out their individual niches, so you can get some of the most highly rated beers from all over the world in a very small space.  Anytime you have that kind of varietal density, it's a good thing, a happy event, a righteous happenstance."

Selection of beer was primarily Californian, with the exception of Maui brewing co. selection due to Singapore craft beer week. Cons: $sgd 14 beer during happy hour.Lack of attentiveness to customers; waited 10 minutes before finally giving in and asking for another beer. Not acceptable when there is four employees working and we are the only ones sitting at the bar. Staff was not knowledgable with the exception of maybe the owner.

I've found a few great craft beer places here so far, but none have matched the service we ultimately got at Tap last night (to be fair, I've not yet tried Smith Street, but it's on my list). The bartenders, especially Thomas, are laid-back but pretty attentive, full of expertise and great tips for beer choices, and happy to recommend local beer events, etc.I especially like that they cluster a handful of different beers from each of a handful of breweries rather than just a random assortment of single brews from all over the place; so, for Modern Times (San Diego), you can try their version of 4-5 different types of beer, from IPAs to stouts.Prices are high, but given the location, selection, and quality, that's a small price. Definitely going back, and I'd haunt them on the regular if I didn't live out near West Coast."

The people who work there were extremely friendly though, and tried to get me to wait for a bit for a seat, but I opted to get the takeout anyway.Admittedly, what attracted me there in the first place was their large sign for Laksa. I realize the danger in getting laksa in a place called Toast Box, but I was not disappointed. The laksa was creamy and flavourful, and they were not stingy on the ingredients. For $4.50, that's pretty incredible. I also really wanted to try the Kaya toast there, and for $1.40 - why not? And traditional milk tea for $1? Awesome.

It was so delicious and the dish was loaded with Crab, prawns, squid, beef and of course tofu. It also came with rice. I wish I could get more rice so I could eat more rice with the tofu.The variety of banchan here was very limited. My only complaint was: they really need to de-vein the prawns.SERVICE 5/5Service was great! A staff also gave each of us a complimentary pan-fried fish which I politely declined. I was slightly taken aback when  the staff placed the plate of fish with the head still intact in front of me  :/ I am sure the fish was good since everyone was happily enjoying them.AMBIANCE 4/5The SBCD at Millenia Walk was huge and spacious inside. This location is next to the Promenade Station.If one still has room for coffee or dessert, I highly recommend checking out Patisserie G or Kith Café inside Millenia Walk.

You can so imagine this cynical one rolling her eyes when she receive the invitation to taste the ""Best Peking Duck in Singapore"". BUT seriously, newly opened Kai Garden at Marina Square really lives up to that label. Consider me impressed with Chef-Owner and Executive Chef Fung Chi Keung's traditional Peking Duck when i tasted it. It was indeed the best that i've had. Chef Fung was previously from the Paradise Group, so you can be expecting a strong Cantonese cuisine at this 200-seater restaurant in Marina Square. So the glistening Peking Duck ($88/duck) is definitely the star here. The crispy skin was simply amazing (and i don't even really enjoy skin). The layer of fats under the naturally colored, browned crust simply renders beautifully in one's mouth. It doesn't taste too oily even.Accompanying the duck is an interesting selection of wraps- Original, Pumpkin, Green(Spinach), Bamboo Charcoal, and Beetroot.While the wraps didn't taste much of their stated ingredient, they added pretty colors, plus a great texture and balance to each bite. It's fairly thin, with just a light amount of chewiness, and it remained fairly moist even as the baskets made their rounds around the huge dining table. There are also 5 sauces that come with the dish (Duck, Black Pepper, Sesame, Seafood, or Special Mixed). Well i was happy with the regular sweet salty original duck sauce. The Double-boiled Japanese Matsutake served in Tea Pot ($38/pax) was stellar. The Matsutake is Japan's answer to the black truffle (it's very rare and unique) and it gave a sweet and earthy balance to the traditional Cantonese soup.Grouper in Lobster Soup (seasonal price) is a simple fish dish, flash cooked in a super umami Asian lobster bisque. It's rich without being too heavy. And the fish was given the TLC on the spot for that perfect doneness. I could have a whole pot of this easily. While i'm not exactly sure if serving crispy food on ice helps to maintain the crunchy texture, i enjoyed the Sweet and Sour Pork on The Rocks ($22/serving). I was afraid that the balls would be cold but thankfully they were warm still. The light crunch batter encased the juicy roughly minced pork and the sauce was balanced with the right amount of acidity and sweetness. Deep Fried Vegetarian Roll ($22) is a beautiful web of bamboo fungus that holds a juicy mix of vegetables and mushroom with tofu. The texture is amazing and the layers picked up the delicious pumpkin and chicken stock which was an intense reduction that i couldn't stop spooning. But other than that, the filling was pretty standard. If the bao skin were any indication the standard of their Kai Garden's dimsum, i would be here every weekend for brunch. Or supper if it's available every night. The Pan Fried Charcoal Pork Bun ($6.80 for 3pcs) is actually a xiao long bao in disguise. First the crisp crust, then the fluffy skin, and the juicy pork and broth in the center of it all. -slow clap- tears of joy- The meal concludes perfectly with the Chilled Fresh Coconut Puree ($6.80). This is such a great dessert! I would come back just for desserts alone. Kai Garden definitely has my vote for Best Peking Duck in town and I'm looking forward to sampling their Dimsum as well. For all you know, they may bag the Best Dimsum in Singapore title too."

My hubby had Carbonara which they agreed to replace the meat with chicken! It was the best carbonara he ever had in Singapore! We were very satisfied with our choices! For dessert, we had ordered Tiramisu which was very different to taste than what I have had my entire life, so this was something I didn't enjoy at all! It was very sweet of them to serve us complimentary dessert for our anniversary- a red velvet cake & it was amazing!

As we moved back to Europe there was no such thing as a Ruth's Chris Steak House and the restaurant became a story that my parents would tell us when we would talk about the best steak houses. While I planned my trip to Singapore with my family, I thought to myself, could it be that there is one in Singapore? I knew that they had opened one in Hong Kong and were opening a couple throughout Asia. To my surprise, I was right! In 2012 (I think) it had opened in Singapore. Without hesitation I made us a reservation. This place that I had heard so much about but couldn't remember from when I was small. I would discover it at last! Discover the steaks that melt on your tongue, the impeccable service, etc, etc... As our trip approached, I have to admit that I was becoming nervous. Could it really live up to those high standards I had put up in my head? Would I be inevitably disappointed?On the 3rd day of our stay in Singapore, the day had come. I will never forget walking in to the restaurant and being greeted by the Maitre D. Maybe it was because this place had become something so special to me that I thought it was the perfect restaurant and overall best dining experience of my life, but you can't deny that everything is simply perfect. From the steak to the service to the wine and even to the beautiful decor! Everything was just as I had imagined it. I don't want to spoil the experience as it is something everyone should see for themselves. Myself and my mother had the NY strip, my dad had the Rib-eye. I would recommend both of these options but it really depends on personal preference. A glass of red wine is a must for me and I would definitely suggest to take the ""Roasted Brussels Sprouts"" or ""Lobster Mac And Cheese"" for sides. I can't recommend this place enough! Yes, the prices are high but you won't be disappointed! I don't know when I will return to a Ruth's Chris Steak House the next time as I live in London but I am already looking forward to it."

Some steaks will be cold by the time u're halfway through it. I've had the 340g & 450g usda rib eyes and each bite was beefy, tender, juicy & flavourful. The mac & cheese has a crunchy crispy topping that seperates it from the usual mac & cheese. Dessert portions are large but they are also very tasty.

So he decided to prove me wrong and drag my brother and I to the place.. and the first thing I noticed was.. it's not Chris Ruth.. it's called Ruth's Chris. Secondly, it turned out to be quite a dressy place.. which I, in my jeans and tee-shirt, feel a little bit out of sorts.. as the location of this place is within the hotel. Thankfully, the waiters were kind enough to not judge. We ordered a variety of dishes, Caesar Salad (delicious), lambchops (not bad), roast potatoes and mashed potatoes side dish (I am addicted to their roast potatoes, a must try!) and of course, their steak. We had 3 plates of it.. in medium well. Firstly, the steak was served on a sizzling white plate. Yes, you heard me right, it was served on a ceramic white plate that is hot. That was interesting. Secondly, the color of the steak.. perfectly grilled. When we cut it, it was exactly like what we asked for. Medium well. Not too tough, not too bloody. Just nice. Thirdly, it tasted lovely, even without any condiments. So my dad was right, Ruth's Chris's steaks are good! The ambience of the place is akin to that of Lawry's sans the french maids prancing about with trolleys doing their twinkly dance with the spinning salad bowl. It's quiet, a good place to have a good chat with friends or your significant other. As the place is quite pricey, it is a good place to go to for a special occasion. I must say this place is definitely one of my to go places for steak in future. Do give it a try if you have the money or if you are simply craving for a good steak."

The food was faultless, and I loved the traditional style of Ruth's Chris' steaks; unadorned save for salt, pepper, and a simple glaze of American butter. No sauces, herbs or seasoning to distract from the meat, so the quality of the meat is highlighted in its pure form, which I understand can be a little uninspiring for some diners. But one man's meat is another man's poison, so what's boring to others can also be construed as classic, and I like my stuff classic anyway.Service was gracious, if a bit spotty (our water glasses weren't refilled automatically).All in all, this is definitely going down as one of 2016's best eats. We had:1) New Orleans-styled Barbecued Shrimp ($35): a must-try, we actually ordered more bread to mop up that lovely spiced garlicky white wine and butter sauce.2) USDA Prime Ribeye ($85 for 12-ounce): a perfect medium-well. The corn-fed meat had ample heft, and imbued with a tantalizing char. Be sure to go down a cooked-level coz it'll continue cooking at the table3) USDA New York Strip ($85 for 12-ounce): fuller-bodied flavour than the ribeye, but just as sumptuous and robust.4) USDA Filet ($90 for 11-ounce): a leaner cut but incredibly tender and luscious.There are a good number of sides to break up the monotony of steak, and we liked:5) Sauteed Spinach ($20): clean, delicate, and simply fried with garlic.6) Potato Au Gratin ($20): laden with cream and burnished with cheddar melt. Rustic, old-school and hearty"

What's special about this place is that there is an appetizer buffet as long as you order any set meal. (Actually everything on the menu is a set meal). Top up a little more to get free flow drinks. The appetizer buffet was better than I expected. Consisting of some vegetables, sweet potatoes, chawanmushi, and even soba! It will give you enough taste-utility of a Japanese meal even with not-too-big a price tag. I ordered a curry pork katsu rice and my partner ordered a beef suki yaki. The former serves a good size junky juicy piece of pork with a nice blend of curry sauce that has the slight mix of Indian curry that I've never tasted in a Japanese curry. The result, is good. The latter is a sweet soup with enough beef to make you finish your rice before you can finish the beef. Pictures speaks better than words and their concept of having a appetizer buffet seems to be paying off with consumers as you see a decent queue outside. All prices here are ++."

What I really enjoy is the the QQ of the noodles, that are very springy, and the seasoning of the dish as a whole, makes the noodles tasty by itself. Throw in the minced pork, char siwe and abalone, and the dish is completed. The trick is to have the noodles dry, not soup as it will affect the taste. While I enjoy the noodles, the portions here tend to be on the small side, so paying $10 for a bowl of noodles that doesn't really fill me up, doesn't make a lot of sense. Nonetheless, when the craving for Kolo Mee strikes, I'll definitely find myself here!"

Not only are there a TON of Japanese patrons during the weekday lunch hour, but if seated inside, more likely or not you'll have to take your shoes off to dine.I frequent Japanese restaurants, at least once or twice a week. Despite this, I could not recognize any of the dishes on the menu. These dishes are truly different. The big draw at this restaurant is the weekly rotating lunch set at $9++. On the day I went, I had a beautifully marinated fish served (teriyaki I believe) with an Ox tongue/Wintery miso soup and daikon radish soup and nutty barley rice. Like, I said it's DIFFERENT.If you are adventurous and go in with an open mind, this is the Japanese restaurant to go to. I guess that's what makes this restaurant a truly AUTHENTIC FIND!"

The beef bone ramen tastes very much like a Chinese noodle soup with a Japanese twist. Wouldn't say it's bad either, just that the standard has dropped. Even the side dishes for the additional $8 set, are now cold and smaller in portion as if it was been left outside for some time. Chawanmushi had a funny taste to it too. Ordered a Saba mackerel fish as well, ain't warm, pretty cold and oil tasted bitter. Fish was chewy and unfresh. Was pretty disappointed as i've always had high regards for this restaurant especially for its authenticity. Maybe the Chef has changed? Also, it took really Long for the order to arrive (20 mins for a simple mackerel set dish without rice), and when it did, they weren't warm. Had difficulty calling out to the waitresses (several times) which was very unlike the crew in the past, they were very efficient. Pity the restaurant's overall standard has dropped a great deal."

Not only they looked esthetically pleasing, they tasted good too. I just had a cake named ""Poison Apple"". It looked like an apple. It was so pretty.

I hope the seven dwarves would appear if I fell on the floor, and my prince would eventually show up. Right!! ;P Anyhoo, this ""Poison Apple"" tasted good, inside was a mix of cake and the center reminded me of apple pie. The other cake I had tried recently was the Lychee Rose Cheesecake.

They get the small things right and that's what keeps me coming back. Decor is in light, natural wood colors. Relaxed music in the background. Polite service. Water and newspaper for your free taking and reading. Perfect setup to chill, relax, grab a bite with a friend or colleague. They manage to keep it simple when it comes to the menu. For savory, eggs cocotte/scrambled and gourmet sandwiches. All of 7 sandwiches to choose from. Not a problem as they make them very well. My fav is the Parma ham, mushroom relish, arugula and Gruyere. Accompanied with crisps. Yummy to the last bite. Not a big connoisseur of coffee. I only know when it tastes good. And to me this is good, especially with the desserts they have. Again, not a mind boggling vast selection but what they make, they make well. My only sticking point these days is that it gets pricey to have these types of lovely dining experiences. Fine if you make oodles of dough but for many it's out of reach. =(Very much recommended!"

I was torn between Kith next door and Patisserie G. Both were just as crowded so I looked at the cakes they had on display. Kith's cakes were larger and richer, and i felt I wasn't really that hungry. So I chose Patisserie G. The cakes were smaller, but had this artisinal look to them. The apple crumble and cappuccino I ordered were pretty good. I wish they offered me the option of having a warm Apple crumble though. The cappuccino was delightful. Nice foam and a nutty aftertaste. Would come here again if I'm around the area again."

It's an ultra modern French cafe that plays feel good songs. Coffee and Pastries are definitely their strong suit. Their coffee selections are extensive ranging from: double expresso, to double macchiato to Cappuccino and Flat white. I understand they source all their coffee beans from local artisan roasters, liberty coffee. I would say Patisserie G's coffee edges out it's neighbor Commune upstairs. I find the cappuccino here tastier, the latte art more detailed, and the coffee having more of a subtle finish (which I prefer).The pastries, albeit on the expensive side, are Classic French favorites: macaroons, cheese cakes, chocolate mousse, lemon cakes, strawberry cakes, etc. I'm not a Pastry expert so I won't elaborate more than I have to, but they are of very high quality, among the highest on the red dot, especially among those offered to the regular consumer outside of high prices restaurant establishments.Overall, I'm a big fan of Patisserie G. However, I will ding this pastry shop one-star for removing ""Everyone Loves Us Yelp"" sticker. This is a very special accolade that few local establishments get globally. Yes, some yelpers may give tough reviews, but overall the Yelp Community in SG are huge fans of Patisserie G, especially me."

The chocolate sea salt cookies are an exact match to the Pierre Herme chocolate sea salt cookies - decadently chocolatey with the zing of salt to keep things happening. They also do a lovely crumbly buttery salted egg yolk cookie for Chinese New Year. The chocolate eclair is also very decent - some places have their eclairs sitting in the display cases slowly drying into cardboard crumbliness. But Patisserie G's eclair is fresh enough that the choux has a crisp shell and light interior. Helps too that the cream filling is usually richly flavoured. They've done well enough over the years to expand to additional seating outside the shop. I love their morning breakfast offerings - croque monsieur, buttery croissants and lightly brewed coffee.  Good place to hang out, chill over a cuppa and a nicely made sweet."

Gone was my favourite Douceur. Along the way, we had the Eggs En Cocotte with Bacon ($16), a French dish that hasn't seem to rise to much popularity for brunch in Singapore yet. The savoury custard was well-seasoned and wiggly, speedily demolished with the soldiers of fragrant toasted brioche. Meantime, the Creamy Scramble Eggs ($15/add on with smoked salmon $3) might not be as grandiose as the soft luscious yellow clouds served at Bills, but was a heart-warming delight to go with its reputable croissant. Yes, I've had it previously with my dark chocolate drink and it still stays VERY delicious. The Lemon Cheesecake ($9) exhibits great character, distinguishing itself from the usual baked cheesecake with a livid lemon curd in the centre and a reliable chocolate biscuit base instead of the occasionally cranky graham crust. The Hazelnut Opera ($8.50) was particularly iffy; unquestionably tri-textures of the hazelnut ganache, coffee sponge and chocolate ganache, but the hazelnut tones weren't pronounced. The Nouvelle G ($9), a 73%-63% dark chocolate spaceship lookalike that had a delicate sandy yet crispy chocolate feuilletine which was finer than any of the feuilletine here. But the star was the Coconut Choux Tart ($9), a pretty revolutionary piece that focused on the coconut-flavoured Carribean rum. Nothing much to speak in terms of coconut accents, but the beloved textures of all the components; chantily cream, (empty) choux puff, salted caramel sauce and Creme brûlée custard tart is enough to make this gateaux a highly saleable one."

Ms Gwen Lim identifies her target consumers as ""a niche group of people who understand French pastry and are discerning about good-quality French products"", namely the ""well-travelled"" Singaporean. Mm not the humblest way to plug her pâtisserie, but must say she really knows how to appeal to the yuppie psyche.Lemon Cheesecake, $9.00 - One forkful of the cheesecake should be enough to convince you that these cakes are worth good money. The filling is zesty and creamy without being too heavy on the palate, and flecked with crushed vanilla beans. The biscuit crust is actually crispy (!!) and tastes slightly singed, but went pretty well with the citrus filling and the strip of candied lemon peel. There's this thin gelatinous cover on the cake which I find odd, but its mostly tasteless and adds glossiness to the cake so meh, I'll live with it.Triomphe, $8.50 - Named after a historical monument, the Triomphe sported a lustrous toffee-brown coat that made it resemble a giant piece of Werther's candy. This baby was calling out my name so I decided I had to eat him. The caramel mousse was malty, ever-so-slightly burnt and, to sum it up: just divine. Within the cake there are a couple layers of soft hazelnut sponge, but the mousse was the friggin' star of the show. If it were up to me, I'd add a praline base or something crunchy at the bottom to provide some contrast in texture, but I'm sure the chef is better than I am at knowing which ingredients go together. In any case, the magical mousse is reason enough to justify repeated visits to Patisserie G.Flat White, $5.50 - The coffee selection here is proof that Patisserie G isn't going to bend over backwards for pedestrian crowds. Our respective requests for a mocha and a skinny latte were met with an apologetic ""We don't do those here."" from the waitress taking our orders at the counter. Embarrassed by my wimpyness, I manned up and got a flat white. Patisserie G gets its blends from artisan roasters Liberty Coffee (specifically the Speakeasy brew), which should please coffee aficionados. My flat white was nutty and robust.I watched in slack-jawed wonder as one of the baristas artfully crafted the smiling face of a bear on another customer's latte, then scowled in displeasure at the very unelaborate heart on the surface of my flat white. I'll be back, and I'll be sure to request for a bear on my coffee."

We were showed to a roomy booth table, where the staff pulled out the table for us to be seated. Looked through the menu, we decided on the 3-course Sunday Lunch Set Menu (S$98++).After placing order, we were served its signature Onion Bread and butter. The huge bun was pipping hot and fluffy.For AppetizerBaked Five Onion Soup (ala carte price S$29++)It was served in a small cup with melted cheese toast on top. The soup was more salty side but great to dip the bread with.Chopped House Salad (ala carte price S$28++)It may not looked much, but the flavours were great. Just take of note of the strong flavoured goat cheese.For Entree8.5oz Filet Mignon with Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes (ala carte price S$101++/ 8oz)Went with the staff's recommendation of medium rare. Opt to serve with mustard and brown sauce, plus sour cream for the mash on the side. The meat was done just right without too raw or too tough. The mash was delicious with bits of potato in it.Center-Cut Prime Ribeye (Topup S$30++) (ala carte price S$118++/ 16oz)Went with the staff's recommendation of medium. The meat serving was double of the filet mignon.  Opt to serve with brown sauce, plus sour cream for the mash on the side. The meat was done just right without too raw or too tough. The texture was smoother compared to the filet mignon, but the serving was too huge for a female like me. The end part was a tab too chewy than preferred.For DessertMorton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake (Topup S$10++) (ala carte price S$36++)The molten chocolate cake was served hot, topped with raspberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream by the side. Soft crumbling crust, encasing the hot molten chocolate inside. Sinfully rich pairing with the cold ice cream.Key Lime Pie (ala carte price S$26++)Served with a slice of lime and a pile of whipped cream.I was too full to have a mouth of it. The staff kindly packed it up for takeaway."

The steaks and seafood are just on point, they are perfectly cooked and of very good quality.The cocktails are also comparable to those in the US, unlike in most Singaporean bars & restaurants it is not a watered down jobbie, it is a full strength Martini. The wine we had was excellent (but $$$!).Another nice touch is that they had (like in the US) the menu personalized and offered a complimentary souffle plus a printed out picture for me to take home. In general, the service was very good throughout the night.Morton's complimented the great company of my friends perfectly, I felt so spoiled and happy. The only downside was the price: it is certainly not cheap and is still more expensive than their US counterparts but it is well worth it in my opinion. Will go back if another special occassion comes up."

Morton's bar happy hour every evening from 5pm - 7pm, with free flow steak sliders with any drinks purchased, and selected martinis at $15.95.I ordered a chocolate mortini and the big boy for himself a cosmopolitan. The chocolate mortini taste fabulous with a thick layer of chocolate which settles at the bottom of the martini glass. We also helped ourselves with a couple of steak sliders (2 mouthfuls worth) which are so succulent and good!We moved on to dinner at the restaurant.We love the setting and service of the restaurant, private yet intimate, and dark romantic and comfortable set up. We had sufficient introduction and great service from the staff who made us feel comfortable throughout our whole dining experience.We ordered a chilled Morton's Prime Ocean Platter, a 12oz centre cut filet mignon (add enhancement of a slab of black truffle butter), and button mushroom only (as recommended by the waitress) for sharing. The sweet gesture by the chef, separate the 12oz filet mignon to 2 equal portions for us. (Look at it on a cost saving perspective..)Received a complimentary small soufflé for the birthday boy, and a lovely birthday song by the staff. To sum up the night, the staff helped us take and developed a photo for souvenir.Concluded that Morton's is not only known for its steak, the ocean platter is also fresh and worth the mention! Steak is perfectly medium rare by the chef, and it should not go without a good glass of red wine.We had a great dining experience with good food, drinks and service at the restaurant and will definitely pop by again in future!"

Their price tag is also equally legendary.Excited yet apprehensive about the quality of the steak and the size of the hole it will burn in my pocket, I accepted my partner's invitation to have dinner with him at Morton's.A few things sorely lacking in most F&B establishments in Singapore is the quality of service provided. At Morton's, you can expect the best, personalised service ever (Well, comparable to Black Swan, I would say).Stepping foot into Mandarin Oriental (Morton's is at Level 4), I gave 2 thumbs up to the antiquated-like settings with deep maroon and brass finishing. Somehow in my mind's eye, I always have this vision that good steakhouses will have these kind of furnishings. Anyway, I digress.The two waitresses greeted me with a warm smile and without hesitation I mentioned that my friend is already inside. To which, they confirmed my friend's name and one of them walked me to my table. The self-independent woman in me wanted to decline for her to walk me to my table but she was walking too purposefully for me to stop her. I spotted my partner in one the booths and he gave me a mischievous smile. We reached the table and next thing I knew, the waitress pull out the table with effortless Herculean strength to let me in. Wow. I guess this is part of their service to diners who sit at the booths which I feel was adequate for one person to slide in, slowly.Having checked out their menu online, I was still undecided on what to order so we decided to seek the recommendations of our waiter. He gamely and cheerfully recommended me a Center-Cut Fillet Mignon 8oz as he felt that the 12oz onwards would be too huge for me - if only he knew of my appetite for beef, having ate 2 Jack's Place steak in one sitting! For my partner, he recommended the Chilean Seabass Fillet a La Nage. We ordered the cream spinach after our waiter commented that the sauteed spinach and mushrooms are meh.The crowd was picking up by that time and I was impressed when our food came in record time. Verdict:1. Center-Cut Fillet Mignon - I was singing praises with every gentle slice of beef that I savoured - ""Wow, very soft, melts in your mouth. This is good."" - to the point my partner was highly amused. The 8oz would be more than sufficient to most ladies, but not to me. Almost to the point where I was tempted to order another one! Served simply on a white plate, the steak oozed flavourful spoonfuls of beef juice!2. Creamed Spinach -  The dish looks overwhelming at first sight but it goes well with my steak as I had no sides on my plate. The delicious butter-filled aroma that it exudes is simply appetizing. Though it is 'creamed', it is light and easy on the palette.3. Chilean Seabass Fillet a La Nage -  Fresh, that's one word to describe the fish. The portion is somewhat larger then what most steakhouses would serve but we are not complaining. The sauce may seem a bit too light for those who are used to creamy, buttery sauce but I feel that it acts as an excellent foil to bring out the freshness of the fish. 4. Key Lime Pie - This tops my list as the best ever, dethroning the Key Lime Pie at PS Cafe. Light and tangy with just the right amount of sweetness, this is a good choice for a desert. Best savoured with after-dinner tea (without milk).The manager stopped by our table to chat and check on our satisfaction and though I usually dislike chatting with the staff during my meal, I was infected by his good sense of humor and charm.Would I return again? Hell, yes! On special occasions though..Service: 5/5Humor of staff 6/5Food: 5/5Price: 3/5 (only because it would burn a huge hole in your pocket if you start craving for the Fillet Mignon 8oz every two weeks!)"

Free steak sarnies too from 5-7pm. You know how a medium rare steak is so juicy? A slice of that is sandwiched by two soft buns and slathered in a horseradish cream. Oh so gooood!!! The chocotinis are the best in town too. Those steak sandwiches and one cocktail will fill you up too. Writing this review just makes me wish for Monday happy hour to come :p

The sommelier was great and recommended a Ruffino Chianti that was medium bodied and paired well with the fillet. That said, the rest of the dinner was very disappointing. The steamed asparagus was flavorless, as was the Hollandaise sauce which accompanied it. When we asked what type of cheese was in the au gratin potatoes (we adore smoked Gouda), we were told ""American,""  which is not a real cheese, but a processed cheese ""food.""  We ordered the filet mignon done ""medium"" and it was beautifully tender, but sadly underdone. As it was Valentines Day, and our anniversary, we were told that we would be receiving a dessert ""on the house.""  Instead of a traditional chocolate dessert, we were presented with a ""lemon soufflé.""

Furthermore they were quite detailed with little actions well taken care of and make us felt close to heart.We were presented with a hand decorated birthday card with our photo instantly printed which was a pleasant surprise to the birthday guy, making the event a memorable one in Morton's !Overall, everything was good.

The food is still good and service is very good by Singapore standards, but perhaps not as good as before since Lawry's took over. Had lunch recently during a conference, which may or may not explain our experience. Even with a very full house, we got hot cups of lobster bisque and good bread (though we had to ask for it). Our sirloin steaks came at the right doneness but everyone had quite different sized cuts, which is strange for a restaurant that I used to think was very consistent. I would also have liked a bit more charring on my steak but that tends to be done best on a filet mignon. We had cheesecakes for dessert and as always, there were no complaints there.I am willing to give Morton's the benefit of doubt as this restaurant has historically been a great experience at dinner. Will be back sometime to see if things have really changed."

We tried the molten chocolate cake as well which was pretty normal, not really glorious or anything was hoping for the wow factor.One thing that we should not have tried is the Caesar salad, with only grated parmesan cheese and croutons on it and really over priced.

The better being the aforementioned pro arguments: I never had bad service here, I never had bad food here and I find the prices to be reasonable for a good steak. The negative part of any larger scale chain restaurant is that it is generic, not outside the box.

The complimentary onion bread is quite something, I can never have enough of it. But you must leave space for the crab cake. We usually order it to share (begrudgingly) but if budget is not an issue, do yourself a favour and have one on your own. I listen obligatorily to the server's repertoire as they roll the meat cart around, explaining and pointing to the various cuts in a well-rehearsed manner, and managing to stifle a giggle when they pick up the lobster with its claws flailing about. However, when it comes to the steak selection, I only have eyes for the marbled US aged black angus ribeye ($97, moderately huge, we ordered one to split).   Morton's always gets medium exactly right, so no ribeyes of mine ever go to waste, and the marbling means I get delicious melting fat to go along with well-seared, pink-in-the-middle king of all steaks. Add a side of asparagus if you must have your vegetables.Looking for an excuse to go back again! Reservations are a must."

The grilled squid was previously frozen before getting tossed on the grill, and was rather chewy. The udon was generally run of the mill.

Well, this article stated that Tomo Izakaya had $5 beers and cheap Japanese eats. It was pretty much a must visit after reading about $5 beers. Finding this place was easy. It's close to the Esplanade, and in a great part of town, close to the river with a great view of Marina Bay and the CBD. We took a seat and really enjoyed their décor and setting. We ordered a couple of $5 Japanese beers and few bites which included 1) bacon scallop skewers 2) cold soba noodles 3) sushi roll 4) Seafood salad 5) chicken karage.

Izakaya Tomo serves Japanese cuisine, and I'd say that you will have to try their grilled food items when you get here. We ordered the soft shell crab maki, unagi maki, bacon-wrapped vegetables, grilled squid, grilled beef, and grilled mackerel - we ended up paying about $23 per person in a party of four.Izakaya's unagi maki takes the prize, hands down. The unagi simply melts in your mouth as you bite through the firm and fresh rice ball to reach the center. The unagi is also not overly oily or slimy, so those worried about that will have less reason to hesitate ordering this dish. The soft shell crab is crispy and relatively salty (as should be expected), but not remarkable. I also wondered how difficult it would be to ruin bacon-wrapped vegetables: in any case, I loved Izakaya's version. The bacon fats are grilled nicely, with pepper bits decorating the meat at the surface.The grilled squid was a little tough and could have spent more time in the heat, but I had nothing to complain about the mackerel: thin-crisp skin combined with the succulent white flesh of the fish, tinged with freshly-squeezed lemon zest. You also can taste the smoked flavours as you savour every bite. The grilled beef - my friends concurred - was done just right: sinewy but not tough, with the temperature wavering between medium-rare and medium.Ultimately, I'd say they do their grilled food very well; and the ambience is unbeatable. The cool breeze from the waters nearby, live music in the distance, and open space so that you don't need to compete for elbow room while dining."

The location makes for quiet dining (sorta) with a slightly more sophisticated crowd and relaxing ambience. Gyu Tataki ($13) is the beef version of sashimi. Lightly seared on the outside then marinated with lemon, vinegar and soy sauce after, it was served with pounded ginger and spring onions on top of the rare meat. Very big slices of beef which really worked our jaws. There is none of that bloodiness or heaviness of the red meat. Oishi.Skewers were next. Who could say no to BBQ bacon wrapped anything? The smokiness of the fatty pork flavored the succulent and sweet hotate chunks ($10), giving each bite a burst of juices and flavors.Shitake Mentai Cheese ($7) is a must order. The woody and juicy shitake goes perfectly with the crackling bacon and the mentaiko cream was simply the icing on the cake.The Tonkujyou Chirashi ($36) is really the highlight of the meal. The special chirashi is worth every bit of that 36 bucks even though it's a small bowl. Tomo is very generous with the fresh sashimi. The fatty toro was creamy with fats and extremely well marbled. There was so much uni and salmon roe to go around that we had to finish all the vinegar rice (which was delicious on its own too). One of the best chirashi bowls in town and reasonably priced.For reviews and more, visit my blog."

Eventually I surrendered and fell back on my familiar grounds, Millenia Walk.I have a friend who kept suggesting we meet at Uma Uma but somehow we made it to everywhere else except here. So I thought why don't I try it here even w/o her.SERVICE 5/5Staff greeted me upon entering and basically let me choose whichever table I like. That was wonderful. No problem with the service! FOOD 5/5Uma Uma Ramen (without the spicy miso) - An excellent Tonkotsu ramen!! Egg was perfectly cooked to what it should be. The broth was thick. So I read, Uma Uma serves the Hakata-styled ramen and It was established in Fukuoka in 1953.The Chicken kaarage was one of the best I tasted in recent times and I had a lot of chicken kaarage.So what made me took out one point? Read further...AMBIENCE 4/5The décor reminded me of a Izakaya. I really love the ambience. However, that chair I was sitting on was the devil. It was really uncomfortable and not long after the meal, my back was hurting :( Despite of that, I would still come to Uma Uma noodles if I get the chance."

It looked quite colorful with the different toppings on top. Remember to toss the dish before eating. Felt that it was quite difficult to toss as the shredded vegetables tended to stick together. It was a cold and refreshing dish. The top potion was a bit dry and flavourful, whereas the bottom was quite flavourful with strong sesame oil taste as the dressing was quite watery and tended to stay at the bottom.Overall the food was not bad but the choices was quite limited during the day. More choices as yakitori and cocktails were available at night. Service was not bad with iced water refilled regularly."

There was a national day set promotion which seemed quite value for money. A normal ramen alone costs $15++ at the minimum while the promotion had a ramen, char siu bun, green tea ice cream with red beans and green tea for $20++. I had the prawn ramen which reminded me of prawn bisque. The soup was more like gravy but the thick flavor more than compensated for it. The char siu bun had small dried shrimps which was a nice surprise. When we paid, the waitress even asked if we liked the food. Overall positive experience in terms of the taste and service!"

Here, we kicked back with grilled Yakitori and Kushikatsu,  cocktails and drinks by Horse's Mouth and Hakata-styled ramen from Uma Uma Ramen.It really felt like we walked into a Hakata izakaya at Uma Uma, with its slightly crampish seating, long bar/ramen counter and warm Japanese hospitality. Orders were placed swiftly, so that the a la minute sticks with homemade sauces (created by Head Chef, Shota Kaneko) would arrive quickly.  Ingredients are imported twice weekly from Japan and the quality is best presented through grilling. My favorite Yakitori sticks are the Tsukune (chicken balls with soft bone) which was juicy with some crunch! All resolve to eat healthy will obliterate with a stick (or 2) of that crispy and sweet grilled chicken skin! How did i resist this for so long?! The Butabura (Pork Belly) and chicken thigh were a tad dry-ish and bland for my liking. And obviously I'm not a fan the bland soft bone. All Yakitori sticks are priced between $2 - 3 each.From the bar bites, do not miss the fried Brussels Sprouts ($10) with a salty sweet sauce. This is possibly the 'healthiest' dish at Uma Uma. Loved those browned crispy edges. The Eihire (stingray fins) ($10) are best eaten hot. They tastes exactly like grilled cuttlefish but sweeter.The Kushikatsu (串揚げ) selection is quite small currently. While the batter is sufficiently light and not overly greasy, I always felt it's a waste of the ingredients when they are deep fried. Wouldn't the freshly imported Japan scallops have died in vain? Well thankfully they remained fairly decent after frying. I much preferred the Pork Loin with the Tonkatsu sauce though I must say it's a bit tougher. All Kushikatsu sticks are sold from $2 - 5 each.Now this is the star of Uma Uma actually- the Chasiu Don ($5) with an additional Onsen Tamago ($1.50). Love love love the wonderfully charred and buttery chasiu with soy! This portion is perfect for the ladies and for the guys too, since you could always have other sides to go with! This is also available at the other outlets, even at Horse's Mouth (it's $10 there though).For something heartier to go with the meat skewers, pick from the list of ramen. I'd go with the Mazesoba, a Japanese spin on the local dry ba chor mee (minced pork noodles). They use a Hokkaido type of curly yellow noodles (which was a bit too alkaline IMO) topped with spring onions, bamboo shoots, leeks, chili oil and onsen egg. You should definitely top up or add on a side of the wonderfully charred chasiu! I found the Uma Uma Ramen ($14) to be too bland, oily, and overcooked for my liking. The Bushi Tonkotsu Ramen ($16) fared better with the smoky bonito flakes Tonkotsu soup but that's my preference. The good guys behind Horse's Mouth have crafted a special drinks menu for Uma Uma, featuring Sakes chosen from small and private breweries in Japan, classic cocktails, premium whiskys and beers so there is something for everyone."

Definitely enjoyed thiss!! Portion wise it was very generous and easily made the three of us full.- HALIA CHILLI CRAB SPAGHETTI: One of their signature dishesss and it was absolutely delicious! At first I was worried that the sauce would be too heavy but it wasn't at all. And they certainly didn't skimp on the crab bits!!- HALIBUT EN PAPILLOTE: Another signature dish which I really enjoyed! My favorite was the buttery soup-like sauce the halibut, broccoli, and mushrooms were soaked in. It definitely helped add some flavor to the unseasoned halibut. The dish also is accompanied with aioli sauce for you to dip the halibut in!!

Afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room is one thing but ladies of leisure still need their morning coffee run and eggs of course! And what better place to do it than at the urban, casual-chic sister of the award winning restaurant. I much preferred the indoor space which has a bit more privacy as compared to the alfresco bar area. Plus the Singapore weather is not meant for dining outdoors, even with ceiling fans. Give me my ac please.Weekend brunch starts at 11am. The selection is extensive with both the Brunch Specials and the Main Menu available for the picking. I've been in quite a bread mood recently and the Assorted Bread & Pastries ($12) really appealed to the tummy. The croissant was delightful and i love that they serve clotted cream with the basket.The Pancake with bacon, maple butter, fresh strawberries & puree ($12) was one of my favorite dish. I always get overwhelmed after eating a piece of pancake but Halia's rendition had me going on and on. I like the slightly buttery batter which was fluffy and the thin flaky bacon was an interesting complement to the dish. If you're more the traditional English Breakfast sort, you'd do well with the Grilled breakfast with any style eggs ($23). What's interesting was the sweetened bacon which was thick and juicy. The scrambled eggs had this interesting layered texture and i like that it was runny but not too creamy. I'm getting hooked on buttery eggs.  I'm not so much of a fan of the White bean Iberico chorizo leek stew ($16) but if you like gumbo and the starchiness of such a stew for brunch, then this would be it. The stew was  rich and starchy with a tinge of sourness from the smoked chipotle sauce. The Celeriac ""Lasagna"" ($12) is an interesting signature with crunchy thin sheets of pasta. I thought i was munching on vegetables. This was accompanied with mushrooms, thyme, baby spinach, lemon and Madeira cream. Another signature is the Halia Chili Crab Spaghettini ($25). Piquant spicy finish that is typically Asian. The flavor of ginger was rather strong but it gave the dish a fresh note. I could also taste the sweetness of the crab meat. If only they would use a thicker pasta. The Sous Vide Baharat Chicken Leg ($28) was very tender and flavorful. It also had that smoky taste which was well complemented with the sweet butternut squash puree. I was intrigued by the crispy thin skin which had the texture of a baked potato skin. Served with a ginger, coriander and pepper salsa. I like how Halia caters to vegetarian eaters with their innovative dishes.

Definitely enjoyed thiss!! Portion wise it was very generous and easily made the three of us full.- HALIA CHILLI CRAB SPAGHETTI: One of their signature dishesss and it was absolutely delicious! At first I was worried that the sauce would be too heavy but it wasn't at all. And they certainly didn't skimp on the crab bits!!- HALIBUT EN PAPILLOTE: Another signature dish which I really enjoyed! My favorite was the buttery soup-like sauce the halibut, broccoli, and mushrooms were soaked in. It definitely helped add some flavor to the unseasoned halibut. The dish also is accompanied with aioli sauce for you to dip the halibut in!!

Afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room is one thing but ladies of leisure still need their morning coffee run and eggs of course! And what better place to do it than at the urban, casual-chic sister of the award winning restaurant. I much preferred the indoor space which has a bit more privacy as compared to the alfresco bar area. Plus the Singapore weather is not meant for dining outdoors, even with ceiling fans. Give me my ac please.Weekend brunch starts at 11am. The selection is extensive with both the Brunch Specials and the Main Menu available for the picking. I've been in quite a bread mood recently and the Assorted Bread & Pastries ($12) really appealed to the tummy. The croissant was delightful and i love that they serve clotted cream with the basket.The Pancake with bacon, maple butter, fresh strawberries & puree ($12) was one of my favorite dish. I always get overwhelmed after eating a piece of pancake but Halia's rendition had me going on and on. I like the slightly buttery batter which was fluffy and the thin flaky bacon was an interesting complement to the dish. If you're more the traditional English Breakfast sort, you'd do well with the Grilled breakfast with any style eggs ($23). What's interesting was the sweetened bacon which was thick and juicy. The scrambled eggs had this interesting layered texture and i like that it was runny but not too creamy. I'm getting hooked on buttery eggs.  I'm not so much of a fan of the White bean Iberico chorizo leek stew ($16) but if you like gumbo and the starchiness of such a stew for brunch, then this would be it. The stew was  rich and starchy with a tinge of sourness from the smoked chipotle sauce. The Celeriac ""Lasagna"" ($12) is an interesting signature with crunchy thin sheets of pasta. I thought i was munching on vegetables. This was accompanied with mushrooms, thyme, baby spinach, lemon and Madeira cream. Another signature is the Halia Chili Crab Spaghettini ($25). Piquant spicy finish that is typically Asian. The flavor of ginger was rather strong but it gave the dish a fresh note. I could also taste the sweetness of the crab meat. If only they would use a thicker pasta. The Sous Vide Baharat Chicken Leg ($28) was very tender and flavorful. It also had that smoky taste which was well complemented with the sweet butternut squash puree. I was intrigued by the crispy thin skin which had the texture of a baked potato skin. Served with a ginger, coriander and pepper salsa. I like how Halia caters to vegetarian eaters with their innovative dishes. The Mushroom, Lentil & Walnut Bake ($24) was absolutely delicious and even this meat eater was sold. It was nutty, cheesy, savory and sweet with the fennel seed cream and sun dried tomato. I would order this again.As you can tell, the Halia offers a wide variety for brunch and i found it quite perfect for group gatherings. Enjoy!"

Making me so hungry right now.The roast meats are absolutely delightful too, though I felt portions were a bit tiny, probably so we could try more things. Consistently good, would return, and starve myself before I come here again!"

The plainest most boring looking dish was the congee and it was really good.  I fancy myself a bit of a congee connoisseur having eaten it in many countries/cities and the congee here ranks in the 25 percentile or so. From there it's kind of all downhill.  Not to say they were bad but the rest of the dishes were kinda like meh... I could have had like 3 dishes for the price of 1 back in LA and it'd be around as good.  Overall it's a good restaurant and a nice high end experience (if not a bit rushed)... but in a city with so many options it's hard to recommend."

Excellent dim sum buffet in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. This is the buffet type where you sit and order from a menu and they serve you (as opposed to having a buffet line). Not cheap at S$68/pax but I think it's good value for money given the quality of ingredients. You could order dim sum, cooked dishes as well as dessert (all included).We find the cooked dishes standard good like what you would expect from an upscale Chinese restaurant but the dim sum were excellent, in particular the Kurobuta char siew pao and siew mai. Desserts were ok."

It literally combines the two best things together: dim sum and buffet. Hubby was so excited for it and we even arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened for trading. We went for the first seating that started at 11 AM.The restaurant was quite grandeur and calm at the same time. The dark wooden furniture gave a very classy feel to the whole restaurant. Hubby and I were used to the bustling dim sum carts and noisy tables. I think it was quite calm because there were only a few people that morning. We quite enjoyed the warm and luxurious atmosphere at Cherry Garden. Yes, there wasn't any dim sum carts rolling around the place that morning. We ordered what we wanted off the buffet menu through the friendly staff. Our tea pot always got refilled promptly by them too. The menu also consists of soup & appetisers, desserts and other hot Chinese dishes (rice, congee, noodles, seafood, meat, vegetables).We started off with something light so we ordered the rice congee and a serving of hot and sour soup. The rice congee came with the century egg and shredded pork while the hot and sour soup contained a good amount of seafood in it. Both items look small in the photo but the size of the serving bowl was actually really good. We really enjoyed our deep fried Chinese-bun that came with chilli crab meat sauce. It was so yummy and if there wasn't any time limit on the buffet I'd just sit there and keep on ordering this dish (heheh).We ordered quite a few dishes from the dim sum selection such as chicken feet in black bean sauce, pork siew mai with baby abalone, juicy pork xiao long bao, and the yummy deep-fried escargot dumplings. I never seen or heard of any escargot dumplings before so we decided to order it. It was a sweet and creamy surprise! The Kurobuta char siew bao had a really fluffy exterior and juicy sweet meats on the inside.We really liked how the serving is suited for the number of people in your group. As it was only me and hubby, they gave us a small serving of the braised beef fillet. The beef was really tender and juicy.We really enjoyed our brunch at Cherry Garden and looking forward to go back there again next time we're in Singapore. The dim sum costs SGD $68 per person and there are two seatings available: 11 AM to 1 PM or 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. It's definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion as well although you might want to book in advance for weekend or public holiday seating."

FOOD - We did not select one of their pre-fixe menus, but instead opted for ordering multiple family-style items as suggested by our waiter. We ordered the Peking duck, scallops, pan seared chicken, fried rice, and wasabi prawns. The food was mediocre at best, aside from the Peking duck - which was quite delicious and I would come back for only that. The other items were nothing special, and certainly not ""Michelin-Star"" quality in our opinion (and we're experienced Michelin Star diners).SERVICE - What a disappointment! For this caliber of a restaurant we were extremely dissatisfied with the waitstaff.  While our courses came out promptly, our table was constantly left with dirty plates for sometimes up to 10 minutes after we had finished eating. Disgusting. We also ended up pouring our own wine several times since the servers did not seem to notice our empty glasses despite how many times they walked by. Unacceptable. The waitstaff was nice but very inattentive to us even though the restaurant was not that busy and we were seated next to the hosts stand. This was another annoyance in itself. Upon arriving we were seated at the table right next to the host stand and entrance - in other words, the worst table in the house. It had no atmosphere and it barely even felt like we were dining in the restaurant. Considering it was 7:45 and the restaurant was less than half full, we requested a different table but were told ""they were completely booked"". By the end of our meal, the restaurant had only became more empty, and there were PLENTY of open tables, so this was quite annoying. Our experience was so disappointing overall we skipped desert and opted to leave early. For a Michelin-Starred restaurant, they have A LOT of areas to be improved."

They really commit to delivering excellent service and deserve due recognition.I enjoyed dinner more than the brunch buffet, mainly because the star of the buffet, the dim sum, was more lose-sum than win-sum.Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of variety, and some very unique selections. The custard bun with chocolate was to me, just delicious. Not too sweet, super rich chocolate filling that other people at the table made rather unflattering analogies with, I was more than happy to eat two.The cooked items such as the pork, duck, and other seafood items and meat were definitely of an excellent standard, and probably stole the show. It's only a pity that there's a limit on how many of certain items you can order because they cost more.The soups were... alright. I wouldn't describe them as bland, but they weren't any better than something you'd order at Soup Restaurant. Overall, while the value for the buffet brunch is undeniable (particularly if you're a bottomless pit comme moi), but I think the quality of the dinner menu is far superior. A good compromise? Go for the buffet, but aim for the cooked items. That's where all the delicious lurks."

I will admit that I feel as if the standard has dropped a little since I first came here. But it's still the best dim sum I've ever had in Singapore.Their dim sum brunch deal is good value for all you can eat. There are a few mis-steps, eg. the skin on the har gau is too thick, the fried tentacles are bland and the hot & sour soup also lacks punch.But there are also a lot of hits. The char siu bao is very well executed, the loh bak guo is in the Singapore hawker style rather than the Cantonese dim sum style but tastes excellent, and I highly recommend the wasabi mayo prawns.Service is professional and polite and the restaurant is a fairly comfortable one to sit in."

Order as many of those little juicy bite-size delicacies of dim sum as you want, and it arrives steaming hot ready to be scooped up and chomped on. Shrimp fillings are surprisingly plump and springy, and the dumpling skin is not too thick (okay, not super thin, but willing to overlook this small fact). If an overload of dumplings isn't enough to satisfy your weekend hangover, top it up with a choice of soup, meat, fish and vegetable dishes-- and even dessert! (I recommend the refreshing watermelon aloe dessert in all its liquid nitrogen foggy goodness). Does this food far exceed any Chinese buffet I've ever experienced back home?

We begin by entering the lounge a hour before service and making a reservation, when we come back the place is full so the only table was across the lounge in the lobby after 15 minutes I had to walk over and ask did you forget about us? She responded no so I asked are we going to get table settings, after ten minutes we got our settings but in between the time we were trying to flag hotel staff but they just seemed to think we were invisible. So when the settings arrived I promptly placed our order, after another 15 minutes our tier of food arrived so we patiently waited but no tea so I had to walk over and  ask is this supposed to be high TEA because our tea hadn't arrived , she says it's coming so I sit back down and five minutes later it arrives. She hastily put the tea down beginning to dash off and I said don't you have cups? All I can say was that the teas were really good but only half of the food was edible because I believe a great deal of the food was done in the morning and some greens were limp bread was hard . All I have to say was that for The Fullerton Bay Hotel a 5 star establishment you should be ashamed of yourselves for not offering the SERVICE that comes with your establishment . My wife and I came for a experience but were treated very very poorly. I definitely will be telling my friends that plan on coming to Singapore to stay away from The Fullerton Bay hotel because if this portion of the hotel treats guest this way I don't know how the rest of the hotel is.

My dad (and his dad) brought us here for tea before it was a luxury hotel. The fact that my bank had a discount going on was also nice. Have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the space. It's much less obvious than the main hall and feels like a quiet nook with views across the water to MBS. The ladies were exceptional in their service and all the lovely snacks were refilled upon requested. My mom loved the lobster tart but as I nearly bit into a piece of shell I stopped after one. The salted caramel tart is to die for but after that you are kinda done with food. It's that rich... All in all a good way to spend the afternoon getting fed little morsels of food and enjoy the view on a not so hot day. I think when it's super sunny it won't be as nice to sit in the atrium. It's is a trade off though: comfortable low couch or high chairs with a great view. Have to say the savoury bites did not disappoint and a good balance with the sweet stuff. Yes. I'm one of those weird ones that don't like too much dessert with my tea.

This chain hails from the Philippines, but they were colonised by the US for half a century so I suppose that gives them some points for lineage.We tried New York's Finest and Four Seasons.New York's Finest was topped with pepperoni, beef salami, ground beef, italian sausage, ham and vegetables. While the toppings were pretty good in both quality and quantity, the crust was disappointing - it was an Asian style crust (like that in a Singaporean Chinese pizza): bready and with no bite.Four Seasons (Pepperoni/Four Cheese/Anchovy/Garlic and Shrimp) had a better crust, which had more bite and was more crisp (though it still wasn't excellent). The toppings were also pleasing - in particular the pepperoni pizza had a generous amount of cheese, which went well with the meaty pepperoni.Pizza in Singapore is quite expensive so it was nice eating here, where both 10"" pizzas we had were $16 each (and that's a nett price at a place with table service, mind you). However 10"" is the smallest size available, so if you're a small eater you're sure to have some left for tea (or supper).The pizza variety is also interesting, with a of stalwarts like pepperoni and more innovative combinations like smoked bacon and red apple."

I have only had three American meals since being here and I'm happy fate brought me to Yellow Cab! (Pizza is Italian...I know...but this was ""New York style"" pizza)The family owned branch is clean, cozy and has a great outdoor patio inside the Raffles Links (CityLink) Mall. Tiara, the young lady who is running the place for the family is very sweet, curious to my palette as an American pizza lover and accommodating for any questions I had regarding the menu and the city in general! And her Aunt, who I call Auntie, helps with the business side and is extremely friendly. I enjoyed it so much on the first stopping by that I came back for a beer and potato skins (called twice baked potatoes here, though that's something different for me in the states) the next day! I would have had a beer the first day but I was incredibly hungover so Tiara and Auntie helped me there too by suggesting the New York's Finest pizza (lots of meat, cheese and some veggies), orange juice, a double espresso and glass after glass of water as well as offered me some headache medicine!The pizza was similar to a California style pizza rather than a New York style, but as I said to them, no one else in the states can make a damn NYC pizza besides NYC anyways! Point being, the pizza was good and satisfying. I only got a 10"" and still had two slices left actually (though I did have 5+ glasses of water).The only downside here is the wait staff is very young and clearly a little inexperienced, though not to the point of bad service, just...new to it. That will get better with time. My suggestion is less talking to each other and more attention to the guests as a few times i saw tables looking for or attempting to get the attention of their server. Only a few minutes would go by but that can make a huge impact on a busy night. Again, teenagers and a new store so that'll happen and will get better. All in all, very happy with everything and the management is heading in the right direction to make a franchise in 3-5 years in Singapore, I'd imagine! Can't wait to stop by again and see the progress next time I'm out here!"
Jang Shou Korean BBQ,"8 Raffles Avenue, #01-13B Esplanade Mall Singapore 039802 Singapore ",039802,1.28966932376699,103.855952707685,[],Stephanie T.,xhBeTgxlGon8gd_gTop-Lw,"Singapore, Singapore",4,4/24/2015,"I'm actually not a fan of Korean beef bbq because the meats are usually tough and dry accompanied with hefty price tags. However, this is obviously a different league and it's an extremely good Korean restaurant for big beef eaters (like me) out there! So, I have always heard about how good this place is from people around me and finally went there once recently. I was skeptical but once I had a bite of every food that I ordered, I was stoked! Although I've never been to Korea but this place offers something as close as to what I've had in Ktown, LA and I must say it tastes like it's 100% authentic. It also stands out among Korean restaurants in Singapore because it's one of the few places (or maybe the only one) in that they offer a ""free flow"" of side dishes including salads and different kinds of kimchi. Just ask the waiters to replenish whatever dish you like.In terms of menu options, I always go for the galbi sal jumulruk which is short rib meat ($48), an chang sal which is inside skirt meat ($48), galbi tang which is boiled beef soup ($20),  and haemol pajeon which is seafood pancake ($18).Interior wise, it's pretty basic, rather simple, noisy on weekends with steamy surrounding from burning charcoal, so not recommended for romantic dates. The only real downside with Jang Shou is that the waiters are somewhat hurried and seems to be on a commission to get you out of the door quickly so that the table can be turned around for new guests. Given this, you may wish to control the speed at which the meat is put on the BBQ to avoid having it all grilled in 15 minutes.Some people even said that the Korean food served is even better than in Korea. I let you be the judge."

Jang Shou BBQ at Esplanade was declared to be one of the best for their BBQ beef as well as Cold Buckwheat Noodles. Their food service is typical to that of any authentic Korean restaurants - they serve the bbq dish first, and there comes the rice or noodle option after. So don't fill yourself up too early by eating the meat with rice like we usually do! Try wrapping it with kimchi and garlic pieces in their fresh lettuce leaves. The meats are really tasty and fresh, with the buttery consistency of melting in your mouth without having to crack a tooth chewing it to death first, which is quite rare for a bbq dish! My favourite is their pork, and a close second would be their beef. If cold noodles served with ice is not to your taste, I would recommend getting their Bean Paste Soup with rice, which is a slightly spicy broth type soup that's bursting with flavour from the tofu, meat and clams! My one gripe is how it's on the pricey side for a set meal. But coming here for lunch with colleagues mean a nice sunny stroll back to the Raffles CBD area along the marina - best view ever!"

Quite pleased that we didn't have to deal with bones, and even more pleased that there was someone to cook it for us. Marinade a bit on the sweet side, but tasty nonetheless. Very tender, nicely charred and melt in one's mouth. Also got the galbi tang with glass noodles which was pretty decent, as was the pa jeon. Starters were OK, prefer the ones at Chang.Ambience: Not as airy as Chang so one leaves the restaurant smelling of BBQ.Service: Pleasant.Overall good value and good food, definitely going back when the craving hits"

You'd see it immediately as soon as you enter.The Cafe looks so cute! My favorite Egg is on the walls, on the tables, everywhere! Place your order on the tablet. Confirm your selection and wait for your order. I got a self tanning pizza and a strawberry Lazy drink.Although not so fond of the drink, the pizza was great! It was too much for me, I brought the left overs which they packaged in a very cute Gudetama box!I also saw a Facebook post saying the Cafe will be closing come November.... too bad.... but I am glad I was able to visit!!!!"

There's plenty of Instagram worthy spots in the restaurant to take pictures. But, with this theme cafe, the food was just mediocre for how expensive it was. We ordered their chocolate mango roll, passion milk chocolate mousse, and their passion fruit tea. Only the mousse was worth it. I could taste the passion fruit and chocolate, and the mousse itself was creamy. However, the mango roll was quite dry in texture, and the passion fruit tea didn't taste like the described fruit. It tasted fruity and bitter at the same time, which wasn't pleasant. I drank it all because I paid for it. But, it wasn't worth the money. We would've ordered their savory items. But, the prices for these dishes were even more ridiculously expensive. Service was also nonexistent from the staff. Overall, I would come into this cafe/restaurant with the expectation that you will take wonderful pictures of Gudetama, and you will eat mediocre food. Just stick with ordering the desserts, as you won't break the bank as much as ordering their entrees. Unless, you find the entrees cute enough for the price for picture taking. Then, enjoy."

Located inside of the Suntec City Mall, you'll be squealing both internally and externally as you come across the cute storefront and then are led inside where there are Gudetama-adorned booths, egg shell chairs, and a plethora of Gudetama faces all over the walls and even ceiling!The menu consists of basic savory fare - eggs benedict, waffles, fries, salad, a burger, and more - and dessert - cheesecake, chocolate cake, pudding, milkshakes, etc. Each item is somehow Gudetama-themed, whether it be with an actual egg item or a Gudetama face on something else. I ordered the Ta-Ma-Go ($17.9 SGD), which were sweet mini cheesecakes deceptively shaped like savory tamago nigiri with a matcha paste (""wasabi"") and syrup (""soy sauce"") on the side. There were 4 cakes and each was topped with a little piece of toasted cake with Gudetama's face, covered in little rice krispies, and wrapped in a black fondant ""seaweed"" strip. While it was cute, it wasn't QUITE as nice as the photo in the menu, and didn't have a lot of flavor except for the actual cheesecake. The boyfriend ordered the Mooooo Fries ($18.5 SGD), which were sweet potato fries covered with cheese, bulgogi and an egg. It was surprisingly a decent portion and the bite I tasted was pretty good. He finished it and actually felt reasonably full afterwards. Service was a bit...below average on our visit. After we requested a few more minutes to peruse the menu before ordering, no one ever came back so we had flag someone down - with much difficulty as the cafe was FAR from busy but none of the employees were looking in our direction. We had to ask for water. It would've also been nice to be able to choose where we sat since one of the adorable Gudetama booths was open but we were sat at a regular table instead. We did receive some Gudetama-shaped cookies after paying which was a nice souvenir, though!Overall, it's a fun place to visit for the novelty and to take photos of and with everything, but probably not worth a second visit due to overpriced, decent but average food and subpar service. I did particularly enjoy the complimentary basket of hard boiled eggs - with bright yellow yolks just like eating Gudetama himself!"

I'm a Gudetama fan, however, this place just missed the mark when it came to the food. The presentation would make you think otherwise right? Wrong. First of all, the prices were outrageous. Absolutely shocking actually. The food was not the best quality at all. Not even close. There are SO many things you could make with eggs. I think they could have totally had an amazing menu. So let's just pretend the little Gudetama faces weren't on the food... well it tasted like something I wouldn't even pay $5 for. The breakfast meal had simple fried egg on top of a SOGGY bread. The salad was simple and the beans are 100 percent straight from a can. Nothing about this is special. The pizza was nothing special at all. Let's just say that appearances in this case are deceiving. The staff was not the most pleasant either. When asked if we could have regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries that one of the dishes is made with, the answer was no. And a blank stare. Literally no sorry or anything. Awkward. And when asked if we can take the paper placemats for keepsake, the answer was also no. I mean, it's PAPER. The only thing this place is good for like I said, is the novelty of it. I would definitely say this was far from eggcellent. Too bad I got too eggcited. By the way, this is no eggzaggeration. I give it a solid one star."

After we were served our food, our server comes and help to cook our food at our table. We ordered the hand pulled noodles so someone came to our table to do it right at our table. It was pretty cool. There's a sauce bar with a wide selection of ingredients to make our own sauces. We made our own but server came by and prepared one of their signature dipping sauce for us as well. It was perfect. It great with everything such as the meat, veggies, and seafood. I loved everything about this place. That's some great service. We are not accustomed to this type service at a shabu shabu restaurant. Most are usually laid back and self service on most things. After raving about this restaurant to a few friends I found out that this place is a chain so when I travel I can have this same experience. I can't wait until I can go back."

They had your typical meats, mushrooms, and green vegetables to offer but what stood out to me was the hand pulled noodles that you can order and someone will come out to make them for you right before your eyes! It's very entertaining and worth the cost in my opinion!This was honestly a normal hot pot place like any other one I've been too, but what stood out to me the most and the reason I am giving this 5 stars is because of the service. The service was go good and made my experience complete and positive! Our waitress was so friendly and would constantly check up on us to see if we needed anything. Our drinks would get refilled without question throughout the night at no additional cost. We each received an apron to not dirty our clothes and I received a hair tie to hold my hair back from the soup. We got plastic bags to put our phones in so they don't get dirty.

It is extremely family friendly and your kids even end up getting toys. Bathrooms are very clean and nice. The waitresses are very courteous and helpful. The tables have phone charges in them!

He then created man, and then restaurants.Man began to whine about PATHETIC SERVICE at restaurants - ESPECIALLY CHINESE restaurants.So God gave man...Hai Di Lao...and caused man to STFU.""Well, I'm sure anyone who complains at Hai Di Lao Hot Pot needs to see a Psychiatrist. My mind is completely blown by the extent of service perfection here...a CHINESE restaurant of all places...so PERFECT that even Western spots and their pompous Maître d' are easily put to shame by these...down-to-earth-so-friendly-I'd-think-they'd-spoon-feed-me-if-I'd-ask servers.SERVICE:Their attention to detail is...NUTS (fine, fine...it is UNCOMMON, RARE, DIFFERENT). Let me elaborate on SOME of them:- Everyone gets a CLOTH apron (not the crappy plastic ones you get at spots like boiling crab) to keep your clothes clean if you happen to be a messy eater OR are experimenting with chopsticks OR have a leaking mouth. She will even put it on FOR you if you agree to wear it. (Or you can be like my cousin and I who insisted to have it on our lap instead).- If you wear glasses, you are gifted a microfiber cloth to clean your glasses with...before and AFTER your meal or as OCD-often-as-you-wish.- If you have any items out on the table...such as phones, pocket cameras...they will provide Ziploc sandwich-size bags for you to put them in...to keep out the steam and oil.- Unless I'm chugging my tea, my glass usually gets to half-empty when a REFILL is provided.- Staff continuously checks in at perfect time intervals to ensure that all is well. Even offering tips on when each ingredient should go in for maximum flavor.- Soup base kept getting refilled without asking. (Hey, don't look at me...it doesn't matter what liquid it is...I am a freaking camel. Ask my cousins...I treated the hot pot like an oasis...)- Staff would sift out the oil/froth buildup from the soup on various intervals to keep the soup ""clean"" and ""healthier"".FOOD:My cousin had the half and half soup base: one side black chicken broth (is IMMACULATE before and after cooking), the other side, a tomato base (if you're a Cioppino-fan OR tomato-paste-lover like me...you will LOVE this base for a hotpot). I'm so thankful she didn't order burn-your-tongue-taste-nothing-ma-la-spicy base.Self-served seasoning bar - you create your own LOVE ELIXIR to go with whatever is cooking.I won't spend too much time talking about the food because at $55-60 average per person as well as a focus on service and perfection, the food did NOT fall short. I really enjoyed the quality of the meats and even dipped them for 2 seconds to eat them on the mid-raw side.I must admit that I can't get over the broth. I am in love with it and I have never found myself saying that before...where I enjoyed the soup base PRE-cooking and POST-cooking. It was GREAT - totally epically AWESOME.Oh yeah, we didn't order the pulled-noodle but saw from the other table that it involves a man doing the ""noodle dance"" that gets the dough to the right length and consistency before they cut it. Quite entertaining to see how it never touches him or the floor as he does his advanced rope-twirling-dance.ATMOSPHERE & OTHER PERKS:You know it's packed but it DOESN'T feel like it is. The table is spacious and distanced properly to give a somewhat suburban feel that doesn't make you feel like a sardine.You're taken care of from the moment you're in the establishment, especially if you didn't make a reservation. There is a waiting area for children to hang out in...watch TV and play various things.Above all things, they also give FREE MANICURES...w-t-h... /mind-blownYelp 100: 12/100"

That is not to say that the wait is any shorter here. Even if you call ahead to make reservation, it is most likely that you'd still have to wait. The plus point is that the service is great (especially given that they are all from China where service is questionable), they also have lots of other entertainment while you wait. In this outlet, you get pedi/mani, the kids get a ball room to jump in, and you also get free flow of popcorns, drinks, snacks and fruits.On to the main course - the hotpot. I still prefer the steamboat at imperial treasure over this. The offering is pretty much similar and the price point is actually lower than at Imperial Treasure. But imperial treasure is a Hong Kong style steamboat while HDL is a china style steamboat. The tastes do come across as such too. It is not about one is better than the other, it is more which one you prefer.HDL - cheaper but the taste is not as refined as imperial treasure. Great service staff though."

Thankfully, I happen to be part of the vacation-ing class of Singaporeans who have nothing better to do on a Monday at lunchtime than to indulge in some authentic ma la hot pot. There was barely any crowd at lunch and we managed to get a table without any wait. The pork belly slices were very good. They were so good that they managed to con us to order a second serving, in which the quality of the meat noticeably dropped :(The sliced pork was ok, but I'd recommend going for the pork belly instead.The US beef slices were yummy too. My only qualm with the meat slices were that they were cut slightly too thick. I'd have preferred it better if they were just a tad thinner.The $4/ pax cost for sauces seemed a little overpriced at first, but we soon realised that it included the appetizer peanuts and post meal fruits/ desserts, making the price seem justifiable. We didnt know that the drinks were free flow at $3/pax. We stuck to ordering water/ tea, but being kiasu Singaporeans, would probably have expanded our selection if we knew it wasnt going to cost more.The handmade prawn paste was interesting, as the paste curled up to look like shrimps after they were cooked. For $3 per serving, you can watch a live demonstration of the chef pulling the la mian noodle. And here I say that you're paying $3 to watch a show, since I definitely wouldnt pay that money for the very average noodles.The Mushroom medley was delightful for mushroom lovers. The ma la pot is pretty thumb numbing-ly spicy. You've been warned!The bill came up to be about $50/pax which was kinda expected (given all the $$$ ratings), but still a tad pricey considering that we didnt order much food.Still, I'd say that it is one of the better hot pot joints around!PS. Sharing a friend's recipe for the sauce station: Hoisin sauce, korean chilli, garlic, dash of sesame oil. Pretty good combination I must say!"

The food was good - the Mala chili soup was spicy without it being too tongue numbing, and I would definitely recommend trying their handmade lamian. Their services are ; They definitely go all out to entertain their customers. While waiting for a table, they provide all sorts of entertainment; ladies you can even have a few gel manicure (their manicurists are skilled but not to the point of doing intrinsic designs). They also give you access to their ""snack"" bar - free flow of drinks and assorted fruit. Before you begin eating, people with long hair will be offered a hair tie.  When you order the handmade lamian, a guy will perform a sort of dance to pull the noodles. The thing that irked me most was the queue. Even with reservations, we waited for over an hour on a weekday night. When we saw a free table, we asked if we could sit there (we were a group of 5), the hostess said the table was meant for groups of 8-10. 5 minutes later, she gave the table to a group of 5...Anyway, on average, you can expect to wait for an hour to 3 hours during peak period. I guess that's why they go all out to entertain their guests? Still too ridiculously long for me to come back. Maybe next time I'll come back during lunch hour."

The mala was really really spicy, my tongue went numb as I ate whatever we'd plonked into the hot pot (we all had the good sense to avoid drinking the soup). The chicken broth was tasty and we drank bowls of this down!Ordering is via an iPad app (comes in both english and mandarin), and is pretty straightforward. An average plate of beef (probably enough to serve at least 3) is about $15. Even the cheapest ones were of good quality and well-marinated. We had the beef, chicken and pork- all were very good.The handmade noodles were hailed as a ""must-try"". Basically, you have this ""noodle master"" (a guy) coming up to you and swinging the dough around skillfully as he makes his noodles in front of your table. It was very interesting to watch! But I'm not a big fan of noodles in hot pot so it's more of a once-off for noveltys' sake for me.Service was excellent too. The servers were polite, attentive and we were given ziploc bags to protect our phones, microfibre cloth to wipe our glasses with, hair ties to tie our hair (so that they wouldn't interfere with us eating) and bibs to protect our clothes with.The 5 of us were stuffed at the end, and it was to our pleasant surprise that the bill was only $38 (after tax) per person.

The food is standard but with this price the portion should be bigger and the presentation should be better...E.g. the seafood ""platter"" comes in a plastic plate and the 3 pieces of mussel, 2 shrimps and I forgot what else all lump together....Service....the waitresses are keen but I'm not used to all the rush in putting the whole plate of raw beef into the hot pot, while there are other cooked food in the pot......not a good hot pot manner to mix raw and cooked food together....the veggie and noodle all got overcooked when the beef is ready....mmmm.....The dessert is also lame....disappointed...."

We waited for approximately 20 minutes and spent our time trying to solve rubix cube and eating the snacks provided to us. The menu and ordering process were simple and straightforward. Once I tasted the food I was let down. The sauces were bland (we got chicken and tomato) and the prawns were slightly bitter. The reason why I give the review three stars is due to the service. The wait staff were attentive and the food was brought out quickly. All that said... I was disappointed by the underwhelming meal and the price was steep for such."

Ask the waitress for them, and the chef will come out and perform an acrobatic show using the noodles for you. Then you get to put it in your hotpot for consumption. It's kinda like a gimmick for entertainment purposes, but hey at least the noodles are good.The service here is legendarily good, even in their stores in China (yes don't gasp, it's true!). In no other Chinese restaurant here in Singapore do I find such great customer service from the staff who are friendly, accommodating, and gives good recommendations for your food. Our waitress was nice enough to let us know that we've ordered too much, and told us that if it wasn't enough we can always order more later.Overall, I'd go back again. Tips are to go late in the evening (around 10pm or later) so that it's easier to get a seat. You have been warned!"

Free snacks - popcorn, banana chips, watermelon slices, oranges2. Manicure bar - ladies, get in line to get your nails done for free!3.

I loaded my sauce bowl up with mushroom sauce, sesame sauce, minced garlic and loads of cilantro & sesame seeds (and some fried soya beans for extra crunch, yum!).Chose black chicken soup & seafood soup. Black chicken was nice, seafood soup was meh. Will be adventurous and try the mild mala soup or mushroom soup next time.Meats and seafood were fresh. Beef tripe and pork kidney were delicious. Service was ok, was not given a plastic cover for my phone on the table. Drinks were topped up regularly in the beginning then service kind of tapered off as we started eating.

When I first read about this restaurant on a friend's facebook post, I couldn't believe what I read. Amongst other wonderful service they provide, like board games and snacks while you wait, free manicures for ladies, playroom for kids, apron for dining, ziplock bags for your devices, it was said that they provide a baby cot for the baby to sleep and play next to your table while you dine. Seriously? This is unheard of that a restaurant in singapore that will provide a cot for  my baby to sleep in while I dine. Awesome! I gotta check that out for myself. A few days later, I went with some friends to check out the place. And true enough, if you make your reservation and indicate that you are bring along a baby, a baby cot is prepared next to your table. They even have toys in the cot to entertain the baby. Aside from the service, the food is great too! Love their soup base, the ingredients that they use and the varied selection of the sauces. The broth is flavorful and delicious and the ingredients for the hot pot are fresh. Don't forget to order at least an order of their la mien, you also get a short performance with a wait staff doing a ""noodle dance"" that often diners would enjoy. Everything is perfect ... except the price. haha... it can be pretty pricey as they do not have buffet. Since then, I am sold in going to HaiDiLao for hotpot. Its an awesome dining experience and we always go home stuffed and happy. Remember to make your reservation, else the wait can be 2-3 hours during peak hours.  From what I remembered, for weekdays, the last reservation is at 6.30pm and for weekends, the last reservation is at 6pm."

My friend was smart enough to have reserved a dinner two weeks in advance, or we would have had to wait hours to get a table. But even if you have to wait you can enjoy some delightful perks, including snacks and tea, board games, and even a MANICURE (for the ladies only, unfortunately)!!The food is also excellent. Tasty, fun, and presented very well. The Szechuan broth was certainly ""ma la"" (numb) but not spicy enough to prevent you from enjoying it. Just be cautious of the pool of oil when you remove your food from the pot. Next, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ordering a set of noodles. A slab of dough will be tossed into strands of deliciousness right in front of your eyes. It's truly a sight to behold. I'd pay money just to see that happen again.One of the best parts of the experience is the DIY sauce station. With around a dozen base ingredients to choose from, you will surely be satisfied. The sauce station also houses the restaurant's amazing soybean pudding (dou hua). I alone had 5 servings of it. Just delicious and very well textured.Though I never received a ziplock bag for my camera and electronics, I did receive a cute apron and enjoyed wonderful service from the waiters. Even the notion of ordering your food on an iPad (with full descriptions of most items) was mind blowing. What was crazy was the sight of a crib with a baby sleeping in it. THAT was a first and quite incredible. Other restaurants need to learn from HDL."

Was very conveniently located. And the outside seating was excellent. The evening view of the riverside bridges and buildings made it a very tranquil environment.I ordered the Mini Chimichanga made with chicken as an appetizer. And for the main course I ordered the chicken fajitas. Everything was served timely and hot. The ingredients were fresh & tasty. I tried three different margaritas. Remand they have so many more selections of them.  Premium margarita was great and cooling.Tried their Patron margaritas with raspberry and the last one was Pink guava. The price was very reasonable. And from 10pm till closing the margaritas are half off their house selection. Can't wait to come here again. Very satisfied and happy!!!!!!

Yay:Chips and salsa - free and delicious Guacamole side - quite yums and flavorful Calamari: nicely fried, awesome sauce Quesadilla with chicken $21 - I love melted cheese! Decent fish, nothing wow or meh about it NahChimichangas - dough quite thick, so so stuffing, too much sour cream Pork carnitas tacos - not the pulled pork I expected, but still yummy pork chunks. Taco skin was a fail. 2 out of 3 skins were abandoned Nachos $20 - overloaded with ingredients, must be shared by 4 or more otherwise wont be finished, chips were very thick unlike the free bowl which was nicer and crispier If I will be back it'll be for the happy hour original/peach magaritas (which was beyond sad after it melted in an hour) and the one tiny bowl of chips and salsa.

The Red Snapper Burritos ($25) made a stunning entrance like a curvy oblong-shaped parcel, only to reveal a luscious interior of fish, borraco beans, Mexican rice and strands of Mozzarella-cheddar melting mid-way. This could be a potentially great dish if the snapper was not too dry. Puerco en Chile Verde ($14) sounded exotic but it striked a nostalgic chord even if you had not experience any Mexican life before. There isn't so much firepower in this spicy pork stew. But being thick and warm, it goes ideally with the toasted tortillas or simply a direct fast track into your mouth. How does having some tequila in your seafood sounds? The Prawn Brochette ($35) is a skewer of roughly 5-6 lime marinated prawns with smoky tequila glaze, served with grilled vegetables on a stick. It has a heady aroma, though the glaze was short of the wild character of liquor. Nonetheless, the Tequila glaze was an instant hit with the 1/2 Chicken ($28) as the toasty caramelized taste emerged from the skin which retained the moisture of the meat.  The standout dish was the Shredded Steak Chimchangas ($25), a golden crispy flour tortilla that is deep-fried to perfection such that it kept the juicy strands of beef warm and comfortable while displaying resilience any sogginess. Drenched in generous amount of sour cream and guacamole, this giant plate of meaty ""Popiah"" roll is messy but speaks right to your soul. I don't fancy banana desserts but I may have to take back my statement on the Banana Chimichangas ($14) here. Just like the earlier savoury chimichanga, the filling is substituted with bananas, deep fried till the shell turned into a crunchy fritter. Wallop a huge scoop of fragrant and buttery avocado ice cream and you'll get something that is ten times better than any chocolate lava cake or any hot-cold dessert. There is also the Sauteed Kahlua-glazed Bananas ($14) for those who are less keen on deep-fried food. This ain't no flouncy haute style ala minute flambé bananas but a rustic tropical dessert that sits on a rich and decadent sauce. Other selections include a gluten-free Ancho Chile Chocolate Cake ($14) and Churros ($12) but the former two banana desserts are more satisfying for the bucks and calories.Spice-wise, the dishes are tuned to a temperate palette, yet there were moments during the feast when I thought I was eating Indian briyani. No wonder they say that Indian and Mexican cuisine are actually quite similar! In fact, I was told that about 50% of the customers are Indians. Well, there are three different kinds of authentic Mexican hot sauces aplenty of the table for you to adjust the heat to your preference. Both indoors and outdoors seating are non-air-conditioned but I highly recommend the indoors seating if you want to enjoy the food heartily away from any outdoor smoking."

What came out was a dry, chewy flour-filled abomination that barely resembled one. The enchiladas were not much better. They arrived slathered in cheese, but the taste was barely registering on my tongue. I was left clutching the bottle of habanero sauce attempting to add some zing to what was left sitting on my plate.Maybe my expectations are elevated cos of the years living in CA, visiting the local taco stand, and crossing the border into TJ.I'm wondering how this place gets 4 stars...

The margaritas are still fantastic and the setting on the Singapore River is lovely, but the food is in steady decline.  We ate on a very quiet Sunday evening. Jumbo, the restaurant next to Cafe Iguana, was packed, but we were one of only a few active tables at Cafe Iguana.The meal started with flavorless and exceptionally cold (a theme for the meal) salsa. The refrigerated salsa tasted like pureed tomatoes with little added to that. Tortilla chips without any salt or flavoring at all on them and the free appetizer seems designed to keep people from wanting seconds.I had the shrimp burrito with the oddly named carne de puerco en chile verde. On the positive side, the pork green chili stew was the best thing on the table all night. Genuinely delicious albeit oddly named as there was absolutely nothing green about it. Very standard reddish brown chili/stew color without any visible green capsicum or anything green.  Sadly, the burrito itself was a huge disappointment... very few shrimp (but those that were there tasted pretty good) mixed with isolated clumps of different ingredients (i.e., so you get several servings of nothing but beans, followed by one serving of nothing but shrimp, etc.) on a tortilla that was mostly raw and topped (after ""cooking"") with raw (unmelted) cheese (see photo).The kids had the mini tostadas and a quesadilla.  Both were mostly left on the plate.The taco salad did little to resemble a taco or its typical ingredients. Essentially a load of plain lettuce sitting on a pancake flat raw tortilla with a dab of sour creme hidden under the tortilla that my wife didn't even find until after she stopped eating. Only about a third of the salad was eaten.  Finally, service was painfully slow and we had to ask four times to get someone to bring a glass of water. What used to be an almost iconic Mexican restaurant in Singapore has matured into a tired and uninspired disappointment."

So all of the aforementioned made the dining experience quite nice.As far as the food goes it's all pretty OKAY. I tried the shredded beef burrito, red snapper burrito, quesadillas, nachos, and churros. Everything was a pretty good rendition of what I'm used to back home in Texas, but nothing really could compare to even middle of the road tex-mex places. However based upon the standard of Mexican food in Singapore, it's not bad. The drinks were pretty weak though, I could barely taste the tequila.This restaurant is really over priced though. Expect to spend around $30-45 a head for just an entree and not much more. Overall I wouldn't mind going again, but the pricing and food isn't overall good enough to make this a regular spot for me."

You can definitely tell it is a Mexican restaurant as soon as you step close to the greeter podium - the Latin music that gets your feet doing a little dance and the Mother of Mary statue standing tall just behind the cashier. The menu is pretty typical Mexican food - burritos, fajitas and they have free flow of chips and salsa! Gotta love that chips and salsa since that is pretty rare to come across in Singapore. I ordered a plate of green chili stew. My first impression - is this what we ordered? If you are used to the more traditional green chili stew, this dish will not live up to your expectations. It DOES NOT look or taste anything like green chili stew AT ALL. BUT, I do have to give them a thumbs up for that dish because it was a pretty flavorful stew. It tasted more like a meat and potato stew with Mexican spices. The stew came with salted steamed black beans and Spanish rice. They also served it with a side of two tortilla. I would definitely get this dish again on my next visit. You just have to not expect the traditional way here. Go adventure!"

Plus, I didn't know of any other Mexican restaurants in Singapore - so it was quite the routine - to go there and have a jug of margaritas (to share, or, er... not) and Mexican fare.What I Love: They have great drinks. Their margarita flavors are pretty cool. A jug is $57 from 8-11pm. But if you get one after, it's like $39 or something? Which is quite a deal actually. I like that they have half-price and Post Happy Hour prices. They have a pretty cool comprehensive menu detailing their Half-Price discounts. I LOVE their menu - its comprehensive, easy to read and clear. Their drinks and tequila menu is pretty great too. Have tried their Quesadillas, Fajitas, Tortillas, and other stuff that's pretty darn good. Try and explore the menu!What I Don't Love: Their prices. Can get pretty steep. Good to share."

Surprisingly they give free chips and salsa and free refills in soft drinks ( not common in SG). The salsa has a bit of smokey chipotle flavor and decent chips.

I don't know how my husband found it (TripAdvisor?) but it was also listed in the Lonely Planet Singapore travel book. My husband really loves crab, and although I do like crab, it's not my favorite - just because it's way too much work. The deal was, he would crack open every shell for me to eat here. Damn good deal huh? So we went!For the two of us, we ordered:*Chili crab - it goes by the Kilogram. We asked for 1 kg, but they were only doing 800-900 g that day. We went with 900g. You can choose the type of crab you want (Alaskan Crab, Mud Crab, or Dungeness Crab), and also the type of sauce/preparation you prefer (Award winning Chili sauce, Signature Black Pepper, Stir Fried Salted Golden Egg, or Chinese Wine and Egg White. We ended up getting the Mud crab with Award winning chili. The crab was plentiful and delicious - sweet and briny tasting, something that we can't get in the US I feel like. The chili sauce was something special too - like a sweet tomato sauce (best way I can describe it). *Live Prawns with Cereal - this was very, very good. I wasn't sure when I saw the menu what they meant by ""cereal,"" but it basically was this brown-sugar flavored panko - so think sweet flavor, with the salty live prawns - GREAT flavor combo. I would highly recommend ordering this one. You can order, small, med, lrg. *Kang Kong Stir Fried with Sambal - never had this green before, but I guess it's a water spinach. This was also very good, easy to eat with that tasty sambal sauce. Another big yum if you want to feel ""healthy"" eating greens*Supreme Seafood Fried Rice - we definitely wanted a fried rice to share, and this one was recommended on their menu. *2 Tiger Beers, and 1 coke. Beer was good, but the Coca Cola really hit the spot eating it with the chili crab - would recommend the coke lol. Overall, pretty good meal, I would recommend if you are are a huge crab fan."

Also tried the Jellyfish dish, which was....interesting. Haha!The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. My dinner party sat outside and it was the perfect temperature. Lots of tables and people sitting outside. You also have a nice view of the lagoon/lake. Also, it was situated in a place that had a boardwalk feel with tons of restaurants, bars, nightlife, etc. So it was very convenient. Took a taxi to the restaurant, so not sure about parking."

Chilli Crab2. Salted Egg Crab (if you can't take spicy/chilli)3. Salted egg fish skin4. Salted egg prawns5. Spinach with century egg/salted eggBefore ordering any crab, double check with the staff what's the pricing for the crabs, on 2nd Jan 2019, the pricing was $88++ per kg. I ordered a salted egg crab and asked for the smallest size, the staff told me it was 900g and I agreed, but when the bill came, they charged us $88 and I queried the staff and the staff said, the crab that was sent to my table was indeed 900g then I asked why was I charged $88? He apologised and reprinted the bill with a $8.80 discount.So beware when you get the bill that the pricing of the crab reflects the weight of the crab that you ordered.The salted egg fish skin is freshly fried upon order and hence it's way better than any of the pre-packaged junk food that you get at convenience stores or supermarkets.Always make a reservation, I called up and they told me that they were fully booked and that I had to walk in. I didn't give up and found Jumbo listed on Chope, a reservation website and managed to make a 730pm booking on Chope.

I researched best places to eat chill crab in Singapore and this restaurant popped up among two others. My coworker and I chose this one because it had Riverside seating. When I read reviews a lot of people mentioned that it was pricey. I wish I would've researched that part a bit more cause I definitely got some sticker shock. $100 per crab!!! They're huge but it's still a lot of money.Was it worth it? Honestly, yes!!!! I actually went to go eat one more before I left Singapore.I got the chili crab cause I like to try the typical, traditional dish first. The sauce was a tiny bit sweet which I was not crazy about at first but as I started to eat, I loved it more. My coworker order the pepper crab. It was soooo much pepper! They do not take cheap out on the black pepper! My friend was suffering after awhile cause it was a bit too spicy for her. These crabs do not come with any sides so I had to order a fried rice on the side. Overall I think we spent $250 on lunch! Crazy I know but hey, how often do you get to eat chili crab in Singapore?The offered other seafood dishes as well. If I could have afforded it I would have ordered more."

Teochew and Hokkien cooking really knows how to take seafood to the next level that you won't find anywhere else in the world. Behold, the famous Singaporean Chili/Black Pepper Crab! We ordered also the baby squid, taro scallop, Salted Egg Shrimp, and Pork alongside. A feast for a king for sure! Worth the money if you love high end bougie hearty stuff. This is located right by the Quay, so you get lovely scenery and the bar scene is super nice at night after you're done. Great pics of the skyline of Singapore from here as well. Pork: Goodness, ribs done to the next level. Savory, sweet, and covered with the satisfying almond crunch on top. Great way to kick off our meal Baby Squid: Taste of sweet sesame over crunchy but still slightly chewy squid. Baby squid is tender and having each individual squid per bite is so different from rings or calamari in my opinion. The texture and taste is sweet and naturally tender. Taro Scallop- If you love taro, then you gotta try Teochew or Singaporean version of taro. It is usually fried until aromatic paired with some coconut milk and gingko nuts at the end of a high end meal. This is to the next level- they deep fried it with these large succulent scallops in the middle. Holy cow. If this is not some delicious rich stuff, then idk what else is. Salted Egg Shrimp: Does this meal get  better or what? Salted egg is such a unique thing to Singapore- they even started a salted egg crusted fish skin as local potato chips which are also DELICIOUSLY sinful. Forget about popcorn shrimp- you use egg yolks as the crust?? Holy cow, my arteries are crying but in joy. Would do it again- salty, rich and not super crunchy and overly salty like a potato chip, this is a worth it dish to get. AND NOW.... the chili crab. Bro prepare to get your hands dirty, b/c the point of this dish is to finish that sauce that the crab has taken time to brew and stew in. The crab is delicious, but that chili paste that this thing has been cooking in is a complexly layered seafood chili thing that you must dip the sweet bun into. Better not leave any sauce left b/c it's worth like 1$ a bite on this dish and the sauce is EXCELLENT. Worth getting this. Take a stroll down Clarke's Quay afterwards for a neon lights reflecting on the water, chill bars, and the singapore Marina Sands Hotel reflecting across the waterways."

Everything else was delicious too, so I dont think you can go wrong with picking anything here! You eat the chilicrab with your hands and they provide bibs (like the crab/shrimp spot, Boiling Crab) as well as food grade gloves upon request.This place does fall into some tourist traps though: they come by to leave peanuts, but don't tell you that they will charge it on your bill,  you only have a limited time before you are ushered out to seat more guests, and the water is charged as well. (Though to be fair, it is bottle water). Flagging down a waiter to get anything was incredibly difficult where at one point, two tables next to us were waiting to get thier bill, trying to flag someone down as well.

As we walked to the table the hostess informed us that we would need to be finished by 6:20pm. The place was packed and we were seated next to the walk way and the garbage/dirty dish area. We asked again and were pretty much ignored as the wait staff yelled at one another over us. The service itself isn't that great, so remember to focus why you're there in the first place...to try the chili crab!We ordered 1kg of mud crab to be cooked in the chilli style. They have other ways to prepare it, but we stuck with what Singapore is famous for. Singaporeans also consider this to be one of their national dishes. We also ordered the salted egg prawns. Our order came out pretty quickly. It was a nicely presented mud crab in a dish of chilli type sauce. The great news is that most of the crab is already pre-cracked and broken apart, making this much easier and quicker to eat. The flavor did not disappoint. It was a nice red sauce that had a slight heat mixed in with the sweet. If I had known better, I would have ordered some bread to soak up the sauce but we were so full we didn't need it.The salted egg prawn was delicious. It is basically a tempura shrimp dusted in some sort of sweet salt. It was delicious. Overall, we spent about $120USD and had good food, with a terrible spot in the restaurant and pretty poor service."

At first glance, it looks poppin'! They have an automated electronic queue system to handle the big lines at their doors. I was hopeful HOWEVERI have had chili crab before by the bay and others, and this was extremely disappointing. Presentation was good, the meal altogether was mediocre at best. You have to order the rice and fried buns, traditional sides chili crab comes with, a la carte? To me it didn't taste fresh. The fried shrimp was oddly a little soggy, and the crab was practically glued to the shell - something I've never experienced before. The taste was good but you are definitely better off getting crab by the bay - better pricing for WAY better food.It was very clear that they were understaffed, as the service was terrible. None of the food came out at the same time, the waiter kept forgetting what we asked for, and they don't have napkins? It took nearly 20 minutes after we ate for someone to come and clear the check. The interior was a mess. On the surface level, it looks clean and nice. However the front desk was loaded w a hodgepodge full of random stuff, trash was overflowing. Inside the storage for the restaurant was clearly visible. The bathroom was atrocious - and the only was to get though to it was through a hall behind the kitchen. A cook and I almost ran into each other on the way out from the bathroom (gross!)Jumbo is definitely a bit of a tourist trap...and if you're in the mood for chili crab and can't go for I guess it would suffice?

Heard about this popular place from a few local friends and decided to check it out. If you are planning to eat here, I highly recommend putting in reservations way beforehand. Once you get your RSVP secured, do make sure to show up on time or else you will lose your spot to the other hungry individuals who are waiting around and trying to get in without needing a RSVP.Once seated, it's time to put on some bibs and feast. Highly recommend ordering chili crab!! For a party of 3-4, one chili crab is enough to feed everyone. With the abundance of chili, I suggest getting a couple of side dishes since eating the crab itself isn't too filling if you're hungry. For the side dishes, I recommend getting the scallop appetizers plus rice or noodles. The scallop appetizers itself was a very unique dish. Crispy with taro on the outside and hot and soft on the inside, this is definitely yummy and different. As for the fried rice we got, it wasn't anything too stellar but it went well with the leftover chili once the crab meat was gone. We also ordered the recommended fried mini buns but found it to be quite underwhelming in comparison to most of the food that was ordered. NOTHING IS FREE, so do keep in mind that if you drink the tea on the table, or touch those small plates of peanuts, you will have to pay for it. Tricky tricky, I know. Even asking for water will equal to you paying for it. Service overall was quick and efficient. Every table has a time limit, so do observe the time.

After reading that Jumbo Seafood was the place to try it I had to check it out. I wanted to go to Clarke Quay anyway and am glad I made the choice. They were lines of people waiting to be seated but the system was very organized and the wait was less than five minutes. I snagged a seat outside with views of the water. Service was excellent. The table was preset with peanuts (they charge you extra for this but don't tell you beforehand) Jasmine tea, and anything you could need for eating seafood. I Perused the menu but ultimately succumbed to the classic chili crab. First I started off with a glass of tiger beer. This was refreshing and a good way to cool off from the humidity outside.  I had my seafood eating bib, utensils, and disposable gloves (I had seen other diners using this and I am so glad that I requested them). My chili crab was brought out very shortly.  It was  everything it's been ""cracked up"" to be. The sauce was heavenly, The crab was super fresh.

This is all I eat here and will ever eat here because I can't get anything anywhere else that tastes as good as these dishes do here.If, like me, your companion doesn't eat seafood and is allergic to shellfish, there are limited options.That being said, I always get the Black Pepper crab. And I eat the whole thing! Sometimes I've had two, but they were pressed for the table so one had to do this time... This is by far the BEST Black Pepper crab you can get in Singapore. I've had Black Pepper crab in other restaurants (non-Jumbo). I have tried, White Pepper crab and nothing comes even close to the heavenly, yummy, deliciousness that is Black Pepper crab from Jumbo. I tried the Chili Crab, but for me the the Chili hides the taste of the crab, whereas the Black Pepper enhances it. In addition, the Chili crab is slightly sweet, which I don't like.Baby KaiLan in Garlic Sauce. OMG, so good! Cooked to the perfect tenderness and crunchiness. Not overly garlicky, in case you are concerned about that. My boyfriend had the Rib Eye with Black Pepper Sauce and he thought that while it wasn't your traditional au Poivre sauce, it was good, especially considering the options.Their house red wine is also pretty good. Don't hesitate.That's all folks. Honestly, this is a MUST if you visit Singapore. They have several other locations, in case Riverside Point is booked. If you go, book and book early to ensure your seat."

We sat outside under the cover of the canopy, so it was nice to see the water and lights around us as we ate. I would recommend refusing the tea and peanuts at the beginning of the meal if you don't want to pay for them. Skip all the extras like the seafood fried rice (overrated and overpriced) and get yourself a chili crab, a few fried mantous per person, and garlic baby bok choy. Pray that your food comes all at once and you're not devouring the veggies while waiting for your crab, and then waiting for the plain white rice when you're already 3/4 done with your crab.As for the chili crab, the sauce is just amazing! We paid about $88 SGD for a 1.3 kg crab. It can get messy, so just release your inhibitions, put on your bib, and dig in! The rice and fried buns are just vehicles to eat as much of the delicious sauce as possible. If I had no shame, I would've taken the leftover sauce home with us.

It was a bit spicy for my liking to enjoy it fully. The price for two crabs and a can of soda, came out to about $150 US dollars.

We came to this particular JUMBO seafood since it was closest to our hotel. Based on recommendations from other fellow travelers, we came here specifically for the Chilli Crab. When we arrived we were seated right away and during the chaos of being seated WHILE they were getting the table ready, they offered tea along with peanuts (we later found out tea was 2 SGD per person and peanuts were also 2SGD) and was never communicated to us they were for a charge. While we were there, service was soso, tea was rarely refilled and we had to flag down our waiter to place our order. We also had to flag down our server for the bill and it took about 20min for our credit card to be returned to us. I understand it's an extremely busy restaurant but for what they charge, I'd expect more attentiveness in terms of service.

Expect to order a selection of smaller dishes, and one or two bigger ones if you're in a party.

Hits included baby squid and a surprisingly gamey Peking duck; misses included salted egg shrimp ( undercooked batter, more akin to unfinished scrambled egg) and scallop and yam fritters ( strangely boring pucks of brown matter around soft and tasteless scallops).

Food was good but my complaints are just that the service was not good, they are not attentive nor friendly. They nickel and dime you for everything including the ""peanuts and tea"" they place on the table for their customers. They should really not give peanuts unless it is requested because tourists or non-regulars will not be aware and see that their are additional charges on their bill. Just seems sneaky and shady."

Food quality is so-so. Having tasted both chilli crab and black pepper crab, I prefer the black pepper crab, because chilli crab seems to use a lot of ketchup and is too sweet for my taste. Service is poor. On our recent visit, the server kept coming over to take away empty, or not quite empty, dishes on the table one by one -- great way to make sure your guests get annoyed and leave within minutes, I reckon. Expensive. We spent S$200 on a dinner for three, including one black pepper crab, some seafood tofu dish that tasted a bit off, a vegetable dish, rice and a jug of Tiger beer. Disappointing beer for disappointing food."

Of course you have to get chili crab. Don't forget the wee fried buns to dip in the chili sauce- that's half the fun. I know this place is famous for the crab but I love the pumpkin shrimp. It's full of flavor and has crisp veggies underneath. It's easily my favorite dish here. The salted egg shrimp are good too. If your group is big enough order the whole duck. They prepare it table side. The crispy skin is removed and sliced then rolled in cigars. The rest is chopped and served on a platter. The flavor is great - deep and smokey. I've never had any room for dessert when we eat here! Too much seafood in the way."

I don't know how my husband found it (TripAdvisor?) but it was also listed in the Lonely Planet Singapore travel book. My husband really loves crab, and although I do like crab, it's not my favorite - just because it's way too much work. The deal was, he would crack open every shell for me to eat here. Damn good deal huh? So we went!For the two of us, we ordered:*Chili crab - it goes by the Kilogram. We asked for 1 kg, but they were only doing 800-900 g that day. We went with 900g. You can choose the type of crab you want (Alaskan Crab, Mud Crab, or Dungeness Crab), and also the type of sauce/preparation you prefer (Award winning Chili sauce, Signature Black Pepper, Stir Fried Salted Golden Egg, or Chinese Wine and Egg White. We ended up getting the Mud crab with Award winning chili. The crab was plentiful and delicious - sweet and briny tasting, something that we can't get in the US I feel like. The chili sauce was something special too - like a sweet tomato sauce (best way I can describe it). *Live Prawns with Cereal - this was very, very good. I wasn't sure when I saw the menu what they meant by ""cereal,"" but it basically was this brown-sugar flavored panko - so think sweet flavor, with the salty live prawns - GREAT flavor combo. I would highly recommend ordering this one. You can order, small, med, lrg. *Kang Kong Stir Fried with Sambal - never had this green before, but I guess it's a water spinach. This was also very good, easy to eat with that tasty sambal sauce. Another big yum if you want to feel ""healthy"" eating greens*Supreme Seafood Fried Rice - we definitely wanted a fried rice to share, and this one was recommended on their menu. *2 Tiger Beers, and 1 coke. Beer was good, but the Coca Cola really hit the spot eating it with the chili crab - would recommend the coke lol. Overall, pretty good meal, I would recommend if you are are a huge crab fan."

Spinach with century egg/salted eggBefore ordering any crab, double check with the staff what's the pricing for the crabs, on 2nd Jan 2019, the pricing was $88++ per kg. I ordered a salted egg crab and asked for the smallest size, the staff told me it was 900g and I agreed, but when the bill came, they charged us $88 and I queried the staff and the staff said, the crab that was sent to my table was indeed 900g then I asked why was I charged $88? He apologised and reprinted the bill with a $8.80 discount.So beware when you get the bill that the pricing of the crab reflects the weight of the crab that you ordered.The salted egg fish skin is freshly fried upon order and hence it's way better than any of the pre-packaged junk food that you get at convenience stores or supermarkets.Always make a reservation, I called up and they told me that they were fully booked and that I had to walk in. I didn't give up and found Jumbo listed on Chope, a reservation website and managed to make a 730pm booking on Chope.

When I read reviews a lot of people mentioned that it was pricey. I wish I would've researched that part a bit more cause I definitely got some sticker shock. $100 per crab!!! They're huge but it's still a lot of money.Was it worth it? Honestly, yes!!!! I actually went to go eat one more before I left Singapore.I got the chili crab cause I like to try the typical, traditional dish first. The sauce was a tiny bit sweet which I was not crazy about at first but as I started to eat, I loved it more. My coworker order the pepper crab. It was soooo much pepper! They do not take cheap out on the black pepper! My friend was suffering after awhile cause it was a bit too spicy for her. These crabs do not come with any sides so I had to order a fried rice on the side. Overall I think we spent $250 on lunch!

Teochew and Hokkien cooking really knows how to take seafood to the next level that you won't find anywhere else in the world. Behold, the famous Singaporean Chili/Black Pepper Crab! We ordered also the baby squid, taro scallop, Salted Egg Shrimp, and Pork alongside. A feast for a king for sure! Worth the money if you love high end bougie hearty stuff. This is located right by the Quay, so you get lovely scenery and the bar scene is super nice at night after you're done. Great pics of the skyline of Singapore from here as well. Pork: Goodness, ribs done to the next level. Savory, sweet, and covered with the satisfying almond crunch on top. Great way to kick off our meal Baby Squid: Taste of sweet sesame over crunchy but still slightly chewy squid. Baby squid is tender and having each individual squid per bite is so different from rings or calamari in my opinion. The texture and taste is sweet and naturally tender. Taro Scallop- If you love taro, then you gotta try Teochew or Singaporean version of taro. It is usually fried until aromatic paired with some coconut milk and gingko nuts at the end of a high end meal. This is to the next level- they deep fried it with these large succulent scallops in the middle. Holy cow. If this is not some delicious rich stuff, then idk what else is. Salted Egg Shrimp: Does this meal get  better or what? Salted egg is such a unique thing to Singapore- they even started a salted egg crusted fish skin as local potato chips which are also DELICIOUSLY sinful. Forget about popcorn shrimp- you use egg yolks as the crust?? Holy cow, my arteries are crying but in joy. Would do it again- salty, rich and not super crunchy and overly salty like a potato chip, this is a worth it dish to get. AND NOW.... the chili crab. Bro prepare to get your hands dirty, b/c the point of this dish is to finish that sauce that the crab has taken time to brew and stew in. The crab is delicious, but that chili paste that this thing has been cooking in is a complexly layered seafood chili thing that you must dip the sweet bun into. Better not leave any sauce left b/c it's worth like 1$ a bite on this dish and the sauce is EXCELLENT. Worth getting this. Take a stroll down Clarke's Quay afterwards for a neon lights reflecting on the water, chill bars, and the singapore Marina Sands Hotel reflecting across the waterways."

You eat the chilicrab with your hands and they provide bibs (like the crab/shrimp spot, Boiling Crab) as well as food grade gloves upon request.This place does fall into some tourist traps though: they come by to leave peanuts, but don't tell you that they will charge it on your bill,  you only have a limited time before you are ushered out to seat more guests, and the water is charged as well. (Though to be fair, it is bottle water). Flagging down a waiter to get anything was incredibly difficult where at one point, two tables next to us were waiting to get thier bill, trying to flag someone down as well.

They have other ways to prepare it, but we stuck with what Singapore is famous for. Singaporeans also consider this to be one of their national dishes. We also ordered the salted egg prawns. Our order came out pretty quickly. It was a nicely presented mud crab in a dish of chilli type sauce. The great news is that most of the crab is already pre-cracked and broken apart, making this much easier and quicker to eat. The flavor did not disappoint. It was a nice red sauce that had a slight heat mixed in with the sweet. If I had known better, I would have ordered some bread to soak up the sauce but we were so full we didn't need it.The salted egg prawn was delicious. It is basically a tempura shrimp dusted in some sort of sweet salt. It was delicious.

At first glance, it looks poppin'! They have an automated electronic queue system to handle the big lines at their doors. I was hopeful HOWEVERI have had chili crab before by the bay and others, and this was extremely disappointing. Presentation was good, the meal altogether was mediocre at best. You have to order the rice and fried buns, traditional sides chili crab comes with, a la carte? To me it didn't taste fresh. The fried shrimp was oddly a little soggy, and the crab was practically glued to the shell - something I've never experienced before. The taste was good but you are definitely better off getting crab by the bay - better pricing for WAY better food.It was very clear that they were understaffed, as the service was terrible. None of the food came out at the same time, the waiter kept forgetting what we asked for, and they don't have napkins? It took nearly 20 minutes after we ate for someone to come and clear the check. The interior was a mess. On the surface level, it looks clean and nice. However the front desk was loaded w a hodgepodge full of random stuff, trash was overflowing. Inside the storage for the restaurant was clearly visible. The bathroom was atrocious - and the only was to get though to it was through a hall behind the kitchen.

Heard about this popular place from a few local friends and decided to check it out. If you are planning to eat here, I highly recommend putting in reservations way beforehand. Once you get your RSVP secured, do make sure to show up on time or else you will lose your spot to the other hungry individuals who are waiting around and trying to get in without needing a RSVP.Once seated, it's time to put on some bibs and feast. Highly recommend ordering chili crab!! For a party of 3-4, one chili crab is enough to feed everyone. With the abundance of chili, I suggest getting a couple of side dishes since eating the crab itself isn't too filling if you're hungry. For the side dishes, I recommend getting the scallop appetizers plus rice or noodles. The scallop appetizers itself was a very unique dish. Crispy with taro on the outside and hot and soft on the inside, this is definitely yummy and different. As for the fried rice we got, it wasn't anything too stellar but it went well with the leftover chili once the crab meat was gone. We also ordered the recommended fried mini buns but found it to be quite underwhelming in comparison to most of the food that was ordered. NOTHING IS FREE, so do keep in mind that if you drink the tea on the table, or touch those small plates of peanuts, you will have to pay for it. Tricky tricky, I know. Even asking for water will equal to you paying for it. Service overall was quick and efficient. Every table has a time limit, so do observe the time. Also, this place does take credit card and can split bills which is a nice plus =]"

After reading that Jumbo Seafood was the place to try it I had to check it out. I wanted to go to Clarke Quay anyway and am glad I made the choice. They were lines of people waiting to be seated but the system was very organized and the wait was less than five minutes. I snagged a seat outside with views of the water. Service was excellent. The table was preset with peanuts (they charge you extra for this but don't tell you beforehand) Jasmine tea, and anything you could need for eating seafood. I Perused the menu but ultimately succumbed to the classic chili crab. First I started off with a glass of tiger beer. This was refreshing and a good way to cool off from the humidity outside.  I had my seafood eating bib, utensils, and disposable gloves (I had seen other diners using this and I am so glad that I requested them). My chili crab was brought out very shortly.  It was  everything it's been ""cracked up"" to be. The sauce was heavenly, The crab was super fresh.

This is all I eat here and will ever eat here because I can't get anything anywhere else that tastes as good as these dishes do here.If, like me, your companion doesn't eat seafood and is allergic to shellfish, there are limited options.That being said, I always get the Black Pepper crab. And I eat the whole thing! Sometimes I've had two, but they were pressed for the table so one had to do this time... This is by far the BEST Black Pepper crab you can get in Singapore. I've had Black Pepper crab in other restaurants (non-Jumbo). I have tried, White Pepper crab and nothing comes even close to the heavenly, yummy, deliciousness that is Black Pepper crab from Jumbo. I tried the Chili Crab, but for me the the Chili hides the taste of the crab, whereas the Black Pepper enhances it. In addition, the Chili crab is slightly sweet, which I don't like.Baby KaiLan in Garlic Sauce. OMG, so good! Cooked to the perfect tenderness and crunchiness. Not overly garlicky, in case you are concerned about that. My boyfriend had the Rib Eye with Black Pepper Sauce and he thought that while it wasn't your traditional au Poivre sauce, it was good, especially considering the options.Their house red wine is also pretty good. Don't hesitate.That's all folks. Honestly, this is a MUST if you visit Singapore. They have several other locations, in case Riverside Point is booked. If you go, book and book early to ensure your seat."

We sat outside under the cover of the canopy, so it was nice to see the water and lights around us as we ate. I would recommend refusing the tea and peanuts at the beginning of the meal if you don't want to pay for them. Skip all the extras like the seafood fried rice (overrated and overpriced) and get yourself a chili crab, a few fried mantous per person, and garlic baby bok choy. Pray that your food comes all at once and you're not devouring the veggies while waiting for your crab, and then waiting for the plain white rice when you're already 3/4 done with your crab.As for the chili crab, the sauce is just amazing! We paid about $88 SGD for a 1.3 kg crab. It can get messy, so just release your inhibitions, put on your bib, and dig in! The rice and fried buns are just vehicles to eat as much of the delicious sauce as possible. If I had no shame, I would've taken the leftover sauce home with us.

It was a bit spicy for my liking to enjoy it fully. The price for two crabs and a can of soda, came out to about $150 US dollars.

We came to this particular JUMBO seafood since it was closest to our hotel. Based on recommendations from other fellow travelers, we came here specifically for the Chilli Crab. When we arrived we were seated right away and during the chaos of being seated WHILE they were getting the table ready, they offered tea along with peanuts (we later found out tea was 2 SGD per person and peanuts were also 2SGD) and was never communicated to us they were for a charge. While we were there, service was soso, tea was rarely refilled and we had to flag down our waiter to place our order. We also had to flag down our server for the bill and it took about 20min for our credit card to be returned to us. I understand it's an extremely busy restaurant but for what they charge, I'd expect more attentiveness in terms of service.

Expect to order a selection of smaller dishes, and one or two bigger ones if you're in a party. Although , to be honest, I'd say on our visit the food was hit and miss, there is plenty to tempt here, and a very real danger of grossly overordering. Hits included baby squid and a surprisingly gamey Peking duck; misses included salted egg shrimp ( undercooked batter, more akin to unfinished scrambled egg) and scallop and yam fritters ( strangely boring pucks of brown matter around soft and tasteless scallops).

We were lucky we did not have to wait for a table as we were open to sharing a round table with 4 other strangers. We were there for good crab so didn't care. We ordered one chili crab and 4 mantous (fried bread for dipping the delicious sauce) and a small order of cereal prawns split between two people. It was more than enough for us as we ate it all. Although we might have been able to eat more but we were sitting outside and it was hot, humid, uncomfortable and definitely changed our usual appetites. We had previously asked if we could sit indoors and still share tables but the waitress said no.The chili crab was so good! It was sweet with a kick. Normally I can't handle spice and I might have been struggling with my mouth feeling like it was on fire but the crab was too good to pass up. However for people who can handle spice, this will be nothing for you. Mantous were perfect for dipping in the chili crab sauce! The cereal prawns were good but by then I was getting so stuffed that I did not enjoy as much. Food was good but my complaints are just that the service was not good, they are not attentive nor friendly. They nickel and dime you for everything including the ""peanuts and tea"" they place on the table for their customers. They should really not give peanuts unless it is requested because tourists or non-regulars will not be aware and see that their are additional charges on their bill. Just seems sneaky and shady."

Service is poor. On our recent visit, the server kept coming over to take away empty, or not quite empty, dishes on the table one by one -- great way to make sure your guests get annoyed and leave within minutes, I reckon. Expensive. We spent S$200 on a dinner for three, including one black pepper crab, some seafood tofu dish that tasted a bit off, a vegetable dish, rice and a jug of Tiger beer.

Of course you have to get chili crab. Don't forget the wee fried buns to dip in the chili sauce- that's half the fun. I know this place is famous for the crab but I love the pumpkin shrimp. It's full of flavor and has crisp veggies underneath. It's easily my favorite dish here. The salted egg shrimp are good too. If your group is big enough order the whole duck. They prepare it table side. The crispy skin is removed and sliced then rolled in cigars. The rest is chopped and served on a platter. The flavor is great - deep and smokey.

I grew up in Maryland, we eat crab. We cover it it old bay. We wear bibs and use full rolls of paper towels. But this is different. It comes in skillets, it's spicier, it comes with sides and chili crab sauce. You still use a full roll of paper towels but it's a fancier, Singaporean experience that shouldn't be missed.

This is because Jumbo is located in easy to access areas for tourists, including this branch directly opposite Clarke Quay, so you'll have a great view of Clarke Quay especially at night. Every time I have guests in town, I will try bringing them here, or to the Dempsey outlet,... etc. One of the reasons is because overall the food is decent and the price is more attractive than it's upper-tier competitors.The unfortunate part is that since this location is immensely popular with tourists, you will have to reserve seats at least two days in advance especially for the weekend dinners! Some bright spark food reviewer from Japan and Korea wrote about Jumbo in their travel guidebooks, therefore you will always find Japanese and Korean tourists swarming in lines for the tasty crab.Recommendations: Chilli crab (of course) together with the mantou (fried buns - at least 2 per pax recommended) to dip into the succulent chilli sauce, bamboo clams, tofu with seaweed.Tips: You can choose which crab! Choose the normal ones (it's already big enough!), so you don't have to choose the Alasakan ones which will cost you a bomb.Oh yes - this being a Chinese restaurant, don't expect the service to be good.

By small I meant somewhere around 1kg, most crabs are approximately 1.5kg. Well, the chili crab's sauce was awesome but the crabmeat was lackluster, I much preferred the black pepper crabmeat which was pretty tasty. Unfortunately, my otherwise rather pleasant experience was the ruined by Jumbo's shady business practices. First up, a Chinese family beside me was almost duped into buying(wasting) an Alaskan crab on a chili crab dish. Luckily they asked for the prices and declined when it was $500+. They settled on the standard crabs. After they left, a Korean couple took their place at the table beside mine; as they were browsing through the menu, I gave them a few tips on which crabs to order(to prevent a repeat of the Alaskan ripoff). When the manager came over to take their order, I just couldn't believe my ears: he recommended they grab two freaking crabs each. That's just not right! I jumped in and told these innocent tourists to grab one to share and then another if it's not enough. The manager gave me the evil eye and proceeded to explain that some people could eat two crabs...  Bullshit, the smallest crabs are at least 1kg(2.2lbs). And these folks ordered side dishes too.Since this business allows such unscrupulous upselling, it makes one wonder if they're an ethical business ...if the crabs bought were fresh... if they were actually 1.1kg... if they were from the same crab or dead pieces from various crabs... I have no answer except this restaurant ain't worth it. I'm paying $250 for a meal of two. I want unquestionable good crabs, service and business practices to boot. Folks, search for ""No Signboard"" seafood restaurant at Geylang on Yelp if you want awesome crabs with huge bang for your buck. You're welcome ~"

Seating is mostly outside with just a couple of tables inside. The menu is simple with Fish and Chips being the main feature although there are some other alternatives to the fish. We ordered a Dory and Chips and a Halibut and Chips. Drinks were a bottle of craft cider from the UK, (cannot remember the name) and a pint of their draft Catch ale.  Service was very friendly and prompt with the drinks coming out fast followed by the food. After seeing the food quality go downhill at one of the premium fish and chip restaurants over at Bukit Timah, we were eager to find an alternative source of our much loved Fish and Chips. We need not have worried. The chips were not so traditional, but similar to the French fries in many restaurants everywhere. Lightly spiced, and well cooked. The fish which was cooked in English Beer Batter (you do get a choice of this or Japanese breadcrumbs or spicy) was nicely served and cooked very well with the right amount of crispiness. Fish was very nicely cooked with the halibut having the edge in terms of flavor over the dory. Cod was also on the menu. It has only been open a couple of months, but we will be back for sure and if they maintain the quality, it should be a big success."

It was a tomato based one so not a proper Russian one but it was very tasty and savoury. The meat was small tough pieces but they had thick cabbage inside that made it so wholesome. The toast is a thick soft one that had a nice char to it. We ordered another. Noodles were springy. Classic but they did a good rendition. Soup was a fish base white soup.Beef brisket had really tender beef. The gravy was unctuous. Condensed milk buns were good and we ripped the up to share. Better with the tea. Tea was thick and served unsweetened but I think you need to add a little sugar to bring it the full flavour.Abalone fried rice had unique taste and my brothers were talking about eating it again... So much so we are here again and actually queueing now as I type this. Prices were fair. The sweet and sour pork was normal but a good portion.

We ordered their signature milk tea and signature condensed milk bun. Milk tea was not as smooth as the one in Hong Kong. The bun was just as good. We also ordered the Western fried rice bet you did not know westerners had fried rice LOL. It was as tasty as the one we had in Hong Kong. We also got the pork chop grilled rice which was good with large chunk of pork chop. Also ordered the wanton noodle, it was ok but not as good as in Hong Kong. Overall food is good. Service is quick. Food came quick but does not feel pre-prepared. Menu was not as large as the one in Hong Kong. Will come again."

One of my friends didn't care for spicy food and most dishes have a decent amount of heat, so be sure to make a special request if you like your dishes more mild.Ras' outside seating was lovely - the tables were covered and well lit. The dining area inside felt a little more cramped, but why sit inside on a beautiful, warm night? The servers were experienced and attentive, and the drink specials were pretty good, too (a decent price for a pitcher of beer)! I really can't say enough good things about this place."

We were excited to see there was one in Singapore...Our food was fine. My cocktail was $13.90 and wasn't even filled to the top of the glass and didn't taste quite right... the service was average. There were no quirky Hooter wet wipes (moist towelettes) with sayings on them. Oh and water - I asked for some water for the table and was told they didn't do any, and that I had to pay for it. Where is the responsible service of alcohol? I paid for a bottle, but that seems irresponsible when you are selling 2L beer towers, cocktails and other alcoholic beverages. The free wifi had a weak signal and apps wouldn't load quickly or stay connected. Our meal came to $71.70. It was over priced for average food and below average service. When we went to pay, the girl looked at us continued what she was doing and then left the counter. She came back, we got our bill and paid for it, (no how was your meal? Or any other general chatter or conversation) and then she walked away. I waiting for my change. We weren't sure if she was coming back or if she thought it was a tip.

Lunch in the middle of the week is pretty quiet, though. I looked through their lunch specials but I just thought they were weird. I know they have to cater to the local crowd, but a part of me thinks it's strange to order prawn spaghetti from Hooters, of all places. But if you like that stuff, you're in luck, as $10 will get you an entree, soft drink and ice cream. And if you want beer with that, it will only be an extra $5!I was craving their wings so I ordered 10 of 'em. Still as good as I remembered it. And to remind myself I'm in Singapore, I made sure to have a Tiger beer to go along with it.The girls are cute, all Asian (of course) and none of them have muffin tops.

But a friend who is one of the most demure people I know told me to give the fried pickles a try, so I finally did once as a before-beer-snack. HOOKED. Perfectly hot salty and crispy bite-sized pieces, with a juicy sliced pickle encased inside. There isn't any tangy taste like those we scrape out from our cheeseburgers, but there is still the unmistakable pickled cucumber taste. Goes perfect with an Erdinger and soccer on the TVs! Many happy and contented night has since been spent at Hooters with the boyfriend cheering for our team. Do try their Buffalo Wings too! Comes in a range of spiciness levels, but we recommend the Hot. Just don't inhale too close to the fumes, they add vinegar to the batter sauce - a potent mix!"

We like a mixture of wings and drumlets, but your preference might differ. That's pretty much all I eat at Hooters, really, those and the deep fried pickle chips. Strange before I ever tried one, but they really are addictive. They also do set lunches for the office crowd, but it feels a bit wrong that a place known for their wings don't put them on the set lunch menu?"

It depends though how you like your buffalo wings. If you're a fan of the barbequed ones, this one's not for you. Hooter's wings are deep fried and lathered with a tangy buffalo sauce. You can get blue cheese dressing (my favourite) as your dip. It's pretty pricey for such wings but sometimes when you have the kind of craving that makes the corners of your mouth sweat for some spicy tangy buffalo wings, you can't go wrong with hooter's.They have set lunches that go from as low as $10 for a main course, drink and a scoop of ice-cream.

(Google it) Normally, I would never in my wildest dream order that cut. Tenderloin is known for its tenderness, but it's lacking on marbling and fat. However, in a Japanese beef, the tenderness is retained while still possessing just the right amount of marble-ness. The result was outstanding, probably one of the best Japanese-style steaks you can have anywhere in the world.I don't usually care about price, but I have to take 1 star from Yazawa here because I think it's ridiculously expensive. The chateaubriand was just 150 or 200 grams (can't remember) and it costs $200++. You should still try it at least once in a lifetime though."

One night I got ambitious and ordered the streak, top 5 all time. Yes, that good.  Comes pre-cut so you can use chop sticks.  Comes with a small side of seasoning, but honestly speaking it doesn't need it.  Melts in your mouth.  Staff is friendly and attentive, and I think by now they recognize me but I can't tell for sure because they show everyone the same amount of attention and respect.  If you feel like drinking you can also visit Orihara Shoten next door for some top notch sake.     The bad:  Price is high, and other items on the menu are just above average.  Never had a bad dish, but I have high expectations when a premium is charged.  The ugly:  The atmosphere/decor is lacking.  It's made up of high booth seats and a private room to the side.  The kitchen is glass, but you can't really see from your seat, only when you're walking in/out.  I prefer the setup at Fat Cow, so I wish Masa would revamp to make it more open and friendly to smaller groups.  If it did, this place could be a homerun, but for now it's just a go-to for mind blowing beef."

This restaurant seems popular with locals, not a touristy spot. We were definitely the only tourists here during our lunch visit. Reservations are suggested but since we walked in and they weren't as busy, we were able to get a seat. Bathrooms are not air conditioned so be prepared to leave the A/C restaurant and step in to a humid hallway leading to the single stall restrooms.

Yazawa is easily the number one spot in Singapore to satisfy your yakiniku cravings. Although its abit pricey, the quality of the beef easily makes up for the cost. YES, it is that worth it and YES, it is THAT good. Never did I expect to eat yakiniku of this quality in Singapore. It's just as good as the ones in Japan. Worth to go during special occasions and a definite must try.My family of 3 paid about 160 per pax for about 7 different servings of beef together with one soup and a salad. Trust me, it is not recommended that you order too much meat, as the meat is very savory and will get very 'gelat' if too much of it is eaten. Aim to order about 120-130 per pax. Food such as this is best enjoyed in smaller quantities.I highly recommend ordering the wagyu steak and at least 2 servings of it. Its easily the best dish of meat you can get there. The level of marbling on the steak is truly amazing. The words 'it literally melts in your mouth' holds very true here. The last time i had such an experience was with fatty tuna belly in Tuskiji fish market all the way in japan. Aside from that, the dish i recommend would be my personal favorite, ox tongue! The meat is both chewy and soft at the same time, giving it a unique texture which i really enjoy."

We got there right at the time of our reservation, we were asked to wait, and after some time we are told that because they have too many reservations they are giving us a table in their other restaurant next door (Masa) where we could order of of their menu. We go to the place next door, and again we are asked to wait. This time, slight better, because they invite us to seat at the bar to wait... The bar attendant stares at us and ignores us... Even after we greet her. Guess what we want, you genius?  Ask yourself what do people at the bar usually do... Manage to order two beers somehow. We are seated. The table setup is awkward. It's one of those typical, nice Japanese private booth. But it split in two right in the middle with a flimsy curtain, which lets you see through some and lets you hear everything happening at the other side or the table--not hard, since they are seating inches from you...The appetizers are typical Japanese, but ruined by some Chinese influence.  For example, classic Japanese chilled tofu with soy, and addition of deep fried onion on top, just to mention one. The meat is awesome, and that's the only reason to come to this place. Not cheap, definitely.  Everything, but the meat, will take ages, so be prepared..."

It's as expensive as having a meal at Cut or Mortons. But I have to say that the quality is just as good or even better. Yakiniku they call it - this was my first time having it. I ordered the Yukke to share as appetiser. Aesthetically it is an automatically eye pleaser! It's hard not to whip out your hp just to take a picture of this beauty! It's raw marinated beef with a perfect yolk in the centre. It tasted very fresh and was the gateway for more great things to come! At this point of time we started to get even more hungry! The waitress was pretty helpful and patient in explaining and recommending the different cuts for us. In the end we settled for Zabuton (short rib), Jo Kalbi, Tenderloin, and beef tongue. I'll admit it.. I enjoyed them all! I love beef. The colours of the marbling even before it's cooked is enough to send you to cloud 9! As you place it on the grill for only a few seconds, you can see how the fat bubbles off the meat and melts and cooks so evenly! BOOM. It's like heaven in your mouth. Being a guy, I also need my rice! And the rice here for 3bucks a bowl was definitely worth mentioning. Good quality indeed!The waitress will also come by quite a number of time to change your grill to a new one too! Very impressed with that! Being my first time here with really good meat, I didn't try much of the sauces as I really wanted to take in all that bovine goodness! But I can tell you that even if you used any... U really didn't need to use any of the condiments much at all! If it weren't so expensive... Id give it a full 5stars! But I can at least see why it costs so much. I think maybe I've found a new place to come to instead of the usual Cut or Mortons if I'm craving really high quality steak. Definitely not a place you'd come every other month for people like me but if you enjoy your beef or wanna impress a chick who loves beef for her birthday or a special occasion... THIS WILL NOT DISAPPOINT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Oh and I just remember one slight grievance... They do tend to seem like they're rushing you out a bit the minute u finish everything and don't seem to be ordering anymore. I think they could improve a bit more on that to try to at least be a little more discreet given that I spent practically $200 per person in the span of under 90mins!"

It's probably my favorite yakiniku place in Singapore. They serve beef of amazing quality, and great side dishes as well.I usually start with a cold chicken ramen. It's nothing like your usual ramen. The noodles is not the usual yellow egg noodle, but it's some sort of jelly-like, chewy noodle. The broth is light, topped with sesame oil & seeds. And instead of chasiu, you have this sliced chicken thigh instead. The combination sounds weird at first, but it's very refreshing and just arouses your appetite for the beef.As said above, the beef that Yazawa serves are of the highest quality. My favorite cut is the Japanese beef shoulder. It is very rare and you should call the shop days in advance to reserve it. They also have the Australian beef version, and while it's decent, it just won't blow your brain like the Jap version. Other than that, the thick beef tongue is just wonderful.Tbh, the other beef that Yazawa serves is great, but it's just not as good as those 2 cuts I mentioned. But you won't be disappointed with the overall yakiniku experience you'll enjoy in Yazawa."

Unlike Aburiya, Gyu Kaku or Ito-Kacho, there isn't a variety of seafood, or vegetables to break up the monotony of regular meats like beef, pork and chicken. Most meats are marinated with tare, or shio. I personally prefer tare seasoning, it's got a little more dimension than just salt & pepper.There's just 2 types of beef, all wagyu of course, of Australian breed, or the in-house proprietary brand Yazawa beef. The Australian wagyu is a little more tempered, whereas the Yazawa beef is extremely marbled. If you prefer your meats with a little more body, I suggest you take the Australian wagyu over the very rich Yazawa beef.Note that there's a 2-seatings for dinner policy, which the service staff will inform about when taking reservations, and/or also while seating u. On the upside: service was akin to a Korean-style barbecue, where u needn't bother with the grilling because the wait staff will be on hand to do so.We had:1) Edamame ($8): ridiculously expensive, but they were fat and juicy, beautifully seasoned with sea salt, and served refreshingly icy.2) Tori Momoniku ($16): bite-sized morsels of juicy chicken thigh marinated in tare sauce. Must-try.3) Mangalica Pork ($22): delicious slivers of chuck roll simply seasoned with shio (salt) & pepper so as not to detract from the natural sweetness of the meat4) Ton Toro ($16): medium-thick cuts of pork neck glazed with tare. These were so awesome, we had like 5 plates between the 3 of us. For sure a cannot-miss.5) Australian Wagyu Jo Kalbi ($28): premium chuck rib cut, steeped in tare. This had a fuller flavour, while exquisite threads of fat lent succulence.6) Yazawa Beef Misuji ($48): an exceptional precious cut at the corner of the shoulder, mostly because it was more fat than meat. This was glorious and indulgent and sinfully rich.7) Yazawa Beef Rump ($46): a smidge more delicate in marbling, so while it was decadent, it wasn't as heart-palpitatingly so"

Good selection of steaks both in terms of cut and from USA, Australia and Ireland!  Normally more of a ribeye than a sirloin person, the Irish Grass Fed Sirloin is well worth trying, as are the Grain Fed ribeye.

Since I don't normally see wagyu on menus, I decided to give it a shot. The wagyu special came with ""truffle"" fries and a wine or beer for $73 ($54 USD). The steak wasn't terrible, but it was on the salty side. I love anything truffle, so I was getting my hopes up on the fries. Unfortunately, these weren't house cut fries, and I couldn't taste any hint of truffle on the fries.

We started off with the New England Clam Chowder, which as natives of Boston, we are always skeptical of ordering outside my hometown, but Chef Manuel Gruber has an interesting take on this Boston classic, piling in a hearty portion of New Zealand mussels and bacon bits to give it a flavor all its own.When it comes to the meat, our cut is almost always the intricately marbled US Black Angus Rib-Eye cooked medium rare (closer to rare) sprinkled with a bit of salt to lock in the full flavor of the meat.  For the sides, you can't go wrong with Creamed Spinach or Grilled Green Asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce and either the Potatoes Gratin or Mashed Potatoes as welcome accompaniments.If you've saved up enough room for dessert, then we recommend diving into the White & Dark Mocca Mousse, which is a delightful set of flavors that nicely balance off the salty meat flavor from earlier.

Is that possible??5) Help yourself to the condiment bar. There are about 20 different types to mix up yourself or follow the recommended combinations on the wall for those who need some guidance. Warning, I find the spicy chilli really spicy so I only add a little of that now.6) The mushroom stock soup. It's made from old mushrooms and really savoury.7) The rice here seems to be good quality and better than your average restaurant. Really tasty somehow with the food.8) They make their own pork balls9) There's decent air conditioning!"

We were ignored for the rest of the time. This meal was my treat to my son... I was actually embarrassed by our shabby treatment.

The seating is outside next to the river which was very nice. The only thing I didn't like was a lack of a restroom.

The carnitas and el pastor are great. Their habaneros and cream salsa is also great and reminds me of a great mexican place back in LA. This one  is basically a taco stand with a much more limited menu.  If you want a bigger menu try the chimes or star vista branch.  Its a great spot for some solid food at a reasonable price.

I found the quality of food and service to be average. Coming from LA I do admit that I set a high bar for Mexican food. We ordered the chips with guacamole (probably the best dish of the meal), tacos (which were not bad but should come in smaller sizes in stead of one single huge tortilla), enchiladas, salad (which I do NOT recommend). Drinks were A-OK :)One thing I have to say about the service: They cleared our plates even when we said no... Which was a huge turn off. It is not like there were people queueing so I just didn't understand the rush.All in all it's probably worth a visit, just one though unless food quality goes up."

In a country where great food from all walks of life is fairly easy to find, my one criticism would be trying to locate a decent Mexican joint with traditional tacos. I had a hunch that Singapore would probably not have many options for Mexican, seeing as the countries are miles apart. I knew after moving from the states that I would have to curb my Mexican cravings, which I've learned to manage since Singapore offers other great varieties of food. At one point though, I hit a wall and needed a taco fix. After searching high and low, I did manage to find a place that I can somewhat rely on now when I need a taco fix. Senor taco in Clark Quay offers decent tacos. Granted, I have had way better in my life, but again, I'm in Singapore and I knew I had to curb my expectations a bit. The beef and pork tacos are nice, and the different hot sauces they offered were quite decent. The service was nothing to brag about, but I wasn't expecting top notch service at a place like this. The only drawback was the loud music they felt they needed to blast. I enjoy my fair share of hip-hop, but I don't think you need to blast it as loud as possible on a Tuesday evening. Also, if you have kids, it might be best not to bring them here as they don't play the ""clean"" versions of these songs. If you don't care that your young ones are exposed to explicit lyrics, then it won't be a problem. The tacos at the Orchard location were actually tastier and the service was great there. They also didn't blast the music to the point where your ears felt like bleeding. The only drawback there is it's right behind Orchard Towers, and well, I don't really need to explain what you'll see there while dining at the location."

The corn tortillas are authentic but are a little on the dry side. Same for the marinated pork/chicken. The meat was overcooked and rather dry. However, the sauces are definitely authentic.Perusing the menu, there were also a couple of authentic-looking central Mexican dishes that looked good to try, but I didn't get the opportunity on this visit. I saw enchiladas, sopas, quesadillas. The menu is available on the website.One problem is the atmosphere, where they played mostly outdated 90s and 00s house and pop music at ear-splittingly loud levels even on an empty mid-week night...Quality and taste-wise, the tacos are okay, bordering on meh.

Unfortunately the prices are a bit high for what it is, both the food and the drinks. Sure their location in Clark Quay is convenient and the live stage along with occasional salsa inside the restaurant make this place fun but my fore mentioned favorite steak taco is $10 for a single taco and overall from my experience you need to spend $40-60 dollars, excluding drinks to get full here. The drinks are also pricy and the jug of margaritas will be $50 or so. Sure the food is good but the value is barely average."

Tacos are authentic -- corn tortillas with meat, extra for cheese. Topped with cilantro and onions. What I like most is they bottles of sauce (chipotle sauce, guacomole sauce, super spicy, etc). Considering that guacamole is very expensive in Singapore, I just drown my tacos in the green guacamole sauce.

Seating is bar-like, with people perched on high-standing stools along similarly elevated tables. Upon our arrival, one of the chefs came out to take our order, and he told us about the place, including the fact that this is the first taqueria in Asia. I tend to take all such claims with a healthy pinch of salt, but I'll accept that all other Mexican outlets I have come across do tend to sell more than just tacos! Tacos were quite cheap at between $2.50 and $3.50 a taco, with fillings including grilled pork and beef. Quesadillas were also available, and cost between $4.50 and $5, depending on the fillings. I had a grilled pork taco and a beef taco, and that turned out to be too little for me. The tacos could be devoured in three bites! The pork was delicious and the beef was a little on the dry side. So I ended up ordering a vegetarian quesadilla to supplement my order, and the tortilla was nice and soft, and the cheese not too overwhelming. I also had a strawberry magarita ($20) here. You have two options: a double shot or a double double shot of tequila. Yes, that means four shots. I opted for the single double, and that in itself was pretty strong. Thanks, you've successfully added this place! Señor Taco isn't the best place I've ever had Mexican food, but it is very reasonably priced, considering I had a decent meal and drink for about $30. It's not a great place to sit if you're dying from the Singapore heat, but, if you're used to it, it's definitely a more affordable alternative compared to the neighbouring outlets."

You can watch your sever preparing your taco and it's fuss free and quick.

There is a decent selection to choose from. A man was making fresh dosa (original, butter, and masala flavors) which was delicious. I thought the lassi drink (ask the server for this) and the aloo shimla were really good as well. Nothing in the buffet was super spicy which was a good thing for me because I typically don't tolerate spice that well. The only dish that I felt came a little short was the chana simla, I thought that was a bit bland. Most of the dining room will consist of Indian people.

They should wash the tablecloths; it's rather unsavory to see them flick away the food crumbs from a table then seat the next guests.

However the management was fairly rude - as soon as we entered an elderly lady asked us if we had reservation and since we didn't have one she gave a discourse on how we should have a reservation on weekends and that too when 50% of the restaurant was empty!! We still wanted to try the food and hence sat down..the food was just about decent. The moong dal and the potato curry was good but the rest of the food was just average. The management definitely needs some lesson on hospitality! The only good thing is that they let the customer decide the price depending on how satisfied you are.

Was afraid that it would be a different experience at the new outlet but my fears were unfounded! The decor remains as beautifully intricate and this outlet is definitely much brighter than the previous and also much bigger too. One of the best thing about this place is that its a pay-as-you-wish indian vegetarian restaurant - its run by volunteers and the money you pay at the end of your meal goes towards an organization that cultivates Indian arts and cultural development - it sounds like the perfect arrangement. You may wonder how they keep the business running by letting customers pay however much they like but you'd be surprised how much people can feel generous after a good meal!It has a good selection of vegetarian Indian food from rice to poori to naan to oothapam and a few types of vadai. The drinks also have a good selection, the mango lassi is one my faves and I like to end my meals with a nice hot cup of spiced masala tea. If you come on friday and weekends, it's a buffet for lunch and dinner - not a bad selection but limited to only whats on the buffet table. Come for dinner on mon to thursdays to have the best selection of food from the menu.Final verdict: One of the best feel-good restaurants- good food, good ambience and all for a good cause!"

It is one of the best places to find Indian vegetarian food in Singapore. This place is very interesting as it is run totally by volunteers and patrons pay what they like. They either have a full buffet or ala carte and everything is fresh and very good. You can order a selection of drinks like lassi or chai masala tea. It can get pretty crowded here sometimes so it is a good idea to make a reservation. The staff are all volunteers and sometimes they can be a bit grumpy.

I was so mad when I went into the main room, we ate outside, and saw the beautiful aged beef. It was on the menu, but I somehow had my eye on the ribeye. Next time. The service was excellent.

My friends really enjoyed the chicken and rice, which looked about as authentic of a dish as you could get. Not much ambiance here. Just plop down at a table (hopefully near one of those portable air conditioners) order a few ice cold Tiger beers, and then have at the menu. Definitely the kind of place for an adventurous eater.

Felt very authentic and I was glad to pay the bill when it arrived. I also tipped a few bucks and I think the server was genuinely surprised to receive anything- I think the culture here does not tip? I still did some nominal tipping where I went...felt like something right to do. They offer a lot of sides and other items you can eat here- probably nice if you had a group so you can share.

Ooh La la.It's official, Keisuke Ramen has officially taken over Singapore and has now become one of if not the number one chain of Ramen restaurants in Singapore! While I haven't been overly impressed with Tendon, their Tempura bowl restaurant, I really haven't had much to complain about their ramen restaurants. Though I haven't tried, Tonkotsu King and Orchid Hotel looks an ever popular ""to-go-restaurant"", their restaurant at Suntec has been good too and the Crab broth is a delight and now, Lobster King at Clarke Quay is making waves! We finally managed to bring ourselves down to Lobster King to give it a shot and we were not disappointed. Located at the heart of Clarke Quay (and right next to the soon to be re-located Zouk), Lobster King's rich lobster broth ramen has to be the ultimate hangover food. In terms of variety? Not much, with only the option of thick broth, light broth, Miso or spicy Miso. However, don't let the lack of options turn you away because what they do well is a delicious bowl of ramen. With the option of either without flavoured egg (Ajisuke Tomago), with egg or extra ingredients, we went without the egg, solely because the restaurant gives you free hard boiled eggs. YES! FREE! Oh, that and free bean sprouts as well. So we went with the trademark... Lobster Broth Ramen with Rich Creamy Broth The broth is definitely rich and definitely very tasty! Served with a good amount of Leak, a piece of torched pork, a piece of chicken and a dumpling,  this dish definitely hit the mark. The first thing we noticed was the noodles. Unlike other ramen joints, the noodle seemed different. Judging from the texture and look, we figured that it was probably a buck wheat or whole wheat mix, which works perfectly well with this broth as it allowed the broth to coat the noodle without soaking it fully, which may have made it over powering. The leak helped add balance to the dish, giving it a bit of pungent-ness to help cut the richness. The pork, which tender and juicy, got a bit lost in the dish for me, thanks to the broth but the chicken was surprisingly good. It was tender, juicy and the texture felt like it had been sous vide. The dumpling was a nice surprise.He skin tasted a little Gyoza-ish but thicker and it helped soak in the stock. The prawn they stuffed in it was nice and sweet too, bringing out the ""lobster-ness"" of the dish. On a side note, do note that the broth might be overpowering and salty so if an overly rich broth isn't for you, I would suggest the much lighter looking clear broth instead. Oh yes.... And please note that although the name is Lobster King, don't be disappointed when you find out that the lobster is in the broth and you don't get a fat piece of Lobster Tail in the ramen, but than again, at $14.90, I suppose that's expected. Overall, we do like it a lot. May be a little too rich to have it often but when we do crave the rich broth and can get away from the standard pork broth, we will be back!"

And lobster bisque is a traditional French dish. Anyway, the coming together of these influences works quite well. Toppings of chicken, dumpling and char siu were generous. But in my opinion, the broth gets too cloyingly rich and salty after a few mouthfuls. It needed a few dashes of vinegar to enliven the heavy richness. Also, it could do without the heavy hit of MSG. After all, lobster shells should lend enough umami to the broth. I was thirsty halfway through the bowl, and so were my table mates.

Was not disappointed with the delicious thick collagen broth. The set came with good portions of fresh ingredients including chicken and prawns, was particularly intrigued by the watermelon radish that gave the meal a beautiful presentation. The broth was incredible - tasty with natural flavors of the ingredients rather than seasoning, and we could really see how potently concentrated the soup was with it slowly solidifying back into its jelly form when removed from the heat source. Pity the set meal only allowed a one time top up of the soup, and additional soup would be charged more. It's understandable I guess, given probably a limited supply with a lot of work to cooking it. Not a cheap meal certainly, but an enjoyable one as a whole!"

Eat Me immediately strikes as a simple salad bar or vegetarian restaurant, mainly because of their tagline ""Lettuce satisfy you"" (pun fully intended, I think). Fortunately, it's more than that.While vegetarian and vegan restaurants resort to preaching about how unhealthy, foolish and downright evil it is to eat any kind of animal product, Eat Me focuses on taste, freshness and balance. They don't eradicate meat or animal protein from their menu. Instead, they use it in sensible portions, as a complement to fresh veggies, just as your nutritionist surely told you to do. Another good thing is they emphasise the use of local and organic products. Vegetables are always fresh, and if combined with a bit of egg, duck, fish or beef, there's no way they can go wrong.Eat Me's salads are delightful, and so are their very own cold-pressed juices. The make-your-own baked potatoes look tasty, but I have to try them yet. The star for me (and for many other customers, it seems)  is the Hulk Toast: a flavourful omelette served over a thick slice of wholegrain bread with heavenly avocado, cherry tomatoes and sesame seeds. I'm not a big fan of omelettes myself, but this is fantastically well done. It has become my favourite local breakfast. Coffee is provided by the famous Sarnies. It's not the best, but it's certainly superior than what can be found at UE Square.Among the overpriced bars, franchise coffee shops and fancy places around UE Square, Eat Me shines for their healthy, honest, unpretentious and appetising food. It is truly refreshing to have a local restaurant that serves healthy food that sells itself on taste, with no need for preaching. I'm a big fan already.Curious fact: they managed to get rid of the burnt fat smell that loomed in the kopitiam that was there before. That alone is a reason to admire them."

However, the star of the night, the ramen noodles and soup itself, was a disappointment and having tried favourites like Santouka and Nantsuttei, I feel that Marutama is just not up to par. The soup, being chicken-based, lacks the thick flavourful consistency that pork-based soups provide and doesn't pack a punch. The noodles were stringy and felt sadly like the noodles I get from instant ramen that can be purchased at Medi-ya Supermarket.Still, one thing I did enjoy, immensely, was the boiled Tamago, which is the best I have had at a local ramen place. With solid egg whites browned from soaking overnight in flavoured vinegar and a molten yolk inside, Marutama definitely puts alot of effort into a dish many cannot master and this was the star of the evening.

Definitely younger because I remember going there before my brother was born. So since I was 6 then. From Swensen's and Daimaru to ramen, sushi, and CREAM PUFFS, Liang Court has been a firm fixture on my list of ""malls that I think of fondly"". Meidi Ya in the basement has one of the best juice/smoothie selections I ever seen (they have Innocent smoothies! YUM!)And I haven't even talked about the McDonalds that's open 24 hours for the drunken bodies staggering over from Clarke Quay (yeah been there, done that more than once).Quite simply, Liang Court isn't as flashy as those new fangled malls, nor as simple as those heartland malls, but she's classy in her own way. As long as she's perched on the edge of prime drinking areas, and continues to draw in the Japanese expats, she'll be here to stay.So stay classy Liang Court, stay classy."

It came recommended by an Iranian friend when I mentioned that we were looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant. It's a little on the pricey side, so we waited till a special occasion -- a birthday. When I called to make a reservation, the restaurant offered to have the belly dancer bring out the cake, which I thought was really nice of them. The restaurant was empty when we arrived at 7pm, but it was full by 8pm. This was a Sunday by the way. I found the menu overwhelming, despite being semi-comfortable in most Middle Eastern restaurants.  I think it was the use of Turkish names that were non-familiar -- for instance there were two eggplants dishes that were not baba ganoush on the appetizers. I think it would have been helpful to have sorted the main dishes by type of meat, and also add a short English description in the title (not in the long detailed description), but the restaurant's been around so I'm sure they know what they are doing. Part of the menu is reserved for halal food.We chickened out, and ordered a platter for 4, the vegetarian option and a lamb stew. The appetizer list was shorter, and we went with both eggplant dishes, hummus and the lamb meatballs. The appetizers were awesome, especially the bread. We had three orders of bread, and they were complimentary...although we did order 4 appetizers. I'm not sure if they eventually charge for bread. After the appetizers, we were starting to feel kind of full. Oh, we were a party of 7.The main platter was huge -- definitely more than enough food for 4 people. I think we could have just gotten the platter for our party of 7. It came with a couple of roasted tomatoes and a few slices of carrots, so it was a good idea to add the vegetarian main to our dinner. The grilled vegetables were interesting -- there were the usual bell peppers, zucchini and potatoes, and then more. Roasted celery! Roasted lotus root! They were actually really good! The meat platter was done well, but I didn't find any of the food remarkable.The belly dancer came out after 8:30pm, and started dancing in the restaurant. The arrangement of the tables made it hard to properly see her dancing. After the first song, she danced outside the restaurant at the front door for 2 more songs, which we couldn't quite see. If you're here to see the belly dancer, you're better off waiting outside.The restaurant felt a little understaffed. It took a while for them to clear the plates, and a lot longer to bring out the dishes after the belly dancer gave us the cake. However, the wait staff was very friendly. We definitely had a great time."

One of them is friends with one of the dancers as well.Staff were helpful in suggesting the right options and amounts of food for 9 hungry carnivores and 1 vegetarian. A couple of their sample platters and few sides, with some nibbles of mezze and hummus before, were just right to ensure we were left fat and happy. All the food was excellently prepared and presented, with a mix of lamb, beef, and fish.Service was very quick, the wine we ordered was always topped up when needed, and we genuinely felt very well-treated.The belly dancers that are a regular part of the evening here were amazing. Their dancing had some modern moves in it, and some purists might say that these tiny Asian ladies didn't quite have substantial enough bellies for it, but it was a real crowd-pleasing show. While some of the dancing was inside, in and around each table, much of it was outside the entrance, to bring in more customers. Luckily our table was aligned perfectly with the doorway so we got to see nearly the entire show.A fun night of great food and entertainment."

The most memorable part of the dinner was the belly dancer, who will perform around the restaurant and between the tables. I usually find it quite awkward to watch someone perform while I eat. The food will usually distract me from half the performance and yet you have to show some decent amount of appreciation to the performer. I felt a bit strange throughout the dance (juggling the eating and appreciative smiles and nods).

We ordered a Shisha and were then told we need to order 1 drink per person, which is fine because we knew that as this is the 4th time we've come here since getting to Singapore, but as we had just had drinks, we asked for a few minutes before we order something and they wouldn't let us sit until we ordered something. Furthermore, my wife was having a Starbucks which is not allowed on their premises, so I said it's fine, she'll finish it and they insisted she stand 2 meters away at the entrance of the restaurant and chug the Starbucks if she wants to enter.

We had heard good things about the fish and chips here so that was our main interest. I think it was a case of having too much expectation. The fish wasn't crispy nor was it well seasoned. The chips as well didn't have that nice fresh crunch. For the price, I felt that the quality and quantity should have been better. The starters were good though. As were the drinks.

The toasts were done with the right crisp and brown, and needed no more than a generous spread of their home-made butter. I could be happy with just toasts and coffee but I had to try their poached egg on crushed avocado with coriander on toast, with bacon on the side. The poached egg, with a dark yellow liquid centre oozing down when cut was just delicious. The coriander was not too strong and the touch of sprinkled salt on the plate was just right. A delightful choice if one does not want a heavy breakfast.The English House is an excellent place for a meal with friends or work meetings. Though there were quite a number of patrons for an early morning Sunday meal, it has a comfortable ambience that encourages conversations. Also, an excellent service from the staff.

Again, and very tragically, a rare offering these days. That said, sakuraya still holds the crown for nearly-alive sashimi freshness, at least among local sushi chains.

However, i'm pretty sure they just served one right off the conveyor belt anyways. The rice was tough and had dried on the sides. Gross!!!To add more, the rest of the sushi items were served with incorrect temperature (too cold) rendering nearly all of the fish tasteless. It makes me really sad when fish die and their death is wasted on sub-par meal.AND the worst part - the chawanmushi was too salty. How could they, as a japanese restaurant, mess up good ol' chawanmushi??FYI I have been here three times and the quality keeps dropping on each visit. First visit about two years ago was pleasant. Second visit, the waiter blamed me for not checking the bill before she rang up the register (Was it my job to ensure items billed are correct? How about billing the right items in the first place?). Third visit is what I described above.So based on this trend, I won't be coming back. It was not a pleasant experience for $30-40 per person price tag."

I've never paid more than $150 per head for Japanese food. I've paid more than this for non-Japanese food but I've never been to one of these super amazeballs $400 a head sushi joints like Shini by Kanesaka or Tetsuya's or what have you. It's on the to-do list, trust me. But until then, the sushi I ate at a tiny joint called Kouraku in Nakameguro/Daikanyama area, Tokyo (check it out if you're in town) is the yardstick for any and all other sushi.So Ikeikemaru was obviously no Kouraku. But it wasn't bad, I guess. I understand that they get their sushi flown in on Tuesdays and Thursdays so maybe Sunday wasn't the best day to go. Having said this, the daimyo anago was pretty great and the salmon was competent, as was the aji.What was disappointing? The chu-toro which tasted less fresh and not as well cut, and the uni which tasted like some kind of citrus fruit.Bottom line is, this is the sort of quality you would expect while paying $50 a head for sushi in Singapore.

This time, however, I got to taste more than just the sushi with their VERY generous meal provided in conjunction with the food trail.The set at Ryoshi consisted of Salad with Prawns, 5 pieces of Nigiri Sushi (Salmon, Tamago, Ika, Maguro and Ebi), Uni-topped Beancurd, Okura Ponzu, 6 pieces of Sashimi (2 X Salmon, 2 X Maguro, 1 X Akagai and 1 X Tako), Assorted Tempura (includes Ebi, Lotus Root, Nasu Eggplant, Okra and Tuna) and a simple Dessert.As always, the sushi and sashimi were fresh and good, especially the ""Big Salmon"" sushi and Maguro Sashimi which had more tender cuts than most other sushi restaurants and melted in the mouth. The Uni-topped beancurd was amazing, no doubt due to the creamy umami provided by the sea urchin gonads. What truly stood out, however, was the Assorted Tempura.The tempura batter and sauce prepared by Ryoshi Sushi is simply outstanding, converting even a friend who does not eat fried food. The sauce was so delicious I was tempted to take a spoon to it when I have regretfully finished the rest of my Tempura. Definitely a dish I would order when I next return.For many more pictures and the full review visit voraciousappetite.wordpr…"

Or do I like Itacho more?Is Ikeikemaru cheaper? No... not really. My companion and I ended paying $40 each, which is a little less than what I'd probably have paid at Itacho for a similiar amount, but not by much. There were a lot of Japanese dining there though, which probably means that compared to the Taiwan-originating Itacho, the flavours are a lot more authentic (I guess? I didn't notice that.)Personally?Good sushi (I didn't try any sashimi). The various mackerel items, the seared salmon, the vinegared fish, I enjoyed it all and often ordered second helpings of each. They're definitely very generous with the fish, and the little rice is pretty tasty. Some items lost out to their counterparts at Itacho, and some were undeniably better. This place definitely does aburi much better, and all the items get a good, solid sear. And while I enjoyed  I can't shake the feeling that Ikeikemaru is a little overrated.It's not as cheap as everyone makes it out to be (in my opinion), and while it's good, solid sushi, it's also not revolutionary. I think Ikeikemaru completely blows places like Sushi Tei and Sakae Sushi out of the water, but frankly, I don't understand how those places haven't closed down to begin with. This place is a solid, reliable option for sushi, and I'll definitely be back.But is it ""the best budget sushi place in town""? I can't really say yes."

The space where Ryoshi now stands used to change tenants a lot but I guess the business here is so good that it is going to stay for long. The Jizakama Rayu (fish seasoned in chilli oil) is as mild as it looks while the Fuwafuwa Tamago is creamy but bland.I guessed we were in better luck when we ordered the recommended items like the Nama Shirasu ($5.80). The overflowing amount of raw whitebait was a pleasant sight that no one would complain that it's too much. But the large piece of eel in Daimyo Anago($5.80) shown below failed to impress the eyes and the taste buds. It needs more sun-tanning.Notice the absence of raw fish? That is because we prefer to have it as plain sashimi but they did not have it. Nonetheless, this did not disappoint as their non-sushi items were actually tastier! Salmon salad ($8.60) is drizzled in bright and tangy dressing while the Fried Oysters ($6.80) are plump, juicy and cheap. The Pumpkin Croquette $4.80 was another of our hot favourite because it was not simply puréed pumpkin but also contain pumpkin bits.

The tuna bowl at lunch was big enough that I shouldn't have eaten as much (or any) sushi off the conveyor belt beforehand. The tuna sashimi seemed high quality and had no visible fat. The ground tuna (if that's what it was) in the middle of the tuna bowl was remarkably delicious and succulent."

Don't be fooled by the conveyor belt into thinking its some crappy sushi chain like Sakae Sushi and the like. No this is true authentic Japanese sushi, with Japanese staff and a Japanese sushi chef, the experience truly is authentic. The sushi itself is wonderful, fresh and generous cuts of fish. Pricing wise its extremely affordable when compared to restaurants like Tampopo upstairs.The best deal i would recommend is getting the Tempura Udon with a Sushi Set add-on. At around $15 ($9 udon, $6 add-on for sushi) its definitely worth it, especially since there's no service charge and GST (if I remember correctly). The tempura udon comes with 3 Ebi Tempura (a rarity since most places only give 1) with one of the best bowls if udons I've ever had. The soup borth for the udon is fragrant and delicious while the homemade udon is definitely different from your standard Udon as its thin rather than fat. The smooth texture of the udon with the tasty soup broth makes it one of the top Udon in Singapore.The $6.80 add-on for the sushi set is definitely one of the most value-for-money deals out there. At $6.80 you can get a mediocre plate of sushi at Sakar Sushi (:/) But here, you can a variety of seven sushi. Salmon, Tuna, Squid, Mackerel (or Sardine), Egg, Ebi (Prawn), Beancurd skin Sushi. The salmon and tuna sushi were the best I've eaten in a long time, the fish is very fresh, the cut of fish is thick and you can taste the natural sweetness of the fish. The rice is also moist and fluffy unlike another chain (Sushi Tei) The sushi is definitely one of the best around and definitely one of the cheapest around with its authentic taste, presentation and freshness of ingredients.I would definitely recommend this place to sushi lovers. Although its been only open for less than a month, its usually packed during dinner. Though there hasn't been queues yet, the restaurant is usually full house."

Basically there were hardly any smell detected but then I guess she must have a very sharp nose and told us not to eat the durians in the restaurant. Oh please! Why would I do that?

We came around 1pm on a sunny Sunday, as I have always wanted to try this. It got a fairly mediocre review from the Business Times, but then most Western restaurants do. Started with the jug of Heineken ($34.13) which is the usual Singaporean style of price gouging on beer. Moved on and ordered the Seafood Bucket ($28.25) which was well presented in a metal bucket and piled high with fried items. Unfortunately, most of it was chips, the fish was a relatively small piece and not a quality filet. The oysters were decent, but you could taste that they were either frozen or leftovers from Friday. There were also a mussel or two, some squid and I think a scallop. Disappointing because if you get this dish right, it is the perfect meal to share.Also ordered the bread basket ($8.24) and I am not sure how you can make bread taste so average, get some flavour! As you will see from flipping over the menu, this restaurant is owned locally. They have probably been to Freo on a recon mission and mimicked it here, the difference is that the seafood restaurants get really fresh items, and you do not need to drench them in batter to make them taste better. Lastly, your prices in the menu should reflect GST and service charge - anything less is cheating."

It usually consists of pipping hot porridge, served with a few simple home-cooked dishes. Located in middle of a row of shophouses, next UE Square, there is this restaurant who offers this traditional comfort food till late at night. The place is decorated in traditional style in a modern way. Currently the restaurant is having a supper buffet promotion till end of this month, one can eat as much as you can from the displayed dishes over the counter, as well as the braised platter. The dishes available on the counter are quite a selection, ranging from the traditional salted egg, braised preserved mustard greens (Mei Cai), to shredded potato, spinach with 3 types of eggs and crispy fried smelt fish 美人魚.Porridge 白糜 ($0.70)The teochew style porridge was a watery version with the rice grains holding their shapes. It is rice cooked in a short time with a lot of water. The porridge is served half dry like a mountain, with the other half like the sea, which is unusual.Steamed Meat Ball with Porridge Water 人乡随俗 ($5.50)It is steamed meat ball, served with the water from the porridge. The steamed meat ball is stuffed with salted preserved vegetables which gives a slightly salted taste. Unusual way of serving, but feel that the meat ball is a bit too firm, and lacking of juicy bites.Braised Delights Platter 卤味拼盘 ($16.90)Duck, Pork Belly, Large Intestines, Egg, Bean Curd, Tau PokI like the juicy braised duck which is quite juicy.Cockles (Soy Sauce) 蛤（酱油）($6.90)I seldom eat cockles these day, as I don't like having overcooked version. The raw ones served here are soaked in dark soya sauce, are juicy with bites.Big Sotong 大苏东 ($6.90)The steamed squid is served cold, with salted fermented soy bean chilli sauce. The sauce is tangy and spicy with a hint of saltiness.Cold Bean Curd with Preserved Radish 菜脯拌豆腐 ($4.80)It looks such a simple dish, with just the plain bean curd topped with chopped preserved radish and spring onions, yet it is appetising to have with just plain porridge with extra crunch from the preserved radish. Never thought of that when having porridge at home.Preserved Radish Omelette 菜脯蛋 ($2.50 S, $4.50 L)I like that the simple omelette is covered with crispy surface and crunchy inside. But it gets a bit too oily after some bites. Need more plain porridge to smoothen the taste.Fragrant Minced Meat 香豉肉碎 ($4.20 S, $8.20 L)The minced meat is cooked with bean paste sauce. Slightly salty and oily, but appetising to have with just plain porridge.Mullet 黑鱼 (Seasonal Price)The fish is steamed and served with chopped preserved mustard in it, which adds additional crunch to the meaty fish. Teochew Fried Crab Balls 潮州炸蟹枣（3粒）($9.80/ 3 pieces)It does not look like balls when served. I almost want to ask if they have sweet flour sauce to dip it with. Although it looks very crispy, inside it is juicy with meaty crab meat, and crunchy ( I suspect crunchy water chestnuts). One piece is not enough. I wish I have ordered more.Crisp-fried Taro Rolls 香芋煎卷 ($2.30/ piece)There is a minimum order of 3 pieces for this item. While light and cripsy on the outside, inside it is smooth and soft with the sweetness from the yam.Sweetened Mashed Taro with Ginkgo Nuts 白果芋泥 ($3.80)It is rich and smooth, served with coconut milk. The ginkgo nuts taste a tab bitter. I would prefer to have them soaked in syrup to remove the bitter taste.I have Barley 薏米水 ($1.80) to finsih the meal with. Light and easy down the throat.Overall the food is not bad, and there is still a lot of dishes which I have not tried. I am glad to find this place that offers comfort food in the city area."

Definitely a great alternative to other stuffy steakhouses. Sorry Morton's, I grew up eating your steak in Chicago but it's time to say goodbye. Now for the main event: we ordered the 1.1kg bone-in ribeye and it was heavenly. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the meat was the definition of what a fine steak should be. They offer a selection of steak sauces on the side but please skip them and enjoy the beef directly (btw, ever wonder why every filet mignon comes with bearnaise sauce?  Because filet has NO flavor!). Side dishes were equally brilliant - mushroom risotto, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach paired nicely with the steak. Had a blended super Tuscan which brought the whole meal up a notch. The hostess, waitstaff, and bartenders are fantastic and are clearly a cut above typical Singapore restaurant staff.  My first time dining here and it certainly will not be my last - bravo!"

This is based on *one visit*, so hopefully won't discourage others from trying it (as most others have positive reviews). Also, this may just be how it is in Singapore at this kind of restaurant!Food: The quality was top notch and prepared perfectly.Drinks: I only drink wine but found the selection to be good =)Service: They texted me to remind me of my upcoming reservation. I like this, except... The text also said the table would be turned over 2 hours after. I found this rude and made me rethink going. I am not a slow diner, but it is typically just me as I travel by myself a lot. I don't want to pay a lot to feel rushed.Service (continued): They sure didn't seem to be in ANY rush when I got there. Not only was the place not fully booked, I wound up waiting. A lot. On everything. I got my wine and then about 15min later, my first course (delicious). I was done with the first and waited for ~22min more before I finally waved someone down. They cleared my plate. I didn't keep track at this point, but my steak (main) finally showed up as I finished my glass of wine. I asked this person (because who knows where my wait staff went) for another. I don't like a steak without wine. Unfortunately, this took a very long time. Steak was cold by the time I got the second glass. Overall I was stuck there for over 2 hours when I didn't WANT to be.Ambience: It has a lot of promise, and this may be regional, but I found it filled with families with kids (a Sunday night) that were terribly behaved (a lot of shouting). There is not much the restaurant can do about this, however, so I try not to ding them for it but will warn others (or let parents know, hey, this is a good place for kids).So I wound up spending over 2 hours, over US$100, for a rather stressful, loud, drawn out meal in which I had to flag waitstaff down constantly. Thankfully the food was good! When I'm back in Singapore next, I will walk by and see how full it is. If they can happen to fit me in and its quiet, great."

There's a lot of places that offer some kind of slab of fairly young beef, not or little dry aged, and fried using methods that do not give the high heat required to get a good char on the meat whilst keeping the insides red or pink (like the Josper grill that has conquered all the London steakhouses). For example, the steak served at a famous 313 Somerset steakhouse is a travesty for the price, it's just flashed on a warmish pan, I can do that at home (and better; I'd actually leave the pan on the fire for several minutes before putting on the steak, so it's hot enough to char the meat, not end up with a greyish slab of depression).This you should bear in mind, because it explains the pricing. Yes, $188 for a 1.1kg steak is not cheap. Yes, the main pieces - Costata, Bistecca - are not dry aged, not significantly that I could taste anyway, but you do get the option of a 45-day aged Angus for $60. As for the cut it's pretty simple: ""bistecca"" is a T-bone, which is slightly less tasty and has more bone, and ""costata"" is a ribeye, which should be your default order at any steakhouse as it has the most flavour, although it is quite fatty (doubly so since this is a wagyu breed with plenty of marbling). The fat in the ribeye is where the flavour concentrates when you dry age the cut. T-bones are fillet and strip steak attached to a bone; both cuts are very soft and tender but lacking in flavour compared to the ribeye; considering the ribeye is cooked properly and therefore will also be tender, the tenderness of fillet However, the flame grilling method is sufficient to get the right char on the thick cut steak which qualifies Bistecca as a ""decent steakhouse"" in my view. It's literally a wood fire built in their kitchen, with a grill on top, and the steaks on the grill in the middle of the flame. It's a shame you have to choose between dry aged and charred crust (the Angus is 300g, too thin for a proper crust to develop) but at least both are an option. The sides are what you expect when you pay $15-25 for high end Italian in Singapore. Honestly they could serve mac and cheese from a tin and I wouldn't care, since I come here for the steak and barely touch the sides. But they are very good (I miss the lentils and sausage, if you're reading this, Bistecca chef), and could be a meal by themselves if necessary. The interior is original, thoughtful, interesting, it goes beyond the ""Nordic minimalist"" look that you get everywhere and where it's hard to draw a line between fast food joint and cool modernism. Cow hide on the floor, hilarious paintings on the walls. Service is prompt and knowledgeable, including knowing about how a thick cut steak will be rawer close to the bone and thus might need a bump up in doneness versus your usual. This gives the place a much friendlier and more fun feel than the ""big name"" steakhouses like Morton's or Cut. If you prefer the 5* hotel feel, you might not enjoy Bistecca, it's more of a quirky boutique hotel. I personally love it.What could be improved? Simple: dry-age the costata for 45 days as well (or go wild: 60 days!), and charge me extra for it (because I know how expensive storing something for months is in Singapore, especially with the humidity). I'll still buy it, because there's no alternatives except maybe a couple of items on Cut's menu. Bistecca would not, or barely, be competitive against the institutions of London or New York (like Goodman's), but it's offering enough to be THE steakhouse of reference in Singapore as far as I'm concerned. I just think it's a shame that you can source dry aged meat and you don't bother on your flagship cut. I also miss the cypresses or whatever trees were shading the front porch..."

The cut had too much fat and not as flavorful as I expected.  Desserts here are solid, and we were not disappointed by the 2 classics - tiramisu and panna cotta.  So far, I am been to Bedrock and Bistecca and while both have been good, they haven't been great.  And service at both places could be improved.

Next up, since we were sharing the steak, we needed it to be cooked in a manner that each of us can enjoy  I prefer medium rare on the rare side.   She prefers a more true medium rare.  I am quite ok with this.  I tried explaining to the server that we would like the steak cooked to a true medium rare.  He stated they prepare them more on the rare side of medium rare.  I explained once again.  He suggested they prepare the steak, bring it out and, if needed, they would cook some of it some more for her.  I attempted to explain that this would ruin her portion of the meat.  If returned to the fire after slicing, meat will almost instantly seize up and become tough.  After making no headway, I gave up.In the end, he brought a steak that, while not blue, was certainly more rare than medium rare.  Even with me focusing on the rarer portions, we had to assemble some slices for her  and return them for additional cooking. Yes, this meant her portions were significantly less tender than mine.All that being said, this was not the most significant issue with the steak.  There was an extreme oiliness to the steak.  This was true in texture and flavor.  It was very disappointing.tinyurl.com/c64228bSauces: salsa verde, garlic mayonnaise, Porchini mushroom, and red pepper / tomato compote There are four sauces served with the steak.  I am not sure why in serving a $180 steak they feel sauces will be required but they do provide them.  For the most part, we only took a mild interest in them.  After trying each, none really stood out as something either of us would like to add to a steak.tinyurl.com/c4qr2dpPuré di patate As whipped potatoes go, these were very good.  They were light and buttery.  For an à la carte  side, the portion was a little small.  Luckily, for me, my friend was more focused on the asparagus.tinyurl.com/cpc3cgtAsparagi grigliati con olio al limonThis asparagus was quite good.  The grill had imparted a nice flavor and brought out some of the natural sweetness of the asparagus.  It was also still very crisp.

Not that I don't like to share, but if I'm going to be paying $178 for it, I want to enjoy it the best I can. Its simply seasoned with salt and pepper (like how all good steaks should) and grilled over a charcoal fire that results with plenty of charring. It's served pink and juicy and in deliciously thick cuts which I find makes for fantastic chewing. If you're the type that prefers your steak well-done, I'd say give this place a miss because you'll be wasting your money.

Disclaimer, I have not had a true European Costata or Fiorentina so I had no proper comparison. However, taste and texture-wise, the meat just didn't seem to justify the outrageous cost. To note, the meat is not dry-aged, which affects the flavor. A similar quality steak could be had for much less in the US.They provided quite a selection of sauces to go along with your steak, salsa verde, porcini mushroom, mayo... but given the high quality of steak do you have to slather it with sauce? (I wouldn't)To put things in perspective, you can consider it one of the top places for steak in Singapore, but it cannot compare with steak at good places in North and South America.All in all, the final cost ended up in the 3-digit range for two people for the steak, a couple of sides and appetizers, without alcohol. It's good, but not *that* good. What's that I smell? It's not the grilled steak, it's the smoke wafting from the hole in my pocket..."

The cut had too much fat and not as flavorful as I expected.  Desserts here are solid, and we were not disappointed by the 2 classics - tiramisu and panna cotta.  So far, I am been to Bedrock and Bistecca and while both have been good, they haven't been great.  And service at both places could be improved. So while the steak was a little disappointing (and expectations were very high), the apps, pasta and dessert were all solid."

I went there for dinner with my family this past Sunday to celebrate my Dad's birthday. Dad loves steak and Cantonese food and since we children had the choice for once, we picked steak. The restaurant has some outdoor seating, tables at the front and back of the ground floor and probably some upstairs. We were seated at the back section on the first floor, surrounded by very loud diners at both tables around us. I asked that we be moved to a quieter section and the waitstaff obliged quickly and painlessly. We had a couple of steaks (filetto, Fiorentina single cut and a Shiga Wagyu), pasta, 4 sides and two starters to share among 3 men and 2 ladies. It was just the right amount of food and some of the highlights for me were the starters - a perfectly grilled polipo and giant lump of burrata with Tuscan tomatoes. The portions were as you would expect with the relatively higher rent in Singapore compared to Tuscany, but the seafood was fresh and the tomatoes as sweet as it was off the vine. I also loved the ribeye cap and meat off the rib bone, charred crisp on the outside but left medium rare on the inside. Perfecto! The roasted Kipfler potatoes were also excellent (its like a slightly bigger version of the baby potato and a nice taught skin when cooked). Finally, our waiter was kind and discreet enough in helping us serve the birthday cake and took some pictures too. Just the kind of fuss-free evening we were looking for and I happily paid for it. Will be back again when the tummy or occasion calls!"

Walking into the converted shophouse, everyone in my party was impressed with the restaurant's modern wooded interior and warm welcome which included complimentary toasted focaccia bread served with an unctuous olive oil.  To start our meal, the four of us ordered the chicken liver paté crostini & the burrata cheese with a tower of grilled eggplant & tomatoes.  The former was regrettably forgettable, and while the burrata was really creamy and a big hit with my mother, I actually prefer the burrata flown in from Italy 3 times a week at Valentino at Turf Club Road.  That one has a soft ""cheese shell"" which adds texture and resistance as you bite into it.Moving onto the mains, we took their recommendations and ordered: 1) the Wagyu beef parpardelle with mushrooms and saffron cheese(left) and 2) their signature steak(below). Sadly, I found that neither of them lived up to the real thing in Italy.  I was disappointed with the parpardelle whose saffron cheese seemed an unnecessary addition on the plate and just made it really salty.As for the steak, I preferred the medium rare, beautifully thick juicy pieces I devoured in Florence.  They was tastier, and the meat just looked more appetizing!  The one at Bistecca Tuscan were sinewy and a little too chewy from the tendons. Perhaps I am being picky, and biased towards the more 'filet mignon' texture of the meat served in Florence.... Nevertheless, no one will deny Bistecca Tuscan needs to work on their presentation!! Why drape a random spring onion over a messy pile of beef?That being said, the HUGE saving grace (and surprise!) of this lunch for me was their DELICIOUS homemade bombolini (or italian doughnuts and semolina fritters) served with a cup of cold cappuccino for dipping.  I don't usually touch the dark stuff, but even so, I couldn't stop slurping down the cool cappuccino liquid.  The doughnuts were soft and fluffy on the inside, with a crispy, sugary exterior that made ME want to melt into the dish.  I would go back again and again, JUST to have this dessert!Overall, I would say the pros: good ambiance, warm service, GREAT doughnuts... the cons: average steak, non-spectacular mains, expensive!  See my pictures at: thefearlessdiner.wordpre…"

For the mains, we shared the Fiorentina Wagyu T-Bone and the Costata Bone-In Rib Eye (along with salads and veggies). Am glad I was seated in front of the rib-eye as it was a lot tastier than the T-bone (I would even go so far as saying the T-bone was just standard).

I celebrated mine in Wooloomooloo November last year. So this time around, after scouring the net, we decided to on Bistecca - Tuscan Steakhouse.As it was a weekday, reservation was a breeze. I actually gave them a called to inform them in advance of this special is my LD's birthday. Nestled in Mohamed Sultan buzzing row of houses, finding parking can be quite troublesome. The best part, I did not notice that Bistecca provided a Valet service on Wednesday to Saturday from 6 pm onwards. So silly me, we ended up parking in UE Square, walking quite a distance from the car park to the restaurant.We were seated on the indoor front section of the restaurant, where we can see the bar and chefs at work. The restaurant has a nice classy dark oak wooden setting, with dim lighting and leather chairs. A painting of a lady with two buffalo feature prominently in the centre of the restaurant. We were quite lucky that the manager actually look after our table, so service was great throughout the evening. To kick start this special occasion, we started with our favourite drinks, Lemon Lime and Bitters.  A drink that we fell in love with when we are in Melbourne, it is difficult to find this drink in Singapore but recently it is getting more popular and we are so glad. Following the drinks, we have our starters;  Insalata di pomodori, burrata, prosciutto e rucola (Creamy burrata cheese, sweet parma ham, Momotoro tomatoes and rocket with italian dressing -$18) & Crostini fritti di fegatini alla toscana (Lightly pan-fried Tuscan country bread topped with house made chicken liver 'pate' and fresh majoram - $15).Burrata with parma ham has become our favourite entree. As long as the burrata is fresh, nothing can go wrong with this entree. All the ingredients here are fresh combined, mixed in fresh tomatoes and balsamic vinegar it is just refreshing and appetizing. The crispy crostini create a nice complement to the smooth and creamy chicken pate.For the mains, we ordered medium rare Costata (1-1.2kg bone in rib eye of Bistecca's exclusive organic grain fed Wagyu - Holstein. Marble score 6+, aged - $178). The sides accompanying the steak are Gratin di patate ai funghi porcini (Potato gratin with porcini mushrooms - $14) & Crema di spinaci (Creamed baby spinach - $15). The sauces selection are salsa verde, garlic mayonnaise, Porchini mushroom, and red pepper / tomato compote (our ketchup) + mustards. The steak has a nice balance of meat and fats are cooked to perfection. It has a nice charred on the outside that seal the juice inside the meat, and perfect medium rare on the inside. On a first bite, it is beautifully tender and slowly melts in your mouth. Any sauce you choose will go nicely with the steak, I preferred the garlic mayonnaise and salsa verde. My secret weapon to tackle this huge steak is lemon. A little bit of lemon juice will help to cut through the fats of the meat and avoid you being overwhelmed by the fattiness. The creamy spinach is not to my liking, as it is creamy, mushy and a bit bland. However my LD enjoy it, so it is fine by me. The potato gratin has a nice texture of crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice potato and porcini flavour. After all the food, we only left a little space for dessert. So we decided on Zuppa di rabarbaro e fragole con gelato allo yougurt (Rhubarb and strawberry ""soup"" with natural yogurt ice-cream - $12). The staff manage to put a candle on the ice cream and it become my wife official birthday ""cake"". Although the rhubarb and strawberry ""soup"" looks like a baby food, it tasted refreshing and wonderful. It has rhubarb sweetness, strawberry sourness and the creamy yogurt ice cream just blend in nicely together. The dessert is on the house and what a way to end a nice evening. Yummyy!!Overall, dining in Bistecca was a wonderful experience. Service was great and we won't hesitate to recommend this place for steak to our friends. Price is on the upside, however you are paying for quality. We'll be back for more in the future. Saluti e arrivederci !!

Interestingly enough, they have a minimum age for the interior area. To add to that, the minimum age is different for male versus female. *mind blown*Nice assortment of whiskey selection, but don't expect anything rare. Like all of the drinking establishments around Singapore, prices are going to be fairly steep for a stiff drink. Service is good and the staff kept the drinks flowing pretty well all night. They had a live band here playing pretty good cover of top 40s plus some classics. Pretty good vibes and there were a few ladies dancing, but most of the action seems to be next door at one of the adjacent clubs."

The second time I ever came here, i ordered a dozen kamikaze shots to share with two others.. I shot six shots one after another (because they weren't strong I downed them like juice). Six shots in 15 mins should be lethal, I felt nothing.

I stopped by on a weekend night to go drink with some Singaporean friends.The bar was pretty busy but the hostess put us on a small table outside immediately.There's some kind of promotion going on with Guinness, but it was very confusing because a Guinness girl would come up to us and only take orders for Guinness, then relay the order to the bar. Except for that we already had a waitress so those orders were ignored and we had to go through our normal waitress again. Huh? What exactly is going on here?There was a live band, which was alright. You could see them displayed on video screens outside. I heard some other band while I was going to the restroom, but they were TERRIBLE. I'm not sure whether it was the same band or the band from the neighboring bar which had a shared bathroom.I got a ginger beer cocktail which was alright.

And that isn't a bad thing! While you'll find the same Paulaner classics as Millennia Walk, they'll taste subtly different. While the Original Munich Lager, the Original Munich Dark Lager and the Weissbiers feature on both menus, there're subtle differences in flavour between the ones brewed in Singapore and the ones on offer here that are imported direct from the brewery in Germany. Little differences like the water, for example, make for a different end result.My favourite beer however, isn't even on the menu at the other Paulaner. The Weissbier Dunkel, or dark wheat beer, is excellent. The darker, maltier flavour leaves an almost chocolatey after-taste, and makes an excellent companion to the food on offer.Happy Hour runs every day, from noon to 8pm, and again from midnight to closing, and there's live music on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The food is well prepared. Not mind blowing, but they do a good job reproducing the typical German classics. Nurnberger pork sausages were a definite win, cooked till it had that brown, crisp skin, but still juicy and nowhere near dry. The Pork Chop was also delicious, and I confess, I actually gnawed on the bone to get those last few bits of meat. It was a little pink, but I like my pork that way, though I know that some people still feel uncomfortable eating pork that's anything less than well done. (Side note: you CAN eat pork medium, or still pink, as long as you're sure of the supplier or the restaurant.)Overall even those this Paulaner doesn't have the 'glitz' of the microbrewery, I do have to say that I much prefer the broader selection of beers at this outlet. Actually looking forward to going back and trying their beer cocktails as well."

I still prefer the one from Cozy Corner.Signature Dishes:Ayam Buah Keluak/Chicken Black Nut Stew - Classic Nonya spicy and tangy chicken stew with 3 buah keluaks infused with fresh root spices of lengkuas (blue ginger) and turmeric Me: Nothing great, so so, better buah keluak at FolkloreNonya Chap Chye - Classic Nonya mixed vegetables, bean curd skin and mushrooms braised in a rich prawn bisque.Me: Only beancurd skin and cabbage  - most uninteresting although the taste is not bad. Laziest version I have seen & eaten.Gingerflower & Lychee Sorvet - a Godmama exclusive by local creamery Apiary, topped with roasted peanut crumble and lime jelly.Me: Nice & refreshing but prefer it without the peanut crumble.Not a Signature Dish:Pulut Hitam Panna Cotta - silken coconut panna cotta served with pulut hitam (Black glutinous rice) and coconut shavings.Me: panacotta not bad but pulut hitam doesn't have much taste.Verdict:This is not going to be a restaurant I will patronise unless I'm nearby and have nothing else better to eat.Sigh!

For $24 a huge glass almost like a pitcher, you get an alcohol packed drink that guarantees highness. Ok that depends on how good a drinker are you. I guess it's quite worth the money. What's best to have with the mojito? Nachos. For 14 bucks, you get a huge pile of corn chips with a pile of beef or chicken con carne, salsa and cheese. It's awesome! Ok maybe it's the alcohol talking at the point but it is indeed better than brewerkz.So if you want an afternoon drink or to chill out after work, this is quite a good place to go."

It took about 20 minutes to get to the front and order our food, but they do have a good system in place to keep the line under control. We chose the soy sauce chicken rice and roasted pork rice plates.  You can add extra sauce or spicy chili on the side once you get your meal. The portion is pretty generous considering we only paid a whomping $6.10 SGD!! The chicken was so tender, and the roasted pork had a perfectly crunchy outer skin and tender inner meat."

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?I'm told the lines at Hawker Chan can easily exceed an hour, so I'll consider myself lucky that on a Saturday at lunch I only waited forty minutes. Once you're front and center, the woman working the counter is especially sweet, and you'll have you dishes in only a few minutes. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Unable to decide between the flagship Soy Chicken Rice and the Char Siew Noodle, I opted for both, which combined were only about 6 SGD. That's insanely cheap, and some of the best value you'l find anywhere in the world. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Honestly both these dishes were just okay, and I was surprised to find that I like the Char Siew much better than I did the Chicken Rice. Even if you don't get a full or have chicken the chicken rice is more or less bone in, which necessitates quite a bit of work while eating. From there, the white rice was just okay. The char siew was much better, but even those noodles fell a bit short. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?There are simply too many amazing food stalls for me to recommend the wait for Hawker Chan. No Star."

We got to the Chinatown complex around 9:30am but the stall didn't open until 10:30am. Then I found out that they opened an actual storefront across the street. While yelp lists that that one opens at 10am, it actually also opens at 10:30. Wanting to eat at the OG location, we went back into the Chinatown complex and waited on the line for the stall to open. We were about #5 on the line and we showed up about 45 min before opening. By the time she opened the shop, there were about 15 people waiting on the line. Once opened, the line moved fairly quickly and surprisingly orderly. They menu was pretty limited. You could order soy sauce chicken (their speciality and claim to their Michelin Star), roasted pork and bbq pork. There may have been other items but i only saw those three on this day. You can get them by themselves or with rice or egg noodles. A plate of chicken or pork over rice or noodles is $2.50 (singaporean dollar). Dirt cheap! Half a soy sauce chicken is $7 and whole is $14!! We ordered half a chicken and char siew pork over rice. The chicken was really really good. The seasoning was delicious. Not too salty or too sweet. Just the right amount of spices. It was also super tender. Next we tried the char siew pork. We thought the pork looked burnt but wanted to try it anyway. And oh my god are we glad that we did. The char siew pork was THE BEST char siew pork either one of us have ever eaten! The outer crust had a slightly charred caramelized layer that is crunchy when you bite down. The middle consists of a perfect balance of lean to fats to add tenderness and flavor. We were blown away by how good it was. I think the real star is the char siew pork and if I had to choose one, I would pick the char siew pork over the soy sauce chicken. The following day, we went back to try the store front location. The storefront prices are double what the hawker stall prices are. One plate of chicken/pork with rice or noodles is about $5. Still a huge bargain for a Michelin starred restaurant but the prices are different and I thought I should mention it. I presume the higher prices go toward the higher cost of rent for this larger location and also AC and more staff. I ordered the char siew pork over noodles this time and skipped the chicken. The portions appear slightly larger than the one we received from the hawker stall but still not a huge portion. The char siew was also not as good as the one we had across the street the day before. It wasn't as charred or caramelized. It was good but not mind blowing. If you have a chance to visit here, I'd highly recommend eating at their original hawker stall over the newer restaurant."

The lines for this place can be massive, and we had to wait about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning. The chicken here comes with a delicious savory sauce (kind of like sa cha), and you can add on a chili dipping sauce for a bit of spice. We also tried the char siu, or Chinese barbecue pork, which was lean, sweet, and savory. The bed of white rice made for a perfect medium to soak up the sauce, and the beans on the side added some nice texture.Was it worth the price? Definitely!

I like the fact that they call customers up one by one so that you don't feel rushed or jostled while you are ordering. We got our food by 10:55 or so, so not a bad wait at all. We ordered half a chicken and one order of soy sauce chicken over rice along with a side of veggies for good measure. The chicken - even the white meat - is velvety tender and juicy which is challenging to find. The ""soy sauce"" sauce is the right balance of sweet and salty.

The chicken itself was cooked really well, and I thought it was roasted quite nicely. Unfortunately that's where the benefits end. The seasoning was quite mediocre, it tasted a little bland in some place. The rice was terrible and low quality tasting. The sauces and accompaniments taste like the typical items you can get from any other average hawker stand.The good part though, is that the price was super low. At around $2 a plate, it was a steal.

Yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses. The food stall is located on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex, which is across the street from the air conditioned sit-down restaurant. The reason I chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is ""supposedly"" better. Also, if I'm going to come all the way here - it's better to eat at the original right? (Especially since Hawker Chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world). The soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a Michelin Star. At the stall it is S$2.50 (super cheap for a Michelin Star meal!) I also ordered a char siew rice which was also $2.50. There are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice, roasted pork rice, and the chicken hor fun. Most dishes are S$3 and under. Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well. I love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate. Was it amazing? I'm not sure. There are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious. I'm not sure what makes the chicken stand out. The char siew, however, was really good - I liked it more than the chicken.Overall, I think my expectations were too high because of this place's popularity and its star. The only reason we came here was to try the ""cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world"". I'm not sure if I would come here again and wait in the really long line. Comparing this place to other one Michelin Star restaurants I would give it a four star (good food at a very cheap price). Comparing this place to other Hawker stalls I would give it a five star."

The chicken is glazed in some sort of sauce that pretty much seeped through the soft chicken skin. Every bite, mixed with the rice is just heaven. To top it off, the pork dish is delightful too.

And I felt like it wasn't worth the wait and for one of the precious few meals of Singapore. It is nice that it only costs about 2 dollar each plate... but for us we were looking for something more tasty I guess? So if you're expecting a real decent and quality good taste, this is not the place. The chicken rice wasn't bad at all, but was it worth waiting so long and worth eating at a food court in china town where it was so crowded and hot? I'm not sure.... I mean... if it was exceptionally good, which I kind of hoped it to be, I would totally and happily eat at even worse environment but it just wasn't ""that"" good.

We ordered 2 dishes: the awarded Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken, the Pork Char Siu/Siew. HK Soya Sauce Chicken:  Very, Very good.  The meat was mostly tender and the sauce was a right combo of savory and sweet.  A few pieces were a touch dry, but all in all, for SGD 5.50, it's worth going to for this alone and waiting. There might be better, there might be worse, but at least I have a good base to compare other versions of this dish.  My one regret is not ordering the half chicken, but perhaps on another visitPork Char Siew: HOLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY HELLLLLLLL. Yo this was bomb.com/gov/edu.  The char siew was tender with the great ratio of meat, fat and caramelization of the outside.  If the one at the OG stall is even better, I don't know if I can handle it.  Noodles: My goodness. So good.  Some of the better noodles I had. They  enhanced the proteins we ordered;  good by itself, good in the sauce it was in, good with any combo of items I put in there.   In short, this entire bill was less than $8-9 USD for an experience that I hope to repeat in the future.  A Michelin star increases the focus on this restaurant, and I get the immediate sense that the expectations on this place are heightened.  It's cheap, it's very tasty, and if there are better versions of these items at another place or just better at this location, I hope to try it sometime soon."

This is not the original location, but one of the other brick & mortar locations.I had so many similar dishes at home - and I thought to myself, ""what could possibly be so different?"" The answer is a lot of things. First off is the pricing. You can get an entire meal for less than 5 USD which is a steal!!The signature dish is the Soya chicken. The chicken was extremely flavorful and the sauce is subtle. The chicken falls right off the bone and that's when you know you got some high quality meat.Next up is the triple pork platter which was basically chinese bbq pork cooked in three different ways. Honestly I like this better than the Soya chicken. It's hard to explain and put into words, but trust me it's a beautiful explosion in your mouth."

At Kotoshi Ryori, my husband and I enjoyed a great omakase dinner, where every course was prepared with careful detail and tasted delicious. As a fringe benefit, because we went in at 6pm, we had the restaurant to ourselves. Sure, the location isn't great being in an industrial park, on the bright side it is extremely accessible being right next to the expressway. Also, the restaurant isn't as small and cosy as I would wish (next time we might go perch up at the bar counter). But the food was amazing. Sashimi with delectable cuts of fish and a seared prawn that could rival a small crayfish. Pan-fried foie gras! Wagyu beef! If you are looking for an omakase dinner that won't break the bank and don't want to learn the strange ways of booking six months in advance like for some other place, this is the place to visit. Great for a slow thoughtful dinner (e.g. ""what is this delicacy I am chewing on? Delicious!) maybe bring a date, or frankly, just anyone who really likes Japanese food. Service was friendly and prompt and the chef came to chat with us, so really, all you can ask of a good omakase experience. The restaurant also does budget lunches and an a-la-carte buffet lunch and dinner.Tip: if you want Alaskan King Crab to feature in your dinner, give Master Chef Albert a call 3 days ahead."

Their roasted pork is made with a unique marinate, roasted over a charcoal to produce a  golden brown skin, which is crispy and produces a nice crunch when you bite into it.Their roast duck is roasted to perfection with  glistering maroon skin.

The part we like about ordering standard items is simply because of the ""Wok Hei"" flavours.Xing Zhou Bee Hoon - $4.50Simply loves the home style ""Cai Po"" (Preserved Vegetables) Egg! It was fluffy and tasty. Best is that I can actually eat them alone without being worried that the ""Cai Po"" will be salty. This is something that I usually crave for as our household stove usually could not achieve such standard as we do not have strong flames in the kitchen.Cai Po Egg - $5Tasty and light on the appetite with ingredients like slice fishes, carrots, lettuce, sweet corns, tomatoes in it.

It's always hustling and bustling by 7pm, so I've learnt to come much later on, where you can sit down for a nice, chilled out meal, eating beneath Parisian lamps and enjoying the cool draft that always seems to accompany this area. I have no doubt that their chef is more than capable of making every dish on the menu here taste delicious, but there are a few that I always cannot resist ordering. The sweet and sour pork is a must-have, so well-endowed in batter that each piece is so crispy; though this means that there is less meat in each piece, you hardly miss it at all. The fried butter squid has a very nice crisp batter as well, different from the crunchy kind that is used in their pork - this one is more light, perfect for seafood. I'd also get their hotplate tofu, which is as good as it gets, really. I would also ask for their recommendation of vegetables for the freshest ones, and they stir-fry it up with lots of garlic so it tastes very full-bodied.If you're craving for cze char around Bukit Timah, this is most definitely the place to be."

The former is a braised tofu dish with cuttlefish, scallops and prawns. The tofu is so soft and addictive that my friend who avoids soy-based food couldn't resist it after one bite. The seafood treasures are also fresh and combine well. I have to eat butter squid at every visit as it is irresistible. Fresh pieces of squid coated in a thin batter and fried crisp with curry leaves and chili padi, in butter. That last bit with butter makes the dish quite unhealthy but so, so tasty. I'm also a fan of the mee goreng here although it's not as popular as the headline dishes. It's fried with lots of egg, ""wet"" style with just enough spice. Another veg dish I like to order is the broccoli with a heavy dose of garlic. Pai kuat wong (pork ribs) is also a winner at this joint.

Not quite. Tucked away in a little corner of Sunset Way lies Buttercake n cream, a little bistro hidden away from the business of Singapore. It is a beautiful little bistro. Cozy al fresco dining area with an even smaller, cozy indoor area. We chanced upon this restaurant while looking for something new to try around my place and with a hundred and fifty 5* ratings on their face book page (yes... 150), we thought we'd give it a go! 150 reviews can't be wrong right? Right? Wrong. Firstly, in terms of variety, Buttercake n Cream has a lot to offer. From sandwiches, to pastas, to steaks, it had a little something for everyone! Not knowing what to eat, we decided to go the ""safe"" root and went with pasta. While I went with the recommended Seafood Aglio Olio, the gf decided on an even safer choice..... The carbonara. Anyone who knows me knows that I love my pastas. Not only do I eat a lot of pasta but I make the very often too. Seafood Aglio Olio First impressions? It smelled fantastic. The pungent-ness of the garlic was coming through with than hint of lemon (yes, the key to a good Aglio is that little dash of lemon juice that helps elevate the garlic, gives it a good punch and adds acidity to help cut the oiliness). However, the pasta was slightly overcooked and the overall dish was pretty salty (again, this might be a preference). However, they managed to get the garlic to acidity right, which was nice. Carbonara The first warning signs to me were there. Luxuriously creamy & homemade cream sauce. Cream sauce.... 2 words that should never be used in a carbonara, essentially because a traditional carbonara has... You guessed it, no cream. I make a lot of carbonara because it's one of the few pastas that the gf really likes, so I've painstakingly experimented a lot on not only making my carbonaras as tasty as possible, but I try to make it a traditional as possible. First impression? Not very good. The dish came looking a lot more like noodles in cream soup than it did a carbonara. It was swimming in sauce. Pasta was also overcooked and it didn't help with that much sauce as it only made the Spaghetti turn even soggier. While the taste was decent, it was way too heavy thanks to all the cream and there wasn't a trace of egg flavour in it, which was disappointing. Unfortunately, we were a bit full from the mains and didn't get the chance to order their desserts or cakes. Who knows? It may be much better but we do find ourselves needing some convincing before decided to head back for cakes again one day. Overall. Average food, nice ambience but a little on the pricey side considering their location. It's a nice place to meet up with friends... if you're not overly picky about the food."

There was a plethora of cakes on display at the counter and when we were there the place is rather empty. We sat outside al fresco and was amused at looking at a rat/mouse walk around the empty chairs. The desserts were pretty good. The apple crumble and chocolate lava cake are above average quality, and the vanilla ice cream had vanilla bean bits in it which means it is not just a scoop of Walls' ice cream.They also serve food, though I doubt I will purposely travel to eat there unless I am in the area."

As seats were few, the food took a long time to be served and customers lingered after dinner, it seemed like many walk-in customers walked away, intimidated by the small crowd. Dining inside allowed us to enjoy our meal in the classy interior of the shop, although dining outside seemed rather pleasant as well, with dimly lighted lights creating a cozy, relaxed atmosphere. Food took a long time to be served, as did the drinks. As we had to repeatedly request for water, check for our drinks, mains and even desserts, and were left constantly wondering if they were too understaffed. However, when the food arrived, our previous grievances were easily forgotten in the visual treats set before us. The 3 Course Set Dinner for Two @ $49.90+ included an appetizer, a main course, one dessert (for two to share), and a drink. The Appetizers: Chef's Wild Mushroom Soup or Supreme Mexican NachosChef's Wild Mushroom Soup was creamy, contained quite a few bits of mushrooms and generally was delightful. Supreme Mexican Nachos was on the whole a rather dry appetizer to commence a meal with, and not exactly to my personal liking. The Mains: Choice of Pork Knuckle for two or 2 choice of any of the following-Char Grilled Beef Tenderloin, Dijon Norwegian Salmon, Grilled Pork Collar, Roasted BBQ Chicken LegChar Grilled Beef Tenderloin: 2 of my friends had this-one ordered a medium and the other opted for a medium-well. Medium was more tasty than the medium-well, which seemed to have been a bit too well done, robbing the meat of its sweetness and ""juice"". Medium was not too ""bloody"", easy to chew on, and definitely more savory than medium well. Grilled Pork Collar: Tasty combination of meat (and fats). The soft meat stops short of being able to simply melt in one's mouth.Dijon Norwegian Salmon: The huge serving of salmon was simply overwhelming, and if not for the fact that several chunks of it were delivered to my friends' plates, it would be quite difficult to stomach, especially with the dessert coming after the mains. Salmon was really fresh, the meat sweat. Set atop a green spinach crepe stuffed full of the greens, alternating between a mouthful of meat and a mouthful of vegetables helped eased the big piece of salmon down. For the vegetable lover, the health nut who do not want to ingest too much healthy fats (from the salmon) or the calorie conscious, starting with the delicious green spinach crepe hidden below the salmon might be a good idea.A Sweet Affair/Desserts: Baked Crumble Apple Pie or Chocolate Fondue Pot, or top up $3 for signature Warm Chocolate Pudding or Apple Rhubarb CrumbleTOP UP! to get the signature Warm Chocolate Pudding! Chocolate lovers would fall head over heals in love with the warm, molten chocolate served with vanilla ice-cream and vanilla cream on the side. Wonderful way to trigger the release of endorphin, and filling us all with the much needed euphoria ere the day/much treasured weekend ended. Baked Crumble Apple Pie was sweet, with a vanilla ice-cream atop of it. The vanilla ice-cream here is delicious, and most of us could not help commenting on how good it tasted. In short, the inconvenient trip down to Buttercake is worth it, if you have the time to spare-to find a comfortable place away from the thronging weekend crowds in more accessible places, to find parking, to wait for the drinks, mains and then desserts-and if you care much more for the company of friends  than whether the service is fantastic or not."

However, after the last visit and reading up a bit about the cuisine, I am feeling more at ease when dining at these places. Founded in 1965 in India, Raj landed on the Singapore island in 1988, serving Indian vegetarian food from ....North, South East West of India??? (the website says so)Before you start navigating through the menu, it is good to have some Papadam (5 at $1.80) to silence the growling stomachs. After all, everyone may also need some time to decipher the long list of food, especially when the menu at Raj is more extensive than Ananda Bhavan. So, the million-dollar question is : What to order? Well, the simplest step is to pick any items from the Dosai list. For instance, this Butter Marsala Dosai ($4.70) is a good set that will fill up any average adult. Its a typical triangular crepe filled with potatoes chunks, tomatoes cooked down to a mash. They come with the three chutneys-mint, tomato and coconut. Alternatively, go for theplain-flavoured ones like Sada Dosai ($2.90), Paper Thosai ($3.80-pic above), Garlic naan ($3.20-pic below) and choose from the array of vegetarian curry pots for dipping. The paper thosai is suitable for those who like it crisp but it is also more greasy to the touch. Ours came as shiny as a bald man's head that reflected the dining lights very well.Our first dip was Palak paneer ($10), a familiar North Indian dish that consists cubes of home-made cottage cheese immerged in rich spinach puree. It had the smoothest texture out of the 3 and received the most number of thumbs-up at the table. But it should be consumed in moderation as it was extremely savory. Alternatively, there is the Dhal Butter Fry ($7.50) which had a slightly tangy flavor imparted by the spices in the pool of simmered lentil gravy.The chef's specialty--Soya Keemar Mattar ($10), was a delectable pool of minced tofu and green peas (mattar) in an aromatic semi-solid gravy. It had a thicker consistency than the dhal butter but was less salty. The dhals were all tasty, but we underestimated the sizes of the dhals curry and still ended up with at least half a pot.In order not to contribute to the amount of food Singaporeans are wasting each year, we ordered more sada dosai and also the above Sadam Uthappam ($3.30), a thicker version of dosai. Imagine tu-tu kueh minus the filling. One experiences a sharper tang even though both Uthappam and Dosai are made from fermented batter of rice and lentils.And I am proud to say that all the food were 100% polished off at this farewell class dinner=D The slight hiccups in the service did not deter the mood as everyone chatted merrily into the night. While Indian vegetarian cuisine may not be the cup of tea for everyone, I believe it was a good cultural experience. Should you be interested to try out, Raj is a good and affordable place to begin with!"

Suffice to say that I was not disappointed at all: at $3 per bowl, I was treated to a relatively big bowl of rich soup that had me slurping to the last drop. Coming from a fish lover, I had no problems with the strong fishy taste of the fish meat; in fact I loved it! Each slice of fish had thoroughly absorbed the rich taste from the soup, and they had a meaty bite to them. I write about this because I've eaten substandard fish slices too many times; the fish just disintegrates and I hate that. Overall, eating this on a cold rainy day is a real treat! And on a warm day, it's just as refreshing an experience; I was always tempted to drink up every single drop of the soup."

Tucked away at the end of the row of shops including Haato and E-Sarn at Ridgewood Close Condominium, I would not have known about it myself if a friend hadn't brought me there. Valle is a nondescript neighbourhood bar, but don't let appearances fool you. The bar is stocked with a smorgasboard of beers, ciders and ales from all over the world. I was shocked and delighted to find Paulaner Munich on tap for $12 a pint. In fact, all the drinks are priced super reasonably. You can get Rekordlig for $12 compared to the $15 you usually see it sold for at the bars in town. You can refer to this page valle.com.sg/fullmenu.ht… for the incredibly comprehensive menu. The prices listed are delivery prices (yes, they offer delivery) but I believe the prices at the bar are $1 or $2 more. Needless to say, if you're an avid beer drinker, you will really like Valle. I also like the low key and casual vibe of the place. It really is your friendly neighbourhood bar where you can hang out and with your friends while enjoying a really good beer. Sadly, I've heard that the condo management has been forcing Valle's owner to revise the closing time earlier and earlier. While they used to close at midnight, they now have to close at 10pm, I'm guessing because of residents' complaints. This is probably why Valle's happy hour ends at 6 as the owner wants to encourage people to visit in the day. I do think Valle would be a really nice spot for a quiet afternoon drink as well."

Sotong was translucent, quite different from the ones we had. Fried Hokkien Noodle tasted light and did not have over powering use of prawn stock. I enjoyed the loaded amount of wetness from the dish as well as the generous use of eggs increasing a pleasant taste in it.Fried Hokkien Noodle - $3 / 4 / 5Though cooking style may not be similar to the mainstream plates of Fried Hokkien Noodle we had, ingredients used were relatively the same with beansprouts, prawns etc.Overall, it was a comforty and contented meal to someone who have been missing the dish after shifting out from clementi for a period of time."

Food wise, menu is a mix of Asian flavours and an array of dim sum. My friend and I ordered the starter from the blackboard which was a wonderful chargrilled octopus using charsiew sauce. The numbing pork ribs was a main we shared. It had a generous helping of fried garlic but was a tad dry."

So after a long workday, I sometimes find myself craving a takeout and I often end up ordering from Chopsuey Cafe. So this review is for the delivery service, not the actual restaurant - obviously the food comes from the actual restaurant but I can't comment on service or atmosphere.I am addicted to the mudcrab fried rice, I simply love it, to me it tastes exactly like how fried rice should taste like in my book. And it's wild rice, so I can pretend it's semi-healthy! The sweet and sour pork is also pretty tasty and so are most other mains I have tried. The only dish I found a tad disappointing is the prawn toasts, which is unfortunately one of my staples for a Chinese takeout.The fact that it comes in ""authentic"" Chinese takeout containers* is a huge plus for me. Not only are they giving me that familiar feel, I also find it is easier to eat out of when sitting in your sofa haha.I have ordered many times from them and the quality of the food is consistent. Add in the fact that they typically throw in chocolate chip cookies as a freebie and it's easy to understand why they are one of my favorite takeout places even in times when there is a wide variety of options for food delivery.*for those who have no clue what I am talking about, these containers are apparently called Oyster Pail. Google and you'll see what I mean."

There are a lot of good restaurants in Dempsey, but this one is definitely top dog.They serve up delicious ""Asian Fusion"" (Westernized Chinese) food here and absolutely phenomenal drinks. All the dishes were packed full of flavor and the best part was that they all had unique, distinct tastes. Fortunately I came here with a party of 7 and had the opportunity to try several different dishes; I can say with certainty that I enjoyed every single one. In my opinion the only negative is that this spot is quite upscale, so I would definitely only come her every now and then for special occasions, rather than dine here regularly.Favorite dishes:- Szechuan pepper chilli chicken: I expected this dish to be super spicy, but instead was quite surprised to find out it was more of a sweet 'n' spicy and tangy flavor. The chicken was nicely cooked and the sauce was just perfect. Really enjoyed this one. We also order the Tofu version of this dish for the vegetarian at the table and it was just as delicious. - Wok breath rice noodles with snapper: The noodles picked up this amazing smoky flavor from the Wok and the oyster broth was rich and delicious. The snapper was flaky and soaked in all the flavors from the broth. - Five spice lamb ribs: WOW! I have never eaten ribs that were so tender and perfectly cooked. They tasked smoky, sweet and spicy and were fall off the bone good. They do have a slightly numbing feeling though, so if you're not a fan of that sensation then stay away from this one. - Crispy duck steamed buns, White skin siew mai, Scallop crab & scallion dumplings: All three were excellent. Perfectly cooked and full of great flavor. Each were severed with a unique sauce which paired perfectly together. The drinks were also extremely good. I tried the Imperial Caipirinha, the traditional Brazilian drink. But this one had an Asian twist and was served with muddled lychee. The Old Fashioned was excellent, just the right amount of sugar and smokiness from the bourbon. The perfect drinks and flavorful dishes led to an amazing dining experience."

I'd say it's a little pricey for Chinese food that you can otherwise get elsewhere for half the price. However, I think it's more the concept you're paying for and sometimes, that's okay. Perfect place to go to with a bunch of girlfriends - think, Tai Tai lunch - (as opposed to having to go to a fancy white-tablecloth-tea-pouring Chinese restaurant) this place has the right amount of trendiness to it, with the same good Chinese food. Now, not quite the place to take your grandma nor the right place if you're a tourist looking for real authentic Chinese food. Like I said, everything here is family style. So it would probably be wise to go with a few people you're comfortable sharing food with. While we were here, we got the Deep Fried Whole Red Emperor Fish, Steamed Paper ShaoShing Chicken, 2 Veggie dishes and the Chili Chocolate Cake. Everything was really good. The Red Emperor Fish was filleted and deep fried to perfection (I normally don't like deep fried fish because of how dry it can get but this was not at all). The Paper ShaoShing Chicken was good too, healthy, if that's what you're into. The veggies weren't too salty or oily. And the Chili Chocolate Cake was heavenly, rich and oh-so-chocolatey. A nice addition to Dempsey Hill!"

And knowledgeable about the menu enough to make excellent recommendations.We had:1) Crispy Duck Pow Pockets ($17): pillowy-soft steamed white buns jammed with sliced duck confit, pulled roasted duck, julienned vegetables, and drizzled with a tangy-sweet bean sauce: a must-try.2) Szechuan Pepper Chilli Tofu ($18): a vegetarian variant of kungpow chicken, comprised beancurd squares wok-fried with blackened dried chillis, garlic flower, pickled radish & ginger, mushrooms, long beans, and cashews in a peppery szechuan sauce. Skip this, it was middling and forgettable.3) Crispy Crackly Organic Egg with King Prawns ($18): a fuyong omelette of sorts, was laced with holy basil and chilli for a subtle heat, and drizzled with honeyed soy for extra oomph. Lovely, albeit a little oily.4) Honey Ginger Chicken ($24): ginger-marinated chicken wok-crisped and then tossed with honey, ginger root, sesame seeds, and curry leaves; reminiscent of sweet & sour pork. I can see why a Caucasian palate would like this.5) Chopsuey Chopsuey ($16): a medley of seasonal organic baby vegetables sauteed with holy basil. The smoky char was evident, as was the delectable crunch.6) Wok Breath Rice Noodles with Snapper ($26): fish hor fan dotted with silver sprouts and spinach, and drenched in a rich oyster sauce gravy. It's not the memorable hor fan I've ever had, but I liked the smoky char coming through every bite, and appreciated that the sprouts were relieved of their heads and tails properly.7) Vodka Cheng Tng Cocktail ($19): didn't like it. The sticky sweetness of the cheng tng only exacerbated the bitter edge of the vodka, instead of balancing it."

I had a good experience previously. The establishment i tried this time was at Dempsey. The location is very quaint. Very nice actually. The food is fusion chinese. And that's what makes it interesting. The flavors and textures are Chinese but not exactly. The chef mixed herbs and spices to make it different from traditional Chinese fare. Flavors are strong. Nothing subtle about it. The strong flavors and sauces require you to accompany the dishes with rice. The food was good and fresh, however prices was a little on the high side. Service too was good and attentive. Overall I would recommend paying a visit particularly if you what a change of typical Chinese food."

It used to be my motivation to come for my ballet class held at a centre just at the recreation centre as well - nostalgic memories were created here! While Jack's Place does have many other branches spread out all over Singapore, my favourite has always been and always will be this particular branch. The staff there have mostly been working for more than 10 years too - from the waiters to the cashiers to the managers, they pretty much watched my sister and I grow up. We just recently dropped by to celebrate my last birthday, and it was a great feeling to see the familiar faced auntie bring out my birthday cake - just like she did 7 years ago. Staff here provide excellent and heart-warming service, and they really do mean to strike up a conversation when asking if you are enjoying your meal, not just as part of the protocol service standards like some other restaurants. Food wise, be sure to try their T-Bone Steak at least once, medium well is usually perfectly done, with a slightly pink centre and juicy meats with a crispy surface. Their portions have been consistent over the many years, unlike some others that seem to be continuously shrinking! Another old favourite would be the chocolate cake, with thick layers of comforting chiffon and smooth creams, and a generous sprinkling of shaved chocolate over the top. Of course that was my birthday cake!"

Say ""yes"" to the fresh veggies and what you'll end up facing is an aromatic bowl of fresh ingredients and delicious beef bits steeping in a hearty brown broth of bones and aromatics that has been developing more and more depth in that roiling cauldron.​Thaksin is another excellent reason to visit Clementi Central and one more stop in the food crawl through this food enclave in Singapore's heartland.  This same coffeeshop also houses Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee, Brother's Rojak, and Tan's Tutu Kueh.  Great bang for foodie buck!"

Quite a quirky name for a food stall and probably works well for marketing purposes, the stall also dishes out a number of Thai food which I should look to try someday. In a bowl of beef noodles, you get kway teow, generous pieces of beef with tendon, beef slices parsley all within a rich broth. You can get it in 4 sizes: ""Standard"" ($3.50), ""Value"" ($4), ""Supreme"" ($5) and ""Super"" ($6). The broth is really herbal and deep that can only come with boiling their soup for ages. The winner for this dish is having a bite of the soft rice noodles with tender beef slices and fragrant parsley. Very comforting dish you'll want to have on a rainy day."

Taste:The duck meat is tender and flavorful. I don't know how else to describe. Felt like I could never have enough. They typically give the breast meat, unless you request for other parts. The yam rice is also well cooked and fragrant. And their thick dark sauce ensures that the rice isn't too dry nor is the sauce too wet. The yam taste isn't too overwhelming, but nevertheless is enough for you to enjoy it (and not think it's just white rice that's black/brown in color) Soup provided isn't bland and the herbal taste is quite significant. And the cucumber provided is crunchy and fresh. (I'm that nitpicky)Oh, and did I mention about their chilli? Make sure you get their ""mix"", not just the belachan or just the chilli sauce... You've got to mix them! Quantity:The basic set meal cost $3, but I'm only satisfied with $4 - I eat relatively more. That being said, my colleagues are typically OK with the $3 meal.  Note that from $3 to $5 only the quantity of duck meat changes, but that shouldn't stop you from splurging on more duck meat. Overall:The only real price to pay for this meal is your time. Be ready to wait about 20 mins just to get your duck fix, but it's worth it!"

It has a yam-like flavour to it and is done just slightly moist so it pairs nicely with the tender pieces of duck and braised sauce. The duck meat here takes on the form similar to chicken rice as it is leaner and slightly smashed. The soup is another highlight to the dish - deep, herbal and flavourful. It goes so nicely with the rice and I always try to ask for seconds for the soup. This is great duck rice that beats roasted duck or chicken rice anytime."

(I was made to ponder, ""Didn't one ""long"" of lormaigai use to have three bundles rather than just two? Didn't most of these dimsum items use to be in the $3.xx range rather than in the $4.50-$5.50 range?"" I felt a bit like the animals in Animal Farm, being told that life in Singapore is constantly getting better and cheaper, rather than more crowded and more expensive.)On our last visit (June 12th 2013) the Yangchow fried rice was a bit salty, so we let the waitress know. Hopefully it will be corrected on our next visit."

Conveniently located near Holland Village MRT, just a short few minutes walk. Minimal lines, fast service, and wallet-friendly price points. Got a half chicken ($11.90) and Chicken Taça (bowl in Portuguese) ($9.90).Grilled chicken was delicious with their ""legendary chilli sauce"", tender and tasty, the chicken breast didn't taste bone dry. As the other review pointed out, chilli sauce was similar to the Hainanese chicken rice chilli, slightly sour and garlicky. Chicken Taça came with spiced rice, salad vege on the side, topped with chargrilled chicken tenders and sauce over it. Rice was underwhelming in its flavour profile, and Garlic sauce we chose for the Chicken Taça was disappointing, tasted more like creamy mayo with just a hint of garlic. Would skip the sides and go for the grilled chicken. They're having some promotions now, including BOGO on their Chicken Rappa. Also, they're on Burpple Beyond -- you can get 1 for 1 off Main Dishes!

Eighteenchefs has a positive social media presence due to their social enterprise business model. I really like their story and hope they do well, but I can't say anything good about their food. We ordered the heart attack fried rice with egg, the salted egg snack platter, and teriyaki chicken. The snack platter was a bunch of cheap deep fried foods, and not very much of it. I like deep fried food, but this was just cheap frozen stuff they threw together. The salted egg sauce did taste a little of salted egg, but it wasn't outstanding. The heart attack fried rice had a strong garlic flavor and it was fine, but isn't what I would call outstanding. I would go next door to botejyu for their garlic fried rice. The teriyaki chicken was missing teriyaki flavor, although I did taste the char of the grill. The potato and apple salad side was tasty, but it wasn't the point of the dish.I'm wondering whether the create your own dish fares better, but I don't feel particularly compelled to try this chain again. The lack of care in some of their dishes makes me think it doesn't really care beyond giving their food a nice and catchy name with a positive branding."

Located at the far end of a stretch of shophouses near West Coast Road, the exterior of this cool little bistro reminded me of a summertime beach house. The decor theme is a mix of lemon yellow stripes against fresh whites and blues, full-pane glass doors and lots of windows - such a happy, inviting place, tucked just steps away from a quiet private residential neighbourhood.Indulge yourself with the shelves of magazines, little trinkets and nostalgic old-time snacks (think rabbit brand candy, and sour lemon!) as you wait for your food to be served. We were tempted by the seemingly popular Mee Siam, but somehow all ended up ordering the Hearty Breakfast or classic Eggs Ben (all great choices). The Hearty Breakfast was yummy and very well made, eggs were perfectly fried - runny on the sunny side, slightly charred on the other... the sausage and toasts were tasty, and served with arugula salad on the side. Happy patrons we were.I really love this place - service was warm, friendly and prompt. Food was good and not grossly overpriced, and it wasn't too packed for a Saturday either.

Now, I've have rated W39 3 stars. I enjoyed the mee siam although it was atypical (much too rich and creamy, though the poached egg was a fascinating take), and while it might not become my go-to place when I have a mee siam craving, I definitely wouldn't mind ordering it again. The Eggs Benedict was well put together, my only complaint is that it was TINY. I could have had three of 'em. The Honey Lemon was way way too sweet, but once the ice started melting, it wasn't so bad.BUT. For everyone else at the table, I could tell that W39 felt a lot more 2-starry than 3. (And if you'll refer to Jerilyn's review, you'll get further evidence why.)The Nasi Lemak that one of the other Yelpers ordered was... very underwhelming and the small size of the Hearty Breakfast, well okay it wasn't small, just not HEARTY (full caps intended). The rice for the nasi lemak was under seasoned and the paninis were awfully small. Small niggling issues here and there that really undercut the place standing out amongst the increasing number of brunchy cafes popping up in Singapore.My conclusion after our visit? An Eggs Benedict and Mee Siam are just enough to feed one, and if that's all you order, you'll have a pretty good meal.If you stray off that path that I have painstakingly cleared for you though, don't blame me when you find yourself in a minefield of mediocrity."

Was quite crowded on a rainy Sunday evening where most people were there for dinner; isn't it a testament to how good a place is if it is filled on a raining Sunday evening? The interior was filled to the brim and so was the exterior.We weren't there for dinner but vowed to try their mains the next time around as it looked so good from what we saw at our neighboring diners' tables. Ordered a chocolate cake (forgotten the exact name but have a look at my picture) and the texture was gooey, melty and is a chocolate maven's piece of heaven - a must try. The coffee wasn't the best but was passable.Loved the atmosphere! Wished I knew of this place while I was at NUS as it would definitely be on my hang-out list!"

The place wasn't too hard to find from the nearby bus stop (you might have parking problems if you're driving though!) and the ambience was decent. There are lots of nostalgic stuff laid all over the place which makes the overall ambience quite cosy - albeit a little forced, as another Yelper mentioned in his review. Having gone down mainly for dessert. A friend and I ordered a flat white, the crunchie hazelnut and a tiramisu to share among us. I take pride in my coffee and I can honestly say the flat white was nothing special - a little too flat (pun unintended) actually. The crunchie hazelnut and the tiramisu looked great and I thought it would at least make up for the disappointing coffee. I was wrong. The crunchie hazelnut had an overwhelming taste of fresh cream that made it far too sweet for both our tastes. The tiramisu came with a serving of espresso - which was something I had never seen before, and for good reason. Without the espresso, the tiramisu tasted entirely of marscapone. Even with the espresso poured in, it still felt pretty... off. I couldnt taste any kahlua liqour in the tiramisu with or without the espresso, which to me, sealed the deal as one of the poorest tiramisus I've had. If you want a good tiramisu, try out Kith Cafe at Park Mall - it's far better. The place was also quite noisy, so if you're looking for a quiet place to hang out with friends or loved ones, take note. I didnt try any of the food items, but the lamb ribs and wagyu burgers other people were eating looked quite appetitizing.  But then again, so were the desserts we ordered.Not coming back to this place again. At least the service here was something worth mentioning."

I also tried bites of the Mee Siam and the Ham & Cheese Panini. The Ham & Cheese Panini definitely tasted kind of like something I could've done myself, however, the Mee Siam was probably the best thing there in my opinion. It was hearty, with a nice sweet flavor to it. I enjoyed that the most. We also got the Honey Lemon Ice Tea which tasted like someone spilled half the jar of honey into. Did they?! Ambience: Like I said, great concept, horrible execution. They try to be ""cute"" with the cute nautical theme and selling old candies we grew up with but it just seems kind of copied. The seating inside is limited and pretty cramped and the service was alright. All in all, we left happy to have met everyone but not so happy with the food. Not horrible but really nothing special."

Sorry westies, you're not gonna be seeing more food posts from the western part of Singers.My Mocha tasted more like regular latte. Where is ze chocolate??! Meh-ish latte at best. Very diluted. Thankfully I've lowered my expectation so I wasn't overly disappointed. Don't go expecting anything artisan.Hearty Breakfast ($13.50) is a greedy and lazy girl's best option. Well, first and foremost, it has everything. It's quite hard to screw up an American breakfast since everything is kinda outsourced. The scrambled eggs were a little overdone for my liking. The best part was the toast (i think it's brioche) with its airy texture. Salted butter would be welcomed anytime. I originally opted for a Brie Parma Ham Panini (or was it a Croque Madame) but i was tempted by the Braised Pork Cheeks Gruyere Panini (S$13) that the neighboring table ordered. The mouthwatering scent was too good that i had to change my order immediately! Boy was I glad i did!The panini was stellar with the slightly crusty shell and dense and moist center. Pork cheeks were tender and flavorful and the sandwich had a perfect meat-gravy-bread ratio. The taste of the meat was rather strong but i'm a carnivore so i don't care. Besides, it was balanced by the savory gravy and the light sweetness of the bread.If you're looking for something lighter, the assortment of cakes, breads and pastries should not disappoint (i base that on my review of their breads)."

As fellow reviewer Mark D. said, it's quite pristine! The store is a well lit, organized meat heaven. When you walk in, you are greeted with a ton of beef, chicken, and pork to choose from- steaks, sausages, burger patties, you name it. I also like how the employees who work the counters are always attentive and willing to help. I've bought their Australian steaks twice and enjoyed them both times. Outside of the meat, the rest of the store caters to Western tastes. They have a small section for veggies/herbs, a decent selection of cheese, along with bottled beers and other condiments. The bistro is outside, so al fresco dining is your only option. My husband and I ordered their burger with gruyere and caramelized onions. To be honest, we thought it was just okay. We actually think Go-Go Bambini (also in Dempsey) has the better burger. If you feel you've eaten some ""misteaks"" in Singapore, then stop by here; you won't be disappointed! :)"

We sat down for a bite before starting our shopping. We didn't come soon enough to get the chicken meal. Pretty darn Paleo, minus the fries which could be easily substituted. Instead, we opted for the short rib and my oh my, was it delicious. I'd still go for the chicken next time we're there (if they have it), but if you're down for a more indulgent meal, I'd say give it a shot. We had two ciders to go with our meal. I ordered a pear cider and hubby got the lime cider. There was beverage envy, but I was pretty stingy and didn't share too much because it was so good. We'll be back. This place's meats make me seem like an amazing cook. Bacon wrapped dates with a roasted, seasoned chicken and a side of roasted cauliflower?

Nothing special.The butchery is a very pretentious fancy place for people who are okay with buying ungodly expensive meat. Yeah, yeah, the butcher can cut it any way you like but for that price he really should sing and dance for you as well. The quality of meat is not better than if you just go to a regular wet market (well, hello, it's Singapore, the quality is superb anywhere) but the variety is better.

Fresh, great cuts of meat with all sorts of herbs, potatoes, tomatoes, onions to cook them with, this place is like a candy store to steaklovers - wait - like a butchery to a steaklover. Okay analogy lost, but you get my point. Feast your eyes, or have a US ribeye to devour at the al fresco bistro. Be warned though that the grill masters are rather inconsistent, sometimes a medium steak turns out exactly pink in the middle like it should be, sometimes it's brown and well done in some parts, and medium only in 20% of it. No one experience has been the same for me, but it's good enough for $28-ish, it scratches the itch without breaking the bank.They serve their steak the way purists like them, no sauce, some salt and with good shoestring fries and some greens. I've never paid much attention to anything else on the menu. I do fancy the french onion soup now and then, but it doesn't quite compare to the thick intense concoction (blanketed by gruyere cheese) that I've had in better French restaurants. Still, a bistro's a bistro, adjust expectations and you'll be a happy diner here.Note that bistro hours differ from the butchery's. Bistro's operating hours as follows:Monday: Closed Tuesday to Friday: 11.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m.  Saturday, Sunday & public holiday: 9.30 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. Both butchery and bistro are closed on Christmas Day, New Year's Day and Lunar New Year."

Besides, customers can enjoy TV while eating. The kopitiam has a giant LCD TV that delivers digital DVB-T free-to-air programmes to customers, so the picture quality is very high, even for standard definition channels. More importantly, I did not expect the taste of the food here to be great, as it was my first time here a few days ago. This place specializes in local zi char and I like its sambal stingray and sambal kangkong. The sambal stingray is well-cooked. Sambal sauce is spread out evenly onto the giant piece of stingray, and it is great pleasure to chew its gristles after eating its flesh. The sambal kangkong, a famous dish in Singapore and perhaps Malaysia as well, is also well-cooked here. Unlike many places in Singapore where the flavour isn't very ""original"", the intensity of spiciness here is just right. Apparantly the restaurant isn't ""stingy"" with ingredients. The medium fried beef hor fun here has a few giant pieces of beef served together with hor fun, and they taste good. Food is rather affordable here. A plate of stingray, a plate of medium fried beef hor fun and a plate of small sambal kangkong cost S$24.00 altogether."

Not much rice though - they don't give a full bowl.I definitely want to come back and try the other dishes given the relatively inexpensive prices and large portions and authentic taste. The kimchi was excellent even though I'm not a kimchi person, and I liked the seaweed side dish."

Situated in Bukit Timah Plaza, the restaurant itself is nothing fancy, with just the bare minimum furnishings and paper signs as their menus.The food on the other hand, is truly an authentic korean fare. One of my favourite dishes is the beef bulgogi rice set. Unlike usual korean food stores that serve this on a hot plate, Ming Jia offers it as a stew in a bowl that is usually used to serve kimchi stew. The pieces of beef are left simmering in the stew, adding flavour to the thick broth. The beef is tender and a tad salty, but this is cancelled out once you eat it with the rice. Another dish is the kimchi pancake. Packed full of vegetables and chilli, the pancake is crisp on the outer ends and soft and chewy towards to centre. A special soy sauce is served together. The unique taste, somewhat like a cross between miso and soy sauce, brings out the kimchi flavour in the pancake. Don't underestimate the portion size because it is extremely filling. The good thing is you can request for a take-away box if you can't finish the dish."

We joined our Korean friends who swear by this place as being their go-to place for homestyle comfort food. They tell me 3 Meals A Day is a Korean reality comedy cooking show but don't think it has anything to do with it. The food here is no joke.We arrived right when they pulled up their window blinds and flipped the OPEN sign. We did have a reservation for a Saturday but by the time 6:15 rolled around, every seat was already taken. Really enjoyed the kimchi as part of the banchan set. No harsh fermented taste like how kimchi can taste at other places. I think this is the first time I only went one round on the banchans because there was simply too much food.The Nakji Bokkem (stir-fried spicy octopus) came out shortly after ordering. Nakji Bokkeum is one of my favorite dish in Korean cuisine. It creates a perfect harmony out of the two things I love most - seafood and spiciness. After taking the obligatory Yelp pics from every angle, we dug in and absolutely enjoyed this spicy dish. I don't know what it is about Korean chili sauce that makes the food taste so good. It's the kind of fiery spice with a hint of sweetness. Vegetables were not overcooked and held their crispness and the octopus was nice and tender. It wasn't until we dug in deeper that we realize there was mound of noodles underneath. Yum!The Jap Chae (Korean glass noodles) was very nice. The foundation of the dish - soy sauce, garlic, and sesame oil - came through nicely. I hate dry Jap Chae because the noodles continue to absorb moisture even after cooking, but the Jap Chae here was warm and moist, and went well with the other dishes we ordered.Finally, the large order of Bossam (boiled pork) arrived and that's when I got really excited. I realized boiled pork doesn't sound very appetizing but I've been told that although it sounds like a simple dish to make, it requires some skill to make right. The dish here was flavorful and tender. One can tell that they took their time in brining the pork and removing any bad smell/taste that can accompany bossam made in a rush. The thinly sliced pork was served with both raw and parboiled veggie leaves for wrapping along with the sides of ssamjang, sliced green chilies, raw garlic and kimchi. You won't find anything to barbecue here so your clothes will be safe and sound. The service was good but could use a little more proactive attention. Will have to come back to try their fried chicken, jjigaes, and Korean sashimi. Jal meogeosseumnida!"

Well, I was right. The meat is too fatty.Spicy seafood and mushroom noodle soup ($13++) - 1.5 starsThis was sort of like a Korean ban mian. The soup tasted great but after a while the noodles absorbed the soup and the starch from the noodles made the soup unpleasantly thick. Not many ingredients. I'd much rather get the sundubu the next time.Service - 5 starsThey took the initiative to move us from the bar to a table once a table opened up and were generous with the banchan refills!$33 for the two dishes.Update 9 April 2017Fishcake soup ($8) - 3 starsThe soup was alright. The fishcake inside is like the one in the banchan though with 2 additional varieties. Sort of like a Korean yong tau foo/ngoh hiang-type fishcake. We ordered this and the bulgogi since we weren't that hungry. These two dishes and the banchan were enough for us.Original reviewBanchan - 2 starsVariety is decent but each dish isn't spectacular.Beef stew - 2.5 starsToo sweet!Beef bulgogi ($13) - 3 starsFlavor was okay. We shared between the 3 of us and the size was about right, though. Stir it quickly so the bottom doesn't burn.Seafood pancake ($16) - 2.75 starsKind of thick and bland without the sauce.Fishcake soup/stew ($28) - 3 starsThe fishcake was strung on the skewers. Tasted like Japanese fishcake (oden) or the fishcake you get as banchan.Persimmon punch - 0 starsThe cinnamon was way too strong even after diluting it with water! I couldn't take more than a sip.On the plus side overall it seems like they use less MSG than Kim's and Togi but more than Woorinara (I still downed a lot of water during dinner). But the dishes just weren't impressive to me. My friends love this place and much prefer it to Kim's and Woorinara.

The restaurant was rather crowded on a weekend evening, which raised my expectations somewhat. The banchan (side dishes) were pretty good and I appreciated the variety. I ordered the dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice in a stone pot), fried chicken (with spicy sauce) and haemul pajeon (seafood pancake). Although rather tasty, I felt the stone pot wasn't heated thoroughly. The rice touching the bowl wasn't crisp at all. I was also left looking around for the raw egg...The fried chicken was much better, crisp batter and tender on the inside, coated with a rather spicy sauce. The seafood pancake was run of the mill, but there was nothing much else to complain about.The usual Korean fare is served here, and I feel it borders on the 3.5 star mark, but with the wallet friendly prices I think I might round it up to a 4.

We went in with high expectations as several pictures/reviews looked good. We ordered 4 dishes - Japchae, Bulgogi, Kimchijeon, and a cabbage and beef shank stew.Japchae - I really like Japchae and have a low bar for it but the balance was totally off on this one. It was too sweet and WET (a la fried hokkien prawn noodles). Insufficient umami and balance (no pepper taste at all), and no meat in it either.Bulgogi - This was pretty bad as well. It came out with an unappetizing grey color and my first thoughts were ""no sesame seeds and scallions?"". I've never eaten bulgogi without sesame seeds which made me doubt the quality/authenticity of this place. It tasted as bad as it looked. The marinade was watered down and very simple, and frankly I have made better at home. Completely missed the intense sweet/salty flavor characteristic of this dish. The beef cut was super lean and tough as well and made for a terrible dish. Kimchijeon - This was passable though not great in any sense. The pajeon mix was too sticky and felt slightly undercooked. The dip was also wrong, tasted like ponzu when it should be predominantly salty and spicy. Also no green onions or sesame seeds in it again? What's with the skimping on basics?Cabbage and beef shank soup - Never had this before. Soup flavor was not bad but there was almost no meat in it, by that I mean If you pieced all the meat in the bowl together you would get about 2 fifty cent coins worth of volume. I'm ok if you don't put meat in your jjigaes but if you are going to advertise a soup with ""beef shank"" in the name you had better put a fair amount in. For $20 I would never order this again.Banchan - We had 6 banchan, a macaroni salad, egg omelette (somewhat like tamagoyaki), beansprouts, baby anchovies, fish cake and kimchi. None of them were really anything to shout about. In particular, Korean fishcake already has a heavy flour component compared to the local stuff, but this one tasked like 90% flour and felt like we were eating mock meat. Urgh.All in all, the food was not good for the price and I probably wouldn't come back. The fact that this place gets 4 stars on Yelp is testament to the sorry state of Korean food in Singapore."

The menu is extensive, they have a lot of dishes to choose and diners like us are just simply spoilt of choices.With the naturally sweet Thai Mango, this drink is a perfect cooler to beat the heat on the hot day. Love its taste, sweet and yummy with no additional coloring added.Mango Ice Blended - $5.50Starting with Appetizers, we had the usual Mango Salad. It gave us a riots of texture together with the sour and hot burning sensation from the chilli. Not to mentioned that it is fragrant with chopped peanuts as well as dried shrimps.Mango Salad - $7Boat Noodle is also one of my preferred dishes from Thai Cuisine, however not many places served them. We had the beef version and noodle was fragrant, topped with beansprouts, pork lard, spring onions for garnishing. The soup in the bowl tasted as good as one I had in Thailand. We ordered the small portion to have a try and it was satisfying.Boat Noodle Beef (Small) - $3.90Pineapple fried rice was fragrant topped with floss and fried with prawns, assorted vegetables and cashew nuts. The dish was appetizing and addictive. I would consider this as one of the better Thai Pineapple Fried Rice I had here locally.Pineapple Fried Rice (Prawns) - $9.50The grilled pork with their house sauce was not too bad.

The menu and order sheet were also outdated - both said the Black Truffle Mac and Cheese came with 2 sides, but the server said they didn't and both were outdated. This all confused us and made it hard to place our order. However once we had gotten this out of the way the experience here was quite positive.The Black Truffle Mac and Cheese was creamy, mushroomy and cheesy. It also had a generous portion of tasty bacon and more truffle than I'd expected. Note that this wasn't the usual cloying and one-dimensional truffle oil but the more subtle touch of shaved truffle.The Journey to the (Y)east ribs had a nice salty-sweet flavour with an umami kick. Marmite, Guinness and molasses are a good combination indeed. The meat fell off the bone and I was almost unable to transfer the ribs to another plate since they were in danger of falling off. We had the biscuit and salad with it. The biscuit was a little buttery, but Texas chicken has a better butter flavour. It was crispy and had a nice rich crumb though. The salad had slices from a very big tomato in it but it was otherwise normal.The buffalo wings were not buffalo wings. This is not an uncommon occurence in Singapore so I can't say I was too disappointed, but still it would be nice to have some menu fidelity. These wings were sweet and had a light spicy and sour edge to them. They could've been crispier too. They were served with dipping sauce which tasted slightly more like real thing but really was just a thicker version of Singapore style chili sauce. So yes you can imagine how far away from buffalo wings these were if Singapore style chili sauce was more like buffalo wing sauce than whatever these were tossed with.The Cubano sandwich tasted okay, though the bread was a bit stale and there wasn't enough pulled pork inside. The fries were crispy fluffy and the coleslaw fresh and creamy (also it was slightly sweet and served garnished with raisins - which not everyone likes)."

The food has potential but could use an upgrade on seasoning, plating and 'wow' factor. The decor is ok but not exciting and the TV distracts way too much because it's inescapable. The air con was frankly hurricane-like. And while they tried to lower it, it figuratively froze our dishes, not to mention the kids. The food was cold before it was halfway complete.

Soft, fluffy, well-buttered buns, juicy minced beef with their self-concocted sauce that packs a punch. Quality is always consistent and ensures 101% satisfaction in every bite.Prices are super reasonable even though the burgers are comparable to (or even better than) proper restaurants! $6 for a single cheeseburger, $8 for a double. All burgers come with fresh fries on the side. Don't be surprised if you need to wait, there's usually a queue even before they open at 11AM. Each burger is freshly made to order, which may take awhile, but it's worth it. They take pride in assembling each burger to look as perfect as this emoji: .

The bun felt like it was breaking apart with every bite.  A piece of lettuce on the bottom bun will keep the juices from seeping into the bun.  The fries were pretty good but I think holding the salt and letting customers salt it to their preference would be better.In short it was a good try but can be made much better.

They don't have roasted chicken which I usually prefer but it's not a big deal since the steamed chicken is quite tender and the rice has the right texture and amount of flavor. Pretty value for money in general.

I took a second bite, and it was as bad so I stopped eating it. Luckily, we happened to also get a plate of Char Kwey Teow from another stand that was the absolute best dish I've ever had!"

Nestled in the heartlands, this stall serves up one of the better satays around.The star of the show is no doubt the pork satay: it has a perfect combination of a smoky flavor and tender meat with tons of fat. You'll no doubt pile on the calories while eating this, but trust me, it's worth it. Of course, good satay must be coupled with good ""satay sauce"", and the peanut curry dip here is really addictive. Be sure to order more of the rice in order to enjoy every single drop of the sauce!The quality is however not that consistent; you might get more than a few sticks of burnt satays from time to time, but feel free to bring it for an exchange; they're friendly enough to do it for you."

It was only when I was about 17 did I realize my classmates from Hougang would travel down to Clementi Food Centre just to have this specific stall of satay. Each stick is peng kang-ed on the spot which means you get fresh meat that's piping hot from the charcoal grill. I love nothing more than the smell of a good old charcoal bbq, and one of the biggest indicators of this stall aside from the queue is the burning charcoal smell emitting from the stall. I love the pork meat the most, since each tiny piece of meat is skewered alternately with a piece of pork lard that's soft and melts in your mouth - amazing stuff! They even sell uncooked sticks of satay, which I discovered after making enquiries about catering for a birthday party. So you can basically buy raw sticks of satay and bbq them on your own at a chalet, super genius!"

I literally just finished eating and decided to give my review on this immediately - I got here about 1:15pm on a Friday afternoon and joined the queue. Took me about 10mins to receive my order? They're pretty fast as they take your order whilst you're still in the queue. I ordered the jumbo portion since I don't live anywhere near both their outlets and felt I probably wouldn't come here often anyways. Now on to the food!The portion of $6 (jumbo) is pretty huge, even for a big guy like me. Don't really need to order this size unless you're like super starving as it seems pretty generous. All you need to do is help yourself to the chilli as they serve the bowl to you. As Thai wanton mee goes, the choices of chilli are the chilli flakes or the green chillies like your usual local wanton mee. Choose either or both. The bowl of noodles comes with a small bowl of wanton soup, again the usual standard. Here's the part about the noodles.It is QQ as everyone says, quite generous with the ingredients which includes fried dumplings, charsiew and pork lard. All quite generous. The noodles I felt was a little dry and slightly clumped together. I had to pour some soup into the mix to loosen up the noodles slightly. Taste wise, I felt if they had removed the name ""soi19"", I wouldn't have know its Thai in any way. The Charsiew was pretty average and so were the wantons. They also add Chinese sausage slices inside. Pretty interesting. They aren't BAD by any means, just that I guess it was probably very overhyped. Do bear in mind that my only reference from Thai wanton mee is the one at Alibabar at katong called Baan by Rochor Thai. THAT wanton mee in particular tasted ""Thai"" to me. This one was just a VERY handsome portion of noodles with quite a variety of ingredients unlike the usual. 3.5 Stars"

The rice was a bit soft for my taste, too salty, and with not enough coconut (but you can really smell the pandan as a result). The ikan billis was not sickening for a change. The chicken wing is a chicken wing, I mean there's not many ways to improve on a chicken wing, it's a decent wing as far as wings go. No peanuts. The sauce was the best item, sweet and with incredible scent. I could not indulge fully in the sauce due to avoiding spicy foods at the moment, which may be why I was less than enthusiastic about the whole thing, which I did not consider to be worth 39 minutes of queue (prices have bumped up too, $3.90 for the chicken set). I prefer the nasi lemaks I've had around Joo Chiat. My wife, who ate most of her sauce, thought it WAS worth it, so I'll average our ratings and give it 4*. Personally, I'll try ""No. 1"" next time, its queue is considerably shorter and you get peanuts with your nasi lemak."

I have watched many videos including YouTube food blogger, Mark Weins, in my preparation for my trip to Singapore and for this dish. Be warned of the immediate long lines as this is by far the busiest stand in the hawker center. I remember waiting for a half-hour and seeing my friends enjoy their dishes from the other vendors. The wait is long, but luckily, you will be able to relate and potentially make some friends while waiting. Once you reach the register, you will have the option to order one of seven dishes depending on how much variety / portion / adventure you prefer. It begins with the simple ""Flash Meal"" of rice, eggs, cucumbers, and anchovies to the right spectrum of the ""Royal Rumble"" which has all of that + the side dishes and is about 3x the size. I wanted to get the full experience and understand exactly what makes this place unique, different, and regularly visited by the president of Brunei (one of the famous regular customers) of this establishment. Hence, I ordered the ""Royal Rumble."" - Royal Rumble (+5/5) - This dish was incredible. I had to spend about 5 minutes in the beginning to analyze and take the pictures that it deserved. The Nasi Lamak is packed with coconut steamed rice, anchovies, fried egg, chicken, pandan wrapped leaf thingy, and flaming hot chili paste. It is a one, two, punch. - One of the greatest dishes I've had and a beautiful representation of Singapore and its neighboring cuisines.

All the media coverage creates unrealistic expectations in diners who flock here only to be disappointed when angels don't appear and next week's 4D numbers fail to materialize in the basmati.  Don't expect too much, come with an open mind and set your senses free to explore and you will come away satisfied, if not pleasant surprised.It really is just honest to goodness solid quotidian fare.  Look beyond the bull-@$!# that's been piled on these guys by the media and see it for the single specialty master hawker stall that it is and you'll see what all the fuss is about.  It's just a local stall that serves good honest nasi lemak.  No gimmicks.  No fancy service.  Just think of all the superlatives that pepper reviews of the latest French restaurant, Italian joint or Spanish tapas place; why don't those same superlatives apply here?  Based on flavor alone, I see no reasonable explanation why not...unless it's the bull-@#$% these places are throwing in your eyes.Get real, get local, hug your local hawker today and tell him or her you love her.  Creepy?

Okay, maybe not quite. There are two famous nasi lemak stalls in Adam Road Food Centre, side by side. One of them is the first shop of the food centre, this one is the second. Ironically, I find that the better one is in second place. Fair enough as well, as Selera Rasa seems to be open longer hours than the other one does. Most of the time when you're there you ought to be prepared to queue up for a good twenty minutes, because many people come in line not just to order one plate, or two boxes, but a party-load of it. That just shows how good it is. The rice is always at such a good texture, though I find that its taste can be quite a hit and miss sometimes, and lacks that bit of coconut flavour to it. But Selera Rasa more than makes up for whatever's lacking with such good sambal chilli, so the rice becomes a little matter.The gold is in the chicken. The colour is so wonderfully golden, you only have to look at it to tell that it will be such a crispy treat. Inside the chicken is still so juicy and so tender, though a little oily, and it makes you wish you had more than one on your plate - which is why I always ask for two. The ikan bilis is very well fried, and as a personal bonus, don't come automatically with the nuts, as they usually tend to do, thus saving me all that time and effort in removing it.Word on the street is that the nasi lemak from this stall is one of President Tony Tan's favourite food...so 'nuff said I hope!"

I can honestly say that this is to me one of the better, if not, the best, steak dish I had at this price point ($22++). The beef was tasty and perfectly cooked. I was also pleasantly surprised by the fries, they were thick cut and nicely spiced.We also had the parmesan waffle and bacon ice cream waffle to finish the meal and again, this was one of the better desserts I had in a while. It is not sweet at all, just a slight hint of sweetness but not overly savory either, just a good balance I guess. I am guessing this is not one to pick if you have a real sweet tooth though!I was tempted to give Otto's 5 stars as I find the food worth it, however there is two things which make me hesitate:* The service was at times reasonable but also at times your typical Singaporean service (i.e. bad): rude welcoming, the paid bottle of water was warm and the ice provided was only sufficient to cool one glass of water, no cutlery for desserts,....* This is a relatively new opening in Holland V and I want to see if they keep up the food standard.So, I am definitely going back (since it is close to where I live), if they manage to maintain the food standard and up their service, I will consider upgrading it to 5 stars, however, if the food quality goes south a downgrade is also in the books.

We were a large group and ordered several different dishes - probably at least a dozen, and without fail, they each were tasty, and eagerly scarfed down. The ambience is nice - they had a live band singing the standard American songbook (50s/60s/70s/80s pop, rock, etc., including modern day pop).The only thing that might be disappointing is if you're a beer/microbrewery connoisseur, particularly if you've been to a place in the US like Portland, OR. Nothing about this place said ""microbrewery"" other than the name and a decent beer menu itself. I guess it's just that when I think of a microbrewery, I tend to think of places that have all the machinery you tend to see at every other notable microbrewery.

I had heard good things and am always excited to try a microbrewery. It was 1 for 1 on all beers, and I started with the Weisen. I am usually a big fan of Weiss beers, but this one not so much. Not sure exactly how to describe it, but it simply seemed overdone and very tart. I was happy to move on to a lager from there, but things were about to go downhill. Mid conversation, I felt something hit my back. Upon further inspection, it was bird poop...not cool, particularly for an INDOOR restaurant. Sure enough, there were birds perched in the rafters above. Thankfully I wasn't eating, but I could never return to this place for a meal without the thought that bird poop might come raining down on my meal. If you are curious, the lager wasn't great either (and I would hardly classify it as a lager--it was cloudy and almost like a wheat beer). The service was nothing special, and even a bit awkward/unhelpful at times as they had no idea what was in the mixed drinks on the menu. They tried to bring our bill before we cashed in our free beer. We then had to request the bill twice after our second round. In a highly competitive Dempsey Hill, you can do much, much better."

Amidst the posh dining enclave that is Dempsey hill, Tawandang sticks out like a sore thumb. Its ambiance is remarkable casual and it has a live show of some sorts. The show is an ensemble of acts from karaoke to musical (an abstract from Snow White and the seven dwarfs) to beer drinking competitions??? The host of the live show tries to engage the audience as much as possible. At times, even cajoling the waiters on stage to participate in a song & dance on stage. Strange. But entertaining nonetheless. I can't help but think that this incoherent string of performances (at times tacky & impromptu but always hospitable)... sorta mirrors restaurant/bar entertainment culture of Thailand. You sorta feel that your waiters are not just your servers. They try their best to keep you entertained throughout your dining experience even if that means they have to put together an amateurish string of performance. You can't help but feel welcomed.  At the surrounding tables, I notice clusters of friends (of all age groups) clapping, singing and cheering along with the performances. It's definitely was an entertaining night filled with authentic thai food and an ambiance to match. However, I might caution against bringing a first date here. The music is definitely too noisy for any meaningful conversations to take place (unless you opt for outdoor seating). The food 1. Cripsy prawn crackers - Great! How can one go wrong with prawn crackers???2. Pineapple fried rice - Ok. 3. Pad thai - Good. 4. Grilled squid - Ok. Not much flavor though. Could use a more intense marination? 5. Prawn spring rolls - Good. It came served with a piece of strawberry pierced though the top via a cocktail-pirate-like-sword. Strange. 6. Thai fish cake - Pass. Not impressed. 7. Fried pork knuckles - Great! Even though I do not typically like this dish. The porky smell was musk well. My only complain was that it took way too long to come (it was served almost at the end of the meal which meant that we were already 80% stuffed and had less space for this yummy dish. Everything else came very fast though, despite the crowd.) 8 . The fried seabass! It's so good :) - My favorite dish. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. How did they do it??? Magic. The sweet thai chili sauce was a perfect compliment to this wonderful dish. I would come back just for this. Like the pork knuckles, my only complain was that it took way too long to come. 9. Red ruby with coconut dessert - $10 - BAD. It was crazy sweet!!! sweeter than a Starbucks carmel frapp! That's how tooth-rotting it was. The coconut milk wasn't freshly made too. It tasted they used a can version. But the red rubies were ok and they threw in a few other toppings too (to be able to charge $10 for it). I found some jackfruit slices in it. However, the ridiculous level of sugar in this dessert rendered everything else inedible. The service - Remarkable fast for most dishes except #7 & #8 (which were the best). I guess mum was right when she said good things come to those who wait?"

She could be a manager or maybe the owner herself. But this made me NOT want to come back. Food was good, but wow.

And what better place to enjoy such exquisite delight other than Jumbo Seafood. Ask any Singaporean and one would tell you Jumbo Seafood is synonymous with chili crabs. It isn't just the Singapore chili crabs, when it comes to seafood in any southeast Asian countries, ""from tank to table"" is the only acceptable way. Never frozen nor even ""freshly caught"" they were swimming in the tank before it's served to patrons. One could instantly taste texture difference between live seafood vs. frozen products and all is sold be weight.

The food options were very great as it had lots of seafood to choose. We chose the feature dish of jumbo chili crab. We ordered two type of buns: fried and steamed to dip into the chili crab sauce. We also ordered the scallops, it was great! The service was wonderful as it provided with all the tools to avoid the mess that it requires to eat crabs. The tools were: plastic cover for your belongings, plastic bag for your phone, cover for your clothes, and many more. We also ordered fried shrimps,veggies, meegoreng, and many more.

The food simply tasted better than any other place and the service is far superior; you get your food quick and the service was very friendly. It is tough picking between the two flavors, but for me the chilli crab slightly edges out the black pepper crab. Fortunately I've had enough people in my party to try both. The chilli crab has a nice balance of sweet and spicy flavor. It comes in a rich, delicious eggy broth and is best enjoyed with steamed or fried buns. The pepper crab is packed with black pepper flavor and has a slight kick. Also if you don't want to get too messy they will crack your crab for you!Besides the crab, the surprise dish during this meal was the cereal prawn. It's a perfectly cooked prawn coated a thick cereal batter. The crispiness of the batter and the small chunks of green chilli give this dish a delightful sweet, spicy and crunchy flavor. Along with the great food and service, there is also outdoor seating which is nice when the weather is cool. If you have to choose one place to get some delicious crab, this is definitely the one you want to pick."

The crab quality was also lacking.  The texture of the crab, in some parts of the crab was off.  I had hoped that the sauce (even though it wasn't the greatest) would permeate the meat inside the crab, but I found the crab to be very unaffected by the sauce smothered on the outside.  WAY too much sauce in that dish for me!The service was pretty bad.  Nobody checking in on us, except for the very end when the meal was over.Kudos to the restaurant though for giving me the option to pay some of the bill with U.S. dollars.  I accidentally left my wallet in the hotel but luckily I had some cash in my pocket but still left me short in Singaporean dollars.  They agreed to let me pay the rest in U.S. currency.  If they refused, I would've had to take a taxi back to the hotel to fetch the $.  Very thankful that they did that for me.As for the crab part of the experience, it definitely fell short for me.  Crab House in San Francisco on Pier 39 is the winner for me.  That is the standard for whole crab.  I guess I'm spoiled."

And what better place to enjoy such exquisite delight other than Jumbo Seafood. Ask any Singaporean and one would tell you Jumbo Seafood is synonymous with chili crabs. It isn't just the Singapore chili crabs, when it comes to seafood in any southeast Asian countries, ""from tank to table"" is the only acceptable way. Never frozen nor even ""freshly caught"" they were swimming in the tank before it's served to patrons. One could instantly taste texture difference between live seafood vs. frozen products and all is sold be weight. On another interesting note, it is customary that restaurants server the best dish for last.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Personally, I hate sitting outdoors because the mosquitos start feeding on me! Nothing is worst than going for dinner and leaving with lots of mosquito bites.TIP: if you mosquitos love you, and you have to sit outside, wear long pants. And spray insect repellent if needed. This is not 100% fool proof, but it will help a little, thus enabling you to enjoy your meal more.Everyone loves eating chili crab here. I personally enjoy eating black pepper crab here. It is quite spicy! Be prepared to get your hands all dirty- but that is part of the experience! Don't worry, there are finger bowls as well as bathrooms for you to wash your hands.The food here is excellent.

The food simply tasted better than any other place and the service is far superior; you get your food quick and the service was very friendly. It is tough picking between the two flavors, but for me the chilli crab slightly edges out the black pepper crab. Fortunately I've had enough people in my party to try both. The chilli crab has a nice balance of sweet and spicy flavor. It comes in a rich, delicious eggy broth and is best enjoyed with steamed or fried buns. The pepper crab is packed with black pepper flavor and has a slight kick. Also if you don't want to get too messy they will crack your crab for you!Besides the crab, the surprise dish during this meal was the cereal prawn. It's a perfectly cooked prawn coated a thick cereal batter. The crispiness of the batter and the small chunks of green chilli give this dish a delightful sweet, spicy and crunchy flavor. Along with the great food and service, there is also outdoor seating which is nice when the weather is cool. If you have to choose one place to get some delicious crab, this is definitely the one you want to pick."

The crab quality was also lacking.  The texture of the crab, in some parts of the crab was off.  I had hoped that the sauce (even though it wasn't the greatest) would permeate the meat inside the crab, but I found the crab to be very unaffected by the sauce smothered on the outside.  WAY too much sauce in that dish for me!The service was pretty bad.  Nobody checking in on us, except for the very end when the meal was over.Kudos to the restaurant though for giving me the option to pay some of the bill with U.S. dollars.  I accidentally left my wallet in the hotel but luckily I had some cash in my pocket but still left me short in Singaporean dollars.  They agreed to let me pay the rest in U.S. currency.  If they refused, I would've had to take a taxi back to the hotel to fetch the $.  Very thankful that they did that for me.As for the crab part of the experience, it definitely fell short for me.  Crab House in San Francisco on Pier 39 is the winner for me.  That is the standard for whole crab.  I guess I'm spoiled."

It was a really good experience but I deducted one star because they have shark fin on the menu and the service was a little lackluster and slow. The salted egg crab (coated in a rich layer of salted egg yolk) was my least favorite. I definitely enjoyed the chili crab (not really spicy at all) but actually found the black pepper crab more interesting in flavor. From the huge choice of appetizers, the scallops and the dragon fruit with lobster stood out the most.  Word of advice: don't wear a white shirt or any piece of clothing you care about.

HALF PRICE off the Chili crab and Pepper and Spiced Salt crab that we ordered. So for that awesome value, I'm adding a star. Dinner was a pretty last minute decision; we only realised that the voucher for 50% off crabs was only valid for April on the 29th of April... so at 8pm we frantically tried calling the Dempsey branch because it was the most central for all of us. As expected of a busy restaurant there was no answer... so we went online and Chope-d our seats. SCORE.Got there, and as we ordered, we were a little disappointed. They'd run out of a few drinks, and didn't have anymore pork ribs. So we ordered two crabs, their scallops wrapped in yam, black-pepper venison, baby kai lan fried with garlic and mantou.I won't talk about the crabs, since everyone does, but I highly recommend the scallops wrapped in yam. The yam is light, crispy, and sweet. While a little overpowering for the scallops, they're still very enjoyable and actually quite addictive. The black-pepper venison was also a pleasant surprise. The black pepper sauce was incredibly rich, fragrant, and really stole the show. We were mopping it up with the mantou instead of using it on the Chili crab. It was THAT GOOD!So all that food, with some drinks... at $50 a head? I MEAN COME ON! That's definitely worth one star right there. I'm just looking forward to the 50% off fresh lobster month. :D"

Nice, but a little forgettable.2) Ditto for the Surf & Turf ($18), juicy fat beef meatballs and baby calamari dunked in a well-rounded tomato-based sauce. We thought it a particularly thoughtful gesture to split them up into 2 portions for us.3) Croquetas ($14):with roasted chicken, the highlight, and insanely good...I'm still dreaming about these babies.4) Miniature Tortillas ($12): may have appeared drab, but turned out simplicity at its finest, delicious and wonderfully nuanced.5) Cod Bunuelos ($18) fritters of mashed Atlantic cod: so well done I hardly noticed the parsley specks weaved into it. I actually thought the parsley balanced out the fattiness of the cod, rather than detracted from it. 6) Fiduea ($32) a Catalan-style noodle paella simmered in a rich seafood stock and aioli: we had differing opinions on this - it may have been a smidge oily and overwhelming with the taste of octopus, but it wasn't as hateful as the Hubs feltPictures are at thehungrybunnie.blogspot…"

One unfortunate thing that happened, as we were sitting beneath the trees, some gross unidentifiable semi-liquid stuff fell on my friend which kind of dampened the experience there, but this is probably and hopefully an unfortunate isolated case."

Don't expect any of that.Instead, expect what you'd expect of a casual pub with a good band.Affordable, good (but not amazing) beer. Some interesting brews, and generally it all goes down easy.Great bar snacks and finger food. Their spicy wings pack a REAL KICK so don't go in cocky. The wedges and other snacks and eats are all perfectly decent. Nothing inedible, nothing gross. I found their Vongole HORRIBLE though, so I'd definitely give that a miss. Previous experiences have established that their other mains are also 'just decent', so generally I recommend eating dinner somewhere else first (and there are so, so many options in the Dempsey area so there's no excuse) and then going to chill out and have beers at Reddot after.The live bands they bring in are alright too. While not always the best singers in the place, they always work hard to engage the crowd, have little gameshow type things, (we won a free beer tower!), and generally really help up the fun factor.So like I said at the start. Don't go to Reddot looking to be disappointed. Go with low expectations, a high threshold for beer, and with friends you want to laugh with. That's the secret sauce."

I noticed how old and tired the place was looking. Nothing has changed outside in 3 years. If anything, service to the outdoor area has gone backwards since the closure of the outside serving station. Beers came in a good order from the inside bar, but the pizzas took an eternity from the kitchen. The Parma ham pizza was passable, but the meat lovers pizza was epically horrible...cardboard base with tomato sauce, topped with ground beef and BBQ sauce drizzled on top with unidentifiable cheese globbed here and there. A sicky sweet awful conglomeration...No pepperoni, no salami, no onions, no herbs...nothing. Avoid eating pizzas here at all costs. And please, spend some money on the outdoor area.

Our party of 4 didn't have a reservation, but luckily we were able to get seated right away.The menu has a good variety of pub grub and pastas, with average prices for Dempsey Hill. I wanted to order a pizza but apparently it wasn't available. I think the waitress mentioned something about pizzas only being served later in the evening? Either way, I was peeved about that, so I ended up not ordering. My husband ordered a seafood pasta of sorts and it was alright, nothing to Yelp about. Our friend's date got the fish and chips, and it also looked decent.However, the service was good, as the place was packed but I don't remember any long waits. Also, they were nice enough to let us move to the smoking area on the patio after the staff dried everything off (I don't know why they weren't prepared for the daily rainstorms we have!)What I really enjoyed was the live music. The first act of the evening was pretty good, 2 guys doing an acoustic act, singing an alternative music set. However, I really liked the second act- a man and woman who just sang with a keyboard. They sounded amazing! Loved their focus on top 40 hits.Overall, not a place to go out of your way for, but good spot for casually hanging out with friends or starting the night out. Also, the only place I know where you can have green beer year round, as opposed to only on St. Paddy's day. :)"

Food 4.5/5we ordered pork ribs that comes with grilled corn and mashed potato, and it is as good as it can get. You can slice through the meat with just the weight of the knife and it melts in the mouth. The mashed potato is very fresh and goes well with the meat, no additional sauce needed. Can't really comment about the corn aside it being fresh since I don't like corn. The next food is prawn risotto which is first class, although I am not a fan of el-dente rice, therefore it is not as enjoyable as it could, but I appreciate the food prep and quality itself. The sauce is perfect, flavorful but not too much, the prawns are fresh and prepped excellently. I give an overall score of 4.5/5 because I haven't tried other options that will make me a regular yet, but will try since it is a nice place to hang out and chill while enjoying a good food and wine. A bit pricey but reasonable with the food quality offered."

I would also add the smoked duck breast and some other cured meats to the mix.If you're not sure what to pair your cheeses with, don't fret. The on-site cheese experts would help you with that. There are also suggested accompaniments placed together with the different types of cheeses on the shelves so you can always pick them out yourself. A starter that is the equivalent of a main course is the Oriental Crispy Duck ($26) which is a pan fried duck confit served on a bed of mesclun salad tossed with shimeji mushroom, Russet potato, cherry tomatoes, and tossed in a plum dressing. Somehow the salad stole the thunder from the duck, which was simply a protein accompaniment that is rather characterless. jones Classic Wagyu Burger With Truffle Fries ($26) is the bomb. Resistance is futile. How can anyone say no to this juicy 120g 100% Australian wagyu beef patty with crispy bacon?! Of course, the various condiments layer on the flavors perfectly- melted gruyere cheese, truffle mayo, bois boudran sauce, pickles, hot English mustard, and caramelized onions. They even make their own fluffy brioche bun which held the stack perfectly. I also had to tell them to take away the fries, if not i would not be able to taste the rest of the food with my limited stomach space. The Asparagus Risotto ($24) was a creamy soft herb risotto with fresh asparagus, Taleggio and rana padano with black truffle oil. Expect this to be very very filling. I couldn't take more than 3 spoonfuls of this as it was rather cheesy, though bland. An enjoyable pasta was the Spicy Seafood Aglio Olio ($28), which was piquant and full of garlic. This dry pasta could do with a larger variety of seafood actually as it was mostly prawns (not that i mind but it did say that it's a seafood pasta). I wouldn't mind finishing a plate of this actually, but i thought the prawns were too powdery.Grilled BBQ Chicken ($26) was succulent and juicy, though pretty standard. The BBQ sauce had a nice hint of apple, which i thought was rather refreshing. That creamy and buttery garlic mash and minty coleslaw were kinda heavy for the dish. So i have found the best Warm Sticky Date Pudding ($15) in Singapore. Seriously this cake was buttery and moist and that salted caramel sauce was the bomb, especially with that rich vanilla bean ice cream. Any dessert after this just couldn't compare. Of course, if you're looking for something small, the freshly baked breads, pastries, and cakes would satisfy your tastebuds. All jones breads are organic and they only use premium ingredients here. So yes, welcome back, jones the grocer now!"

After hopping off the bus and walking allllll the way up Dempsey Hill, I decided to reward myself by indulging in lunch at Jones. (Okay, walking up Dempsey Hill wasn't that bad, but come on, I should get some recognition for not driving or taking a cab out here!) I ordered the leg ham and gruyere cheese sandwich, with zucchini, tomato chutney, and apples. Sounds different and amazing, right?! Well, I was slightly disappointed. I found the sandwich to be a bit small and overpriced. I felt the ham just tasted like ham, the gruyere just like regular cheese, the tomato chutney was sweet but that's it, and the zucchini and apple portion was lacking. Basically, nothing really stood out and the flavors didn't seem to combine well. It was served with a small salad on the side, but I wish it had dressing on it. I did like the bread, as it was toasted perfectly.After paying my check, I decided to look at some of their grocery items. I love how they had a lot of Italian goods like bottled tomato sauces and dried pastas - I've been striking out on finding good Italian restaurants here so I'm always looking for quality ingredients to make my own Italian meals. The cheese room looked amazing but I was a bit intimidated by it. I also loved all the exotic teas they offered.Overall, so-so experience at the cafe, but totally loving their merchandise. This seems like the place to be on the weekends, so I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up here again. Looking forward to my next visit!"

Had to approach one of the waiters, who looked very frazzled and asked us to wait. If not for the rain, would have walked out. Would I go back - maybe if i'm caught by the rain again and have no where else to go."

I especially like the hit of salt with the malty flavor of milo.--everything else was middling-to-great, but the only thing I'd recommend to avoid is the almond panna cotta. over-gelatined and terribly firm, and tasted exactly like the sort you get out of a chinese boxed mix. not great, and almost entirely left untouched.it was a dinner party, at the end of it - so I hope the day-to-day dining is just as fantastic here!"

In fact, you wouldn't even know it's there because no one would randomly walk past this spot in Little India. Morsels serves morsels of food (really small plates) that are largely influenced by Japanese ingredients but it also incorporates a variety of cultures in their dishes.Ingredients are sourced from local farmers and sustainable sources if you are big on that sorta stuff. Here's what we sampled.Must OrdersYou should definitely start with the Hokkaido Scallop Ceviche ($17/25). This is what spring/summer taste like. Cubes of  tangy compressed seasonal plum, salty tobiko and sweet scallops were tossed with cilantro, onion and a refreshing yuzu. It's even more awesome with the homemade tortilla chips which is a cross between a super buttery curry puff pastry and wanton skin. Super love! We ordered a second portion immediately upon tasting this.If you do not wish to have morsels, then the following 3 mains should satisfy your tummy. Ume-sake Braised Short Rib ($30/38) was delectably tender and flavorful. Certainly umami. We especially enjoyed the Okinawan Sweet Potato mash that had a light sweetness to it and wasn't too starchy. Served with crunchy baby Bok Choy, Ume and koji wasabi. Another 2 portion dish!The Firecracker Pulled Pork Conchiglie Pasta ($16/24) was also voted as a top favorite with our group. There's something about the sourish and spicy habenero pesto sauce with the caramelized pulled pork. Neutralize the zing with the dollop of sour cream or just mix it all in. They could do with more meat though. Again, the boys demanded that we order another plate!The Grilled Hungarian Mangalican Pork ($28) wasn't too bad either. Mangalican Pork is really growing in popularity hur! The meat had a very clean un-porkish taste in fact and the cauliflower purée was a great healthy alternative to any cream sauce. We thought the Asian ginger sauce was just a regular BBQ sauce though.The other dishes varies from ok to not too fantastic. Steamed clams in fig broth ($22): OK but not quite worth the priceSquid ink Risotto ($25): Supposed to be a a signature dish too salty and lacking in squid ink flavors. Grilled octopus was good. Pan seared fish with buttermilk miso broth ($24): MEH. Too bland and not too fresh fish. Small portion.Hits and misses at Morsels. The group consensus was that we may come back for the top dishes instead of giving a go at all the funky morsels. We were at 70% stomach capacity at the end of the meal (probably less for the boys) and it was about $35/pax. You'd probably feel more satisfied if you stick to the bigger meals."

Soon after the utensils and banana leaves laid in front of us, chips and rice came after ( with options of briyani or white rice) then potatoes and Dahl and curry (option of fish or chicken curry) scooped next to our rice. Rest came not long. I would give five star for the fish and lime juice ( refreshing, must try). Skip the Bandung, as it's aftertaste aroma overpowering the sweetness of the drinks.

Walked up to the food counter and it was hard not ordering everything that looked good since I was already starving when I got there.Was definitely in the mood for some mutton w/ sauce, and the fish curry was a also must accordingly to all the other reviews.  Plopped down on a table and a banana leave was setup promptly.  Then more and more food just got piled on top!  Love it.Opted for the biryani. Why live life plainly?Fish head curry arrived moments later piping hot.  It's chow time!From some of the other reviews, I got a bit worried about the heat on the curries.  However, first few bites proved the anxiety was unwarranted.  The heat was there, but it was a nice warming heat with no sharp edges.The mutton was not too gamey and the bite was actually quite tender.  The curry/sauce on that tasted bolder than the fish curry, and the texture was also thicker as well.  I would get the mutton again.The fish curry came with a pretty massive piece of fish.  Don't let the whole head thing scare you off.  There's a generous amount of (non-head) meat in there as well.  I think the cut extends to the fish collar point.Perhaps it was because I tasted the mutton first, but somehow the sauce on the fish tasted a bit muted in comparison.  Don't get me wrong, it was still excellent with rice.  It was just different than expected.Overall, pretty solid experience and I find the value aspect pretty good as well.  Will probably head back to check out the chicken and other options next month or so."

It is an institution. I love walking up the stairs and seeing the lush growth of trees that surround the buildin. My mom is not a fan of spicy food, but the guy who brought us to the food display area was able to help us pick some dishes that would accommodate her milder palate. We ordered the tandoori cauliflower dish, the black squid/sotong, chicken masala, fried fish ball (perkedel?) and of course a paneer dish. We opted to not order the fish head curry as it is quite spicy and big to share.Shortly after ordering, somebody comes by with banana leaf (plates), and starts doling out rice, and side dishes. You must order the calamansi lime juice to soothe your mouth. Eating with cutlery is optional.  Everything is delicious. Although not as cheap as you would hope, the food and experience doesn't exist in the US, so I make sure to always visit when I'm visiting."

Which is why the interior of Samy's - well ventilated and unpretentious - came as a surprise. A quick scan of the menu revealed that prices were reasonable, so that gave us free rein to do that overordering thing. The two of us opted for briyani over white rice (duh), one fish head curry turned into three protein-based dishes, and of course we had to get a coconut each to quell the spicy.Briyani Rice, $3.60 - The chickpea-laden basmati rice, tinted yellow and orange with saffron, was fluffy and smelt of star anise and lemongrass. It was good, especially with the creamy dal and lightly spiced fried potatoes, but just shy of brilliant. Still, I was glad I had it on hand to combat the eye-watering spiciness of the fish head curry.Fish Head Curry, $20.00 for a small portion - A concoction of chilli powder, tamarind, mustard seeds and other spices, the spiciness of this powdery curry was of the eye-watering, airway-clogging variety. Tomatoes were used for thickening the consistency of the gravy and gave it a slight tang. The curry also contained hints of the sweetness of angkoli (the colloquial term in this region for red snapper) used.As the dish was served steaming hot and the curry had numbed my tongue, I wasn't sure how the fish actually tasted at first. Having been cooked together with the curry, the fish head here was less tender than what one would find in a typical Chinese fish head curry, where the fish head is steamed first before ladling the curry on top. It was only when the curry had cooled down to near-room temperature that we detected a slightly fishy odour when eating the flesh, which indicated that the angkoli used here wasn't all that fresh.Mysore Mutton (dry), $10 for small portion - Although it shouldn't be a good thing, we were quite relieved when the serving of Mysore mutton turned out to be tiny. Our opinions on this dish were divided. My friend complained that the mutton was dry and tough. I have to agree that the meat could be more tender, but I really enjoyed the aromatic dry curry paste that the mutton had been cloaked in. Consisting of mutton stock fried with (what else but) a whole load of spices and herbs, including powdered turmeric, coriander, fenugreek seeds, cardamom and chilli, the marinade was intense and permeated the mutton thoroughly, and the meat bore no trace of its signature gamey smell. Now I'm curious to try the wet version of this dish - perhaps that would solve the dryness problem?Masala Chicken, $5.00 a piece - What we could agree on was that the masala chicken here was outstanding. Marinated with - you guessed it - too many spices to list, the chicken here was moist and flavourful. There were notes of paprika, garlic, ginger, tomato, cumin, and curry leaves. Flavourful might be putting it lightly; this was a flavour-bomb and an absolute marvel. We threw caution (along with our distended bellies) to the wind and scraped all the meat off the bones.Judging from the numerous tourists we saw in the restaurant, Samy's Curry is the place to go if you're looking to give your foreign friends a 101 on Indian cuisine. Service is quick without being brusque, and the food's above average. You can pop by one of the neighbouring establishments for after-meal drinks as well."

Once you step in, they automatically place a banana leaf in front of you as your plate and you have a choice between biryani or white rice. It's especially nice in this day and age to be eating from a banana leaf, which so many Indian restaurants do not do anymore. It really adds that certain authenticity and light fragrance to your meal. You can then choose your curries and dishes from a display at the corner.

I can't even believe it myself, I had heard so much about this place but it was an insane trick. The three of us show up SO excited to try fish head curry. I should say this was our first banana leaf meal so we didn't totally know how it worked. One of the servers came over to help us order at the front. We said we have never done this before, needed help figuring it out, but that was mainly just wanted fish head curry and ""didn't want to spend $100 or something"". That was an exact quote. Remember that. So he says something like ohhh well there are three of you so you should get this and this, and maybe two of these, they are very small.... and he keeps going on and on and we are like no no no we don't need all of that! Etc etc. Well we sit down and he proceeds to bring enough food for 100 people. The normal dishes of rice, daal, and veggies came automatcally with the banana leaf, but then two orders of chicken curry followed, with multiple orders of chicken masala, tandoori prawns, chicken korma and finally the ENORMOUS CAULDRON OF FISH HEAD CURRY. Don't get me wrong, every item tasted incredibly good. Like, one of the best indian meals I've ever had. But we specifically said no we didn't want all of that food, we wanted the curry and maybe one other thing whatever was enough for 3 people (ps the fish head curry is easily enough for 10 people alone, so they could have just said that the curry would be enough plus though free sides that come automatically). So we felt bad getting angry at him, and though well maybe it's not that expensive anyway (no prices were displayed anywhere). We get our bill and it's over $100 and we freak out. Normally I wouldn't care but since we were on a trip and had a set budget, it was a big deal. We tried to explain to the people who worked there that this was a mistake but they didn't understand what we were saying. Our server suddenly didn't speak english anymore when we tried to reason with him. I only blame the server. I'm sure the business is lovely and the owners are wonderful, we know the food is incredible. So it's all Raman's fault. That's his name in case you see him and want to avoid him at all costs. Sorry guy, this was such a bitchy review but it was such a sad experience.PS For the record, if you go with a few people, stick with one order of fish head curry for SD $27. It is a good value, and it's worth a trip. But seriously just make sure this is all you order. You will still get the banana leaf with rice, daal, and vegetables."

The food is lovely, and the restaurant serves a wide variety. I love that the rice is served over a banana leaf, and is a waiter comes over to your table to pile on as much rice as you want. Samy's is set a midst the greenery of Dempsey, which makes for a lovely dining atmosphere. One complaint that I have is that service might be slightly haphazard at times - though the waiters more than make up for it with their charming smiles."

Rice is served over a banana leaf and that makes the meal a whole lot tastier. Don't ask me why, I don't know either but the food just seems to taste better that way. Rice along with a side of vegetable and potato curry is refillable so eat however much you like. It does gets a little warm with all the spicy food but perspiring is all part of the dining experience! Get an ice cold home-made lime juice to go with your meal!"

The place was a little difficult to find and we eventually found a sign and a set of stairs that led us to their game room area, which had pool and foosball table. The place wasn't busy at all, with only 3 other tables occupied. We got a seat on the patio close to an outdoor play ground for kids.Our server was prompt and polite, but didn't seem to know the answers to many of our questions, such as ""How big is the Caesar salad?"" We started with the Pipsqueak cider ($11) and it hit the spot. Not too sweet and pretty light. Our salads came out about 25 minutes later (I was keeping close track due to ""hangry"" mood and growling stomach), which seemed a bit long due to how few tables they had.I ordered the half roasted chicken with fries and coleslaw ($20.90). The ""hanger"" must have prevented me from keeping it strict Paleo and swapping fries for a salad. That's what I'm choosing to stick with at least. The coleslaw was really a salad with light dressing and not slaw at all. Hubby got the baby back ribs with fries and coleslaw ($24.90). Their special sauce tasted just like McDonald's sweet and sour sauce. We left full, but not really satisfied. The Tree Lizard had fairly expensive, nicely plated bar food. Next time we'll hit up PS Cafe or The Disgruntled Chef in that area. It's a less risky move when suffering from a ""hangry"" mood. This place gets a 2.5 out of 5 stars for me."

They also brought a third main dish (for 2 people) and insisted we had ordered it. Reluctantly they took it away. The chicken was OK but the 'Baby' lamb could not have been any smaller, with very little meat on it - no fries. The vegetable were plain boiled and the size of postage stamps, so the dish took less that 5 minutes to eat - a miserly portion for $32.80! When asked what was wrong the owner offered nothing, but just said 'thanks for the feedback'. We asked for mustard and were given an empty bottle, and they looked offended when we asked for one with some mustard in it. After we paid ($71.33) with a credit card they took a number of tries before getting it to work. How they managed to feature on an online list of recommended restaurants for Valentines Day I will never know. Definitely a place to avoid."

Wine is also reasonably priced. On the other hand, food quality has fluctuated a lot over time. With the current chefs, it's not bad. They do have unusual pasta dishes, like a yummy spinach caserecce or giant riavolis. Seating is a bit close to one another.

We called la forketta dempsey on Saturday (8 Aug) at 1.30pm to check if they had a table for 5 available for lunch. They man on the phone was courteous and agreed to make a reservation for us for 2pm and assured us that they could accommodate us easily. We arrived at the appointed time and after temperature checks, checkin (1:59pm) and hand sanitizing, were ushered to our table, which was set up with 1 high chair already. The friendly server brought over a carafe of ice water and was addressing my toddler son (aged 2.5 years) as buddy. At this point, my son asked me for ice in his normal voice which is the usual excited toddler high pitched voice. I was telling him that he can't have ice, so he asked me for ice 2 more times. This whole exchange would have been over the course of 1-2 minutes. Here is where the unnecessary trauma and discrimination started, which was meted out to us by the owner of the restaurant (Gracie).She came to me and said that my toddler was noisy - she made this judgement in 1 minute apparently! - and that we ought to move to a table in the far corner of the restaurant. At this point I was surprised, because I have heard noisy toddlers, and my son would not qualify in that esteemed category in the 1-2 minutes in which he asked for ice !! I am by no means an over protective parent, and never hesitate to discipline my son if the situation warrants it. However, I will also not reprimand him for having a high pitched toddler voice !!So I politely asked Gracie if la forketta Dempsey was a family restaurant, to which she said 'No'.  My husband pointed out that there was another little boy dining with his family. Gracie then said ""he is quiet. you can't 'control' your child"". All this time she was looking down at us condescendingly, just itching to put us away in an unsightly corner. We asked to speak to the manager and she loftly told us that she was the owner. That's when we realised that it was a waste of our time to talk further and simply chose to leave the restaurant with dignity and dine in a more welcoming restaurant. My checkout read 2:07pm. The craziest discrimination I have ever faced for being judged for being a lousy parent. So parents beware if you choose to dine here and your child chooses to talk even a bit - you shall be swiftly judged and sentenced to be shunted to the corner for being bad!!!"

Great starter, but like I said, needs to be bigger for the price.For the main, got the Crudaiola Pizza ($34.13) which was decent, but became very soggy as the fresh tomato juice continued to seep into the dough.Another beef, add the freaking service charge and GST into the menu prices.

Also, the service was quick and correct since there was a lot of waitstaff available.As the oysters were recommended on social media, I went for two oysters, a chirashi with a selection of sashimi and deep fried shrimp. Obviously I paired it with a jug of sake to make the feast complete. The food was of good quality and I was pleased with my sake (which the waitress helped me pick) so I managed to satisfy my craving.Is it as good as in Japan?

Decor-wise, it doesn't differ very much from the typical Jap restaurant. The food's good though. The aburi sushi scores with its good looks - distinct morsels of yummy-looking sushi. Every piece was tasty, right down to the humble tamago. Only minor gripe is that the chefs were a little too heavy handed with the unagi sauce.   The sashimi was fresh. I liked the wasabi. The grilled beef and beef tongue skewers were surprisingly tasty. Assorted sushi we ordered were all about there. Deserts and desert selection were nothing to shout about though.I didn't pay for dinner (thanks LF!) so not too sure about prices. From what I remembered of the menu, prices were pretty decent. Staff were polite.Guys - if you are inclined towards washing your hands after using the toilet (I know many of you don't), be gentle on the soap dispenser.  A press and soap spurted all over my right sleeve, which took quite a bit of dabbing with paper towels to partially remove.

If you like your sashimi and Aburi sushi, this is really a place to visit. Love the buttery and smooth texture of the fish, indicative of fresh and not frozen fishes. They are served with freshly grated wasabi, which IMO is a indicator of a quality Japanese restaurant. Oyster lovers would be glad to know that the ones served here are ginormous. The mini course or the bento set is really value for money considering the amount and quality of food. Perfect for sharing (for 2) with an additional side dish. Highlight of the meal has got to be the Aburi platter. The meat was simply sublime and each piece was drizzled in a different cream/miso sauce. Perfect torching technique as i've previously highlighted in my Kaiho Sushi review. The kita-komachi rice, one of the best rice in Japan, accompanies the fish, adding that light vinegarish and sweet dimension. The little charred spots bring in some smokiness too."

This places adheres strongly to the axiom 'more spice good, less spice bad'. Our (reasonably-priced) meal was a little on the fiery side, but I'm sure one could ask for the chilli to be toned down. We ordered:- Lady's finger starter -- 3.75/5. There's not too much space for innovation with fried lady's fingers, and this was predictably moreish. Looking back, I would not have ordered this because it is expensive ($9.50 for a small bowl) and served the same function as the free-flow (and free) pappadum. - Chicken Chettinadu -- 4.25/5. This was our only gravy dish that wasn't creamy. Not as spicy as the rest but the just-savoury-enough gravy made a good contrast to the stir-fried dishes. My second favorite dish of the night.  - Chicken Chukka -- 4.25/5. A fragrant bombshell (also, spicy)! My favorite dish! - Mutton Mysore - 3.25/5, a disappointment on the texture front - mutton was way too hard. Spices were good though, but taste profile was quite similar to the chicken chukka (except with cashew nuts).- Palak Paneer - 3.75/5, tasty but not inspiring. This score does not take into account by my personal biases against cheese. - Biryani - 4/5. Biryani is only $1 more than rice, so why wouldn't you get it? I appreciated the vegetable side-dishes that accompanied this dish - cabbage and eggplant - because Indian vegetable mains (in Singapore) do not exhibit much variation, resulting in our orders being primarily meat, so these remedied the fiber deficit. They were both decently-executed too.  Service was an A by Singapore standards -- not only did they give us a small gift because we visited on Deepavali, but I also left my credit card at the restaurant and they called my friend who had reserved the table to return it to me! Next time I return, I would skip the mutton mysore and trying some of the tandoori dishes instead!"

The food is OK, but lacks identity: the menu is less diverse than at the original in Little India; more importantly, it is not refined dining (like Rang Mahal, Song of India, Yantra, Punjab Grill, etc) but due to its minuscule portions, is priced closer to those than to the popular Indian (like Samy's, Banana Leaf, the original Muthu's, etc).

I really admire places that take a chance to bring personality and flavor to a spot and try and be different.  I definitely recommend this place and plan on coming back....just not in the beginning of the night."

All thanks to the fragrance from the truffle oil. Portobello fritters were so crispy, drizzled with truffle oil on the outside and best of all, it wasn't soaked with oil when we bite our way through it!! So good I think I could have a few servings on my own.[2] Sambal Sotong $16.90- These 2 sea creatures were presented to us in a nice char. ""Almost"" grilled to perfection but I thought cooking time could be a little shorter to keep the tenderness of the flesh. The flesh itself tasted slight garlicky and goes really well together with the sambal chilli.[3] Salted Egg Yolk Calamari $13.90- Salted Egg Yolk food items wasn't new to any one of us here, it has been trending for more than a year already. What made LHOD's dish stood out? Their version of salted egg yolk sauce was thick, grainy with salted egg bits and not salty. The proportions of salted egg, curry leaves and chilli were perfect where each individual ingredients did not overshine each other. Great on these breaded calamari! LHOD could consider using this sauce to create new dishes too.[4] Prawn Paste Chicken Wings (4pcs) $15.90- Look at these wings!! Chicken wings were huge and juicy within. Skin deep fried till super crispy, lightly marinated with prawn paste and a dash of herbs. A pity the marinade did not penetrate into the meat completely otherwise they would have tasted even better.[5] Drinks:[a] Iced Chocolate $7.90- My kind of drink but it wasn't chocolatey enough for me. I preferred thicker sinful ones.[b] Green Garden Fruit Fizzies $8.90[c] Pink Passion Fruit Fizzies $8.90[d] Lavender Blue Fruit Fizzies $8.90[e] Sunny Day Fruit Fizzies $8.90- These non-alcoholic thirst quenchers were more interesting. Pretty colors and interesting flavours made us couldnt make up our mind which to try first. We ordered the 4 most popular ones to try out. My favorite was the Pink Passion Fruit Fizzies. I love slight sourish drinks as it gave me more appetite to eat more!Mains:[6] Big Breakfast $16.90- For this price we paying, portion served was really generous. Scrambled egg was done pretty well, just the way I love my eggs to be. The spinach and mushrooms were a little salty but they definitely complement the bread well. Served all day![7] Seabass wif Salad $34.90- Fish meat was firm and succulent. Pretty to my eyes and tasty on my palate. The chef made the pan-fried potato balls looked like scallops, Genius! My 2nd most loved mains for the night.[8] Pork Ribs wif Salad $32.90- Whenever I order pork ribs, I'm most concerned with the tenderness of the meat and the sweetness level of the marinates. Lucky this plate didn't disappoint me. The marinates wasn't overly sweet and carried off a smokey aftertaste. The meat fell off bones easily, tender and nice.[9] Spaghetti Laksa Prawns $26.90- Tadahhhh.. My vote goes to this spaghetti laksa prawns for best dish tonight. Look at the huge prawns we were given! Very fresh and crunchy. The spaghetti texture was al dente and every mouthful you could taste the spiciness of the sauce. I love the fiery kick from the laksa sauce, but I could take something spicier. If only the sourish from the tomato base could reduce, I believe the laksa taste would outstand more. Nevertheless, this was still my top choice :)[10] Chilli Crab Bun $19.90- Who don't love crabs? Everyone on this table loved them! Chunks and chunks of generous crabmeat were made into patties and served to us in a delicious bun made in-house. Look at the Chilli crab drizzle, so generous and everything overflows! We almost licked up the plate *haha*[11] Pulled Pork Sandwich $17.90- If we compared this pulled pork sandwich with the chilli crab bun, the former crabby was so much better. Pulled pork was too dry and tough for my liking. Overall lacked the juiciness of meat which I found it a pity. Desserts:[12] Sticky Date Pudding wif Vanilla Ice Cream $13.90- Sticky date pudding was so good, we wiped it out in seconds. Every mouthful you can taste the fragrance of dates. Beware: It could get very sweet if you pair with the bananas given but we gals dun care! Whack!![13] Creme Brulee $10.90- Tofu-liked vanilla custard base was smooth and slippery, eventually disappeared after touching our tongues. The torched sugar crust gave it more flavour. I would say it's a common item which can do with or without.[14] Vanilla Bloom Pot $6.90[15] Pandan Rose Bloom Pot $6.90- These mini pots piped so beautifully with flower petals attracted us at first sight! Almost too pretty to eat them. Vanilla bloom pot tasted less sweet with a very nice milky flavour and fluffy sponge cake below. As for Pandan Rose, the frosting was too sweet although it smells good. But I couldn't finish the first mouthful. The Pandan cake below was slightly dense too. This flavour definitely for the sweet toothies only."

The decor is very pretty, chic and cosy. The warm, light colours are used for the furniture and walls. There's even a play corner for kids to hang out, while parents watch them and have some savoury mains, sides, cakes or ice cream and waffles from Ben & Jerry's. I love that you can order items from both places and dine in a single location.Sambal Sotong $16.90Beautifully plated, this was an interesting menu item that you don't normally get to see in cafes. The squid itself had a chewy texture with a characteristic earthly flavour. The squid also maintained a slightly charred aftertaste. As I'm a weakling when it comes to spicy food, I did not try the sambal sauce.Prawn Paste Chicken Wings (4 pcs) $15.90We were expecting drumlets and winglets but we were surprised to see 4 full chicken wings in a basket. On first impression, the prawn paste aroma was evident. But upon the chicken wings cooling down to  a temperature which we could consume it at, the prawn paste taste was nowhere to be found. The skin was however, superbly crispy and the meat was juicy without being oily. No need to rush to the washroom to wash your hands after consuming this chicken wings!3. Salted Egg Yolk Calamari $13.90 *Highly Recommended*I loved salted egg and I love calamari, hence this is one of my highly recommended dishes to try at Little House of dreams. The salted egg yolk sauce was creamy and yet slightly grainy and lumpy, coupled with a distinct aromatic flavour that had a mild salty-spicy aftertaste. I just couldn't stop munching on these! Even though, these calamari rings sat for awhile, during the photoshoot, despite being being soggy, the presence of the salted egg still stood out clearly.6. Ribeye Steak with Salad $39.90I usually liked my steak medium, but this was medium-well and I still liked it. The steak was juicy and tender and together with the provided steak sauce, this was a  very appetizing. The salad had little sliced baby potatoes which I felt was an interesting way to present carbs on a plate, without making the plate look cluttered with carbs.8. Pork Ribs with Salad $34.90The pork ribs were thick, meaty and succulent. The meat was tasty but just like the pulled pork, it could've been a bit more tender. The sauce was sweet and tangy and perfectly marinated deep into the meat.9. Spaghetti Laksa Prawns $26.90Simple ingredients and yet exploding with flavours.  The prawns were huge but the gradual follow up with the spicy intensity didn't allow me to taste the prawns.10. Chilli Crab Bun $19.90 *Highly Recommended*The chilli crab patty was made with real crab meat, the sauce itself wasn't spicy and kids could probably eat this too! The chilli crab bun was certainly a satisfying and enjoyable one. The bun was toasted till the ends of the bun was crisp and pillowy in the center. The chilli crab sauce topped the crab patty with a sweet and tangy taste contributing to a shiok and yummy satisfaction level.  The crab patty was also well marinated, tender, and flavourful.14. Vanilla Bloom Pot $6.90 *Highly Recommended*This was so pretty! So much effort is made by Little House of Dreams to give you the unique dessert experience. This is actually a cupcake dressed up as a potted plant. The creme on top, was alright in sweetness factor. The cupcake on the inside was on the drier side but tasted great, when combined with the creme. I'll probably be craving for this in the d18. Snickers Cheesecake $7.90 *Highly Recommended*The owners mentioned that if you like nuts, or snickers, you'll be a fan of this cheesecake. That was me and I knew immediately that I had to try this. Indeed, this cheesecake was filled with nuts, caramel, chocolate and a chocolate cookie handmade crust. The cheesecake was dense, but not overly sweet. I wasn't  expecting this to be spectacular but it sure was!19. Lavender Blue Fruit Fizzies $8.90All the fruit fizzies are ingeniously thought out. My Lavender Blue Fruit Fizzie was made with lavender and little iced cubes with real strawberries on the inside."

We tried the lemon meringue tart, yummy but $9 a pop!! Perhaps their focus is more on their desserts, their savory menu is really lacking in quality. Service was bad too. Don't think it's worth a second visit. Came here on a Friday morning and it was relatively empty. But was surprised that service was still extremely slow. We seated ourselves, the server saw us but did not even approach us and just stood around. We asked for information regarding several things (menu, availabilities etc.), and she had to go ask someone else multiple times - she didn't seem to know what's going on. They do not have physical menus, everything is on the iPad. Our party of 4 had to squeeze together to browse a small screen. Their digital menu seems pretty poorly planned out too - they only have brunch items available on weekends and public holidays, but it was featured under their ""Popular"" section which didn't indicate the availability of the items. New items that were featured on their little posters were not on the iPad and, quote the server, we were supposed to ""just order from the iPad"", but how?Food is just ok. They arrived way too slowly... We got appetizers, salad and main dishes. The main dishes came first. We didn't understand why our main dishes came out before the appetizers, and the salad was the last to arrive.Seems like a cute place to have brunch at, and a nice place to hang after work as it seems like they have live music occasionally. But if the service was already so bad when it wasn't very crowded, can't imagine when it is."

We didn't try the bakery goods, but the unimaginative savoury dishes range from bad to barely acceptable. For lunch, the kitchen only opens at 12:30 pm. With so many alternatives in the Dempsey area, why bother? And why do the owners wastefully put an iPad at every table, when it says ""For Staff Use only"". Incidentally, the staff are very friendly when they appear, but alas they are largely absent. Pricey for what it is - without the Entertainer offer, would be pretty bad value."

We were in the mood for burgers, and although we heard Huber's Butchery serves some good ones, we weren't interested in eating al fresco because it was so frikken hot!Hungry and desperate for air conditioning, we spotted Go-Go Bambini and liked what we saw on the menu. In addition to burgers, they also had salads and pizzas. Walking in we were a bit confused- why are there so many children here and OMG that's a huge playground! (Then my Italian brain popped in- bambini means children... ah, I see what they did there.)I think Go-Go Bambini's concept is genius here in Singapore, and I'm surprised there aren't more places like it. It's a family friendly establishment in upscale Dempsey that allows children to run around freely in an indoor playground as the adults chow down on gourmet food offerings! Of course, they also have a children's menu, and all items from it are served on durable plastic plates and cups so nothing breaks.My husband ordered the GGB (go-go bambini) burger, which is basically a bacon cheeseburger topped with a fried egg. It's quite epic, and good if you're super hungry! I had the cheeseburger. I found it juicy and well seasoned. I also liked the fries that came with it.If I could change one thing, it would be the glass sizes for adults. They served us water in what could be a considered a big shot glass in certain bars. Since you pay when you order, the staff didn't really check on us after our food was served. We had to work to flag them down so they could refill the glasses for us.Other than that, this is a nice spot to check out. If you're single, don't let the children scare you away- the food here is worth checking out!"

Although on the more expensive side, the quality is undeniably worth it. The MAO SHAN WANG and KING OF KINGS were both sooo flavorful - sweet and slightly bitter. The King of Kings being slightly more bitter and drier.The stand offers seating and free water which is definitely needed to counterbalance the richness of flavor. They also provide plastic gloves for eating so your hands don't smell too much haha."

These were far better. There is seating under shade and a fan on to keep cool. The staff was friendly and seemed happy to watch us all enjoy their fruit.

Word is, according to Dad, our Emeritus Senior Minister Goh gets his durians from this stall too. Because of the quality of durians from this stall, I never ate a durian from another stall, ever, because I didn't want to pay for durians, and I am not a pro like Dad at choosing durians.I remember getting a shock at the ripe old age of 23 when I first bought durians from a random stall, because I was so used to the quality of durians from this place that your usual durian just paled in comparison.This place is quite inaccessible, you should probably drive here."

I even saw an Indonesian matriarch waiting in her huge mercedes back seat while her grandchildren and daughter personally helped packed many many styrofoam boxes of durians and oversaw them being laminated shut in plastic with a portable laminating machine that Ah Di keeps handy..just so other rich Indonesians back home wouldn't miss out. I remember thinking..well that's her pickup from the airport guaranteed there! And yes she was so concerned, she opened the car window so she could lean out and make sure her progeny were packing it right!Ever since I broke my jaw years back and had to subsist on a diet of smashed fish and carrot porridge and painstakingly cut up ramen (brought my own scissors to Miharu)..and durian every week for several months..I've been a regular here.Because let's face it, there's not many things that you can get the full flavour of without chewing. So Miharu aside as a weekly treat, I was having durian..2 or 3 times a week.My favourites are the King of Kings (Wang Zong Wang), Red Prawn (Hong Xia) and Nai Wang (Milk King). People complain it's pricey but my tip is, ask for the durians with the small seeds. Then you're not paying for the heft of the thorny shell but for a payload of very creamy copious pure durian flesh. It may not be cheap but my family and I (and friends we bring) often remark even nowadays how good the durians are.Lovely people serving it too."

Wait a minute! did i miss the arrival of the durian truck in that short 8 minutes?at that point i can't help but feel rather cheated especially when the king of kings that I'm having weren't exactly that fantastic for the price i paid - it also didn't have the small seeds like the lady boss said it had when she presented the durian to us at the table. In addition their red prawn durian was more fragrant than ours because i could actually smell it when it arrived at their table...i guess it's no surprise that i stopped eating after 3 seeds.the name of the stall is Wan Li Xiang and the contact person is Ah Di.I think for now I'll just keep Ah Seng as my friend."

Very interesting combination of flavours and the sweet and fragrant notes of both fruits paired together worked for me. It's sort of like a twist to the popular strawberry-orange flavours.The truffle fries are really good, I liked that their fries were thicker but not too chunky so you have a good amount of crispy and soft potato inside. The truffle oil was really fragrant and the shaved parmesan cheese added a great salty tinge to the flavours and bite.

At $30 for a big pot, we got one each and were left stuffed. There is a live band that plays music inside, and they're pretty decent, so that's a nice accompaniment to dinner. I'd say that because of the noise level and the crowd, it's the kind of place you head to with friends and not a first date.The only cons about the place is that it is slightly on the pricey side, getting a cab is a bitch if you don't drive and it's a little out of the way.Otherwise, if you're looking for somewhere laid-back on a Friday night, this might be an option."

We would bring our laptops (free wifi and power plugs!) and work there all day (it's relatively quiet before dinner). It's also good for any meal. My favorite dishes include the black pepper crab aglio olio, wagyu beef chili and lobster and crab ""tacos"" (note: they are actually dips with nachos). Their waffles and burgers are also popular among my friends. I haven't found any item on the menu that I did not like. It's also great for after dinner drinks. I love their ginger fizz, old fashioned mojitos and lychee mojitos. The bartenders are also very obliging with drink requests. One of my favorite cocktails came out of asking for something with lychee and choya. CM-PB is also a favorite for pre-gaming nights. Umm, our favorite bartender, has given us 10 free shots on more than one of our pre-clubbing stops there. They used to have good live music too (especially when 53A was still playing there). I don't go for the live music anymore but the bands are usually enjoyable. There are huge pluses for being regulars too!

A friend and I went there for dinner one evening and we were quite impressed with the way the place looked. The indoor sitting was a little rustic, a little cool and chic with a large bar in the middle of the room. It was quite a cool night and the outdoor sitting looked really nice and romantic. It was a waste I wasn't there with the boyfriend. It would have made a pretty romantic date.The menu was a pretty pricey, but we heard that the food was good so I was pretty prepared to pay. Unfortunately, the food did not impress. I had a french onion soup for starters and duck confit for mains and we had a serving of truffle fries to share. While the french onion soup was pretty good, with a generous serving of gruyere cheese, the duck confit was a huge let down. The meat was tough and bland and the sauces on the side failed to lift its flavour and texture. The serving was pretty small too. According to my friend, I was frowning continuously as I ate. The truffle fries were nothing to shout about as I have had better ones elsewhere for a lower price. As the food was pretty bad, we decided to head elsewhere for desserts.While I was initially impressed with the looks of the restaurant, the food changed my mind entirely. It is a pretty pretentious restaurant that charges exorbitant prices for sub-standard cooking. There are many better choices in the dempsey area."

This changed when a fellow foodie friend raved about The Dempsey Brasserie so we decided to make it our brunch destination for the weekend. Food : We were hoping for the full menu on top of the weekend brunch one, as we had heard many good things about several items on it. However, we were informed the full menu only kicked in at 330pm so we had to stick to the brunch items. We couldn't really decide what to order (mini Angus burgers? The highly recommended fish and chips? The big breakfast?) so we decided to order a few dishes to share. In the end we settled on the French onion soup, the big breakfast and the fish and chips, as well as an iced mocha and elderflower fizz to round it off. The fish and chips disappeared quickly as it was delicious and we were ravenous. We opted for truffle fries, which came crisp and golden. The fish too, was fresh and delightfully complemented by the Stella Artois batter and lemon aioli. We loved the Cumberland sausages and the superbly done bacon (perfect balance between crisp and nicely chewy), and our scrambled eggs were nicely fluffy. We also scarfed down the French onion soup with its thick Gruyere cheese and crostini ... one of the better French onion soups we've had in a while. The iced mocha too was well made, and the elderflower fizz had a refreshing zing to it.Ambience : Lovely! Like a NY style brasserie in the meatpacking district. Though we would have preferred they play jazz or something quieter instead of Robbie Williams belting about how he wanted to feel real love.Service : Wonderful! Polite, prompt and attentive.Definitely going up on my list of favourite brunch places. Will be back to try the full menu."

I love supporting local businesses, especially one that tries to push the boundaries of modern Singaporean cuisine. Unfortunately I have to say the fusion dishes didn't quite blow our minds and the non-fusion dishes were good. Ha!I had a work dinner at Pidgin last night with 4 colleagues and we mostly ordered off the set menu, which seemed to encapsulate most of the best hits. Before I review everything I have to say the portions are generous so I'm not sure how Aileen N concluded that they were small.For starters, I had the crab otak croquette, which smelled like otak but didn't quite capture the rich chilli and coconut flavors you'd expect in the meat itself. The accompanying sauce apparently had chye poh but for the most part, it tasted like tartar. My Aussy colleague tried the tuna tartare and he seemed ok with it for the most part.Next I attempted the roasted beetroot salad with local goat cheese. The dish kind of worked together but curiously, the beetroot slices didn't taste or feel roasted. It was basically beetroot with a big slab of mostly sainte-maure and some salad leaves on top - and somehow the flavors didn't come together very elegantly. I'm guessing the sainte-maure was quite young because it was creamy rather than chalky and not overly piquant.On to the mains, I had the prawn capellini (I guess they've downgraded it from more pricey seafood stock) and one of my colleagues had the duck confit. My colleague said the duck was excellent and the sauce was wonderfully rich. My noodles, which are supposed to be a fusion take on wanton mee, tasted..umm...like not so awesome wanton mee? I think the stock and sauce for the noodles needed to be more robust because it felt very flat, though I did like the slices of chorizo iberico and green chilli. The wantons were fat but all I could taste was the well-fried skin as opposed to the supposed tiger prawns hiding in there. Arg I really wanted to like this!At least dessert was largely pleasurable all round with everyone enjoying the milo dinosaur and kaya bread & butter pudding, though the latter did come out a little dry. Just based on my glancing through the dinner and brunch menus, I get the feeling that Pidgin has a little identity crisis. Because the mod-sin dishes aren't successfully pushing the envelope (see Wild Rocket's laksa linguine as an example of success), it's not making money on those dishes and it looks like the chef has acquiesced to the crowd with items like eggs benedict (yawn), duck confit, lamb rack and a steak (double yawn). I'm sorry if I'm being harsh here but if you want to be a mod-sin restaurant than go all the way. Also, while the servers were attentive (there were only 3 covers anyway), they could've have championed the menu a little better by asking us if we'd been to the restaurant before and explain what makes Pidgin's kitchen special. I hope Pidgin stays in business but to do that, the owners need to figure out what their selling and sell it well."

It's worth the wait and price given the environment, location, service and the flavors of the dishes. Just make sure you plan ahead in terms of transportation if you don't have a car. Can be a bit hard to get a ride late at night. To be 100% honest I didn't have super high expectations because having moved to Singapore form NYC, the fine dining scene in Singapore hasn't been able to compare. The ambiance and plating have always been beautiful but usually I find the flavors to be lacking and overall not worth the price. In the case of Claudine, I really enjoyed all the dishes. Even if they weren't mind blowing, they are 90% there across the board which I can't say for any other fine dining place I've been to thus far.-Mozambique langoustine: dumplings are delicious and langoustine is perfectly cooked. The soup itself though is less on the bisque side and more... buttery? It was a bit too rich to finish - Cromesquis pork trotter: delicious but be sure to eat it hot, looooove the sauce that comes with it. Has a good kick. Comes with 5-6 pieces -Vol au vent: I think everyone who comes here should get it. It is absolutely delicious and spot on with the layers of salvors. The right amount of richness and saltiness. The pastry itself was the best part, definitely eat it before it get soggy. I don't typically like sweetbread but this wasn't overly gamy / offal like. - Chou farci: recommended for 3-4 people. The pieces themselves aren't big but it is SUPER rich because of the foie gras. So be prepared - Rhum cake dessert: I was really surprised at how balanced this dessert was. The cake itself is the right level of fluffy, the whipped cream is not overly sweet, and the orange (maybe pomelo? grapefruit) adds an acidic element and great texture. It's pre-soaked in rum but not overly so. They bring out a bottle for you to add more as needed"

Of all time. Even compared to the Malaysian yong tau foo I have been eating in the last 3 years when I lived in KL (they were very good but not as good as this one).I don't understand Singaporean yong tau foo, usually. The soup tends to be so bland and water-like, the stuff too boring and tasteless. The noodles... oh don't even get started. Boring. I swear I have serious food rage when I see cocktail sausages in YTF.Yong Xiang XIng is one of those hawkers that have made it and who do something so well they only work limited hours. Between 1.30pm and 5pm everyday, though, you can have some of it. The queue is mad, always, there are no English words at all on the signboard. Just go to People's Park Centre food centre on the ground floor and look for the long queue that's at a shop with only large Chinese words on its sign.You'll probably be surprised to find that they do things very differently here. One, you cannot choose the yong tau foo pieces you want. Two, there is absolutely nothing in the YTF other than soup and YTF. Not even noodles. I honestly think you will get punched in the face by the grumpy old men here if you asked for either. They're THAT sort of grumpy perfectionists."

Herbal soup is very traditionally prepared, a foreign friend of mine commented that the herbal soup is the best dish served.Restaurant is tucked at a corner of the basement, there's no crowd patronising the area at all. All the customers came in huge groups of around 10 pax (via reservation, not walk in)... surprisingly with youngsters being the majority. Pricing is on the higher side, with a plate of vegetables costing around $13.90. They serve ala carte buffet at $19.90/pax. With a good buffet variation and pricing like that, buffet is worth a try!"

The price is quite reasonable and the portion is decent. The dishes are like the typical Chinese cook food that you would order in other restaurants but this place is vegetarian. Each dish average about $8 with some more exotic dishes in the $15-$16 range. Their chrysanthemum tea uses actual flower and not in a tea bag like some other restaurants. They charge $8 a pot.I like the Bamboo Pitchs with kai-lan, Hong Kong style fried noodles, Hot spicy monkey head mushroom, and salad prawns roll. The restaurant also serves steam rice if you prefer over noodles or fried rice. They even have bento box style if you prefer those.Since it was a quiet evening the ambiance is nice.

It was founded in 2014 by Sarah and Michelle, two good friends and pâtissières with a similar dream and passion. The ladies traveled across the globe to Le Cordon Bleu Paris where they spent nine months learning the art of French pastry. They then returned back to Singapore and started with pop-up stores and finally settled on a in-town location.Their interior is very glossy and shiny, with marble like decor and a simple round table as the epicentre of the store as you walk in towards to the eclair display and ordering counter.It's so hard to pick an eclair!!Behold! The holy display of eclairs. They are all so pretty and you can definitely tell alot of time went into meticulously placing all these decorations/toppings onto the eclairs. They were all neatly aligned in the display.The eclairs had toppings that helped distinguish what eclairs they were. Like the Isaphan eclair had a rose petal on it, which I felt was very cute and creative of them. As you walk down the eclair display, it's almost as if you're admiring a display of art work!Most of their eclairs are priced between $7.50-$8.50 1. Isaphan Eclair $8.50Filled with a light rose cream, embedded with fresh raspberries  and cut lychees, this is my favourite eclair! I have never tasted an eclair quite like this. The aroma of the sweet rose smell is also very pleasant and actually, due to it, I couldn't really smell anything from the other eclairs. The rose cream was subtly sweet and with the sourness from the raspberries, blended well together.2. Green Tea Eclair $8As a matcha lover, I had higher expectation of this, but then again. Real matcha isn't supposed to be sweet. The matcha cream here had a very slight matcha taste to me. The outer chocolate layer was so much sweeter that it was all that I could taste. A slight disappointment here, but this green tea eclair is on their seasonal list, so maybe it won't stay in the eclair display for long.3. Earl Grey Eclair $8Another eclair that I had high hopes for as an earl grey lover. I liked that they played fresh blueberries on top with earl grey infused chocolate. The chocolate was so yummy. The cream on the inside was infused with earl grey as well and was the perfect cream for the eclair. Now if only sarah and michelle can make a thai milk tea eclair, that would be heavenly! I needed like 5 of these, it was that good!4. Hazelnut Praline Eclair $8The hazelnut praline eclair stood out from the rest of the eclairs on display because of it's choux au craquelin top! It was filled with valrhona hazelnut cream and roasted hazelnuts. There were alot of roasted hazelnuts in this one. Any hazelnut lover would be extremely pleased with this eclair. The hazelnut cream here was one of the sweeter ones in comparison to the rest that I had tried.Eclairs!!!At L'eclair, they insist on using top quality ingredients to produce the finest tastes and flavours. Each piece is lovingly assembled by hand which are generously filled and delicately garnished with utmost precision. All of these attributes to beautifully hand made eclairs that taste just as beautiful!I can safely say that this place is probably going to be a hit with the ladies. Being how pretty these eclairs are!!!  You can also order these eclairs online whenever you have the craving. Their nearest mrt is Dhoby Ghaut, so it's not too far off for anyone to reach. Verdict : Their eclairs are not just special in appearance! They are also spectacular in taste! The eclairs are a work of art and though at $8 a pop, I feel it is worth the money!"

Blueberries, gold dust and chocolate covered the top. Oh well - it's still pretty enough, I'll accept the blueberries. On to the taste. You have this eclair with a slightly soggy chewy outer portion and then earl grey custard like cream oozing out. It was alright. I didn't really like how soggy the pastry was.

It's definitely a good time to be in Singapore as we see a couple of international burger chains opening its outlet here in our tiny republic. Shake Shack landed in Jewel earlier this year, we then have Amsterdam based Lombardo's burger and now - Five Guys.  Five Guys is located in Plaza Singapura - ground floor facing the main road. The ordering system is pretty much hassle-free like any burger joint. You queue up (what's new, it's Singapore we queue up for everything!), walk to the counter, order and wait for your burger as the very efficient kitchen staffs do the works. While waiting, help yourself to free flow of groundnuts and a good playlist of songs ranging from rock to RnB and current top 40. I ordered the double cheeseburger with ""all the way"" toppings, a tiny fries, and a chocolate milkshake. While it's a satisfying meal, it doesn't come cheap. Just like Shake Shack, you can't top-up to a meal here. You order everything separately. I paid $35 for the 3 items and felt that it's on a higher side. Cheeseburger is good - juicy succulent patty, fries a tad too oily for my liking and milkshake is solid. Being a glutton myself, ordering these 3 is a mistake. It's too much. So I would recommend to order a burger and complete your meal with either fries or milkshake. Unless you're really a big eater. Overall, I wouldn't mind a meal here from time to time as the burger is good and the restaurant vibe is lively and a great place to catch up with friends and loved ones."

However, I'll jump into the issue. I've been here four times and the first three visits were wonderful. The food was cooked as ordered with all the right condiments; great tasting. The milkshake was prepare the way shakes should be. But this fourth visit was a disappointment. The shakes were as liquidly as heavy cream (we ordered three shakes and all were like that). The person behind there making the shakes on 24 Jan. 2020 at 6:30 pm should not be doing that job. Putting bbq sauce on the edge of the bun doesn't qualify as a condiment. I also asked for grilled onions and instead received raw onions. I, fortunately,  know this can be chalked up to a bad visit this go-around. But if this was new customers' experience, they may never return. Please be better and stay above the norm. This is truly a good place to eat."

It came with high expectations (both Yelpers as non-Yelpers recommended this place) and was a bit afraid that it would be a let down but this concept is just plain awesomeness.Is it the best sushi I ever had? Nope* but they offers good quality sushi at a decent price and the concept is fantastic. As previous reviews described, this is Sushi meets Subway and coincidently I love sushi and I am a subway fan so this restaurant was right up my alley.I am a big fan of the possibility to customize your dishes (yes I am THAT person who takes longer to order a starbucks drink than to drink it) and I am always having a hard time picking sushi as I always end up thinking: ""this roll has xyz that I love but I wish it came with abc which comes in this other roll..."". Maki-san solves that problem by letting you design your own roll. For eternal doubters as myself it is still a chore as it creates even more choices but it gives you a strange sense of empowerment.I went for the combo which included a mega-san, a canned drink and a snack which came in under 13 S$. My roll was super tasty (maybe because it hit all the right spots since I could pick my own ingredients ) and the snack I chose was super delicious! I would have never expected that crab stick tempura would be something I would rave about but the dough was super light & fluffy and the cheese dip which I picked for it made it a match in haven.Although I have rated it the full five stars I do have some minor points of criticism:1) it is filled with teenagers which made me feel out but a) this is not maki-sans fault; b) it might be due to the time of the day and location (film theatre on a Saturday late afternoon) and c) I might just having to accept that I am getting older...2) I like to drink a lot with my food, in the meantime I have accepted that in Singapore there is seldom a bottomless soda but since there is quite a queue it is difficult to purchase an extra drink if you want a refill so a soda fountain /a water dispenser would be welcome, or even a way to purchase another drink without having to queue in the food queue.Overall this place is amazing. I was going to start a petition: ""I want Maki-San at Holland V"" but I figured it would lead me to go there more than once a week  and not eat anything else anymore so I am happy for now since the Cathay is not too far away either.* in case you are wondering what for me the best sushi is: without a doubt I would pick a place in Japan. No competition possible, sushi is just so much better there."

The tempura crunch was a good choice and it was very crispy instead. The prawn roe was rather fresh and the prawns were fresh and crunchy. The brown rice was also a nice healthy touch to the maki so I rarely see japanese maki with brown rice.All in all, a good choice for a quick lunch but a little-san to me, is still too big for me to finish on my own.

The miso dressing paired with corn, the lemon included in the egg wrap and cream cheese and salmon roll allow me to safely say that Maki-San is a Japanese fusion restaurant/cafe. The brightly colored walls, cartoon artwork, sensitive music, and sushi rolls wrapped like a present leads me  to my final conclusion, that this restaurant is designed for young girls. I spent 30 minutes in the cafe and all the customers were female, half were wearing school uniforms. The artwork depicting angry ingredients with the slogan, ""if you don't like it, take it out!"" Illustrates just how customizable the menu is for picky eaters or those with diet restrictions."

It's a good thing they have an efficient ordering system. You mark the item number on the ordering pad and press the bell when you're ready. I ordered the nasi lemak with beef rendang. It was delicious. The rice had a coconut flavor and complemented the curry very well. It was pretty good combo for the price too. I also ordered the cendol.

Shreds of kangkong, julienned chicken breast, squid with a sloppy fried egg plopped and crunchy ikan bilis, the grains might not look refined but won our hearts with the arresting wok-hei aroma and well-seasoned taste. The Sweet & Sour Crab Meat with Fried Rice $11.90 is Papparich's founder, Rich Tan's interpretation of the Singapore Chilli Crab. An experimental work that missed the mark for the sauce was too sweet and lacked depth. For those who used to the tangy Assam Fish Head, the Red Snapper Curry Fish Head $34.90 may lack the punch. But this Indian-Middle Eastern inspired fish pot is no less intriguing and mesmerizing. The clever use of 22 spices such as kunyit, buah keras (candlenut) and biji halba (fenugreek seed), bolstered the coconut milk-based curry broth, giving it a full-bodied, robustness. Not keen on the fish head? there is also the fish fillet version. It's sort of a déjà vu encounter with the Ayam Masak Merah $12.90, which uses similar ingredients and cooking techniques like the Chinese Stir fry pork Gu Lu Rou (咕噜肉) . The adoption of chicken thigh instead of pork levelled the tenderness but the flavours of the sauce could be teased out further.The two unstoppable dishes were the Sambal Aubergine $9.90 and the Four Heavenly Kings in Sambal Belacan $11.90. Deep-fried till beautifully blistered on the skins, tossed and coated in Sambal hot chilli, the Sambal eggplant is a truly venerable rendition and the BEST I've encountered so far. The Four Heavenly Kings, represented by ladyfingers, long beans, eggplants and petai, faced off one another in a spicy formidable battle intensified with the deadly yet assertive belachan paste."

Arrived at Plaza Singapura around 1pm and managed to park the car within minutes.Reached the store close to 1pm and surprisingly the store was not crowded. In fact it was half full. Get seated pretty quickly and upon seating, my family and I were given menus to look at.As a newbie at this chain, I was not aware that there are electronic bells attached to the set of cutleries. I was also not aware that there were notepad (a list of menu) with pencil on the middle of the table. So, yes, if you are a newb like I do, please take note of that - bell to call upon the servers and notepad to order the food and drinks (just like in a Chinese dim sum restaurant).Upon browsing the menu, the dish that caught my eyes is R-04 (Super Rich set) and Mango Mania for the drink.The dish came out much quicker than expected (within 10 minutes). Super Rich set consist of Nasi Rich (Nasi Briyani), fried chicken, braised beef also known as rendang, sweet & spicy squid, a piece of potato, half of hard boiled egg, lady finger, papadum (crackers) and chili (sambal). I like all the small dishes besides the lady finger (don't really like the sticky texture inside it). The portion was rather big. Was expecting a smaller portion but managed to consume it all. I have to give credits to the squid as it was well cooked and it has a chewy texture that I love. Overall, it was a great combination.For the drink, Mango Mania is blended mango slush with longans, watermelons and nata de coco (coconut jelly). The overall taste is perfect for my liking.Will definitely come back to this place for food as well as the ambience. Selamat makan (Enjoy your food - Bon Appetit)!"

I'd asked to hold off the parsley/spring onions/coriander, and they took off ALL of the vegetables...my noodles missed their beansprouts and kangkong.Notwithstanding the woefully lackadaisical service, the Malaysian fare at PappaRich was pretty commendable. We'd been craving the Hokkien mee back in Penang, and PappaRich's rendition did well in scratching that itch.We had:1) Chicken Satay (8.90 for 6): so succulent and flavourful, it rendered the accompanying peanut sauce redundant.2) Pappa Prawn Mee ($9.90): a lovely blend of rich shrimp stock and chilli spice, generously studded with fresh prawns and poached chicken slices. The robust broth was wonderfully comforting on a cool rainy night.3) Pappa Fried Mee ($8.90): imbued with the smoky accent of the wok, was equal parts sweet and spicy and savoury. It wasn't the most outstanding, but it passed muster.4) Pappa Chicken Chop with Curry Sauce ($12.90): beautifully crisp skin.

Yet the meat was reasonably tender despite not being that thick, which speaks to the skill of the chef.The miso soup had a clean taste and a certain sweetness. It was definitely not from a packet like most places, where the miso soup tastes like it all came from the same factory in Japan. Garnished with fresh spring onion, it certainly had its own character. The chawanmushi was really light and fluffy. I think this was the fluffiest chawanmushi I've ever had. It was also served with coriander - a first for me - giving a unique spin on this common dish.The bara chirashi used very fresh seafood, and didn't come with a lot of rice in comparison to the seafood used.We also had the grilled teriyaki beef, which was pretty good given the price, since really good cuts are pricey.A word of advice: some of the dishes are served with salad tossed with wasabi soy dressing.

OMG..!  The flavours were so amazingly balanced I sat there with my eyes closed enjoying the experience.  At some point it occurred to me they might think I was on drugs or something.. lolAs someone who loves to cook and travels extensively I've been lucky enough to eat in many top restaurants, including the ""elite"" where you book over a month in advance and spend exorbitant amounts of money.  I also love eating local and experiencing genuine cooking from people who care about what they do.  This meal and the obvious passion and dedication by the chefs and staff is beyond anything I've experienced.After a lot of internal deliberation I ordered the crispy pork belly and sat back and enjoyed watching the people enjoying finishing their meals and the symphony of staff behind the glass in the kitchen.My meal arrived and I'm lost for words, the skin was delicate and crisp, the pork itself needed no knife, the sauerkraut was incredible... subtle, delicate and not bitter.  Finally the potatoes... they had the most incredible texture, perfectly cooked at that point where they were done, but kept body and you could feel the variations in texture.  Honestly no words can describe the subtle perfectness of this meal.Without doubt this is the kind of meal and service that will earn a star and I couldn't be surprised to return and see a menu with prices 5 to 10 times the price.For now if you want to experience an incredible meal and prices that are unreasonably low you will not be disappointed.Unfortunately I fly out in a few days, but intend to eat here every day I can.   Can't wait to try Eugenia's menu."

You might want to review their reviews before mine (if they ever get around to writing them ;)). The ambiance of this place is spectacular. Dark, but not too dark. Classy but not over the top elegant. A definite romantic place for a date night. A special date night even since this place is so fancy. I'm not a big Southeast Asian foodie so this place wasn't really my style. The lunch set was not bad, but a bit too pricey for me at $30-50 per pax. Yadda, yadda, fancy restaurant, AC, and all, but was that food that much better than a hawker center? Probably not, my friend, which is exactly why I frown upon fine dining Singaporean food. Asian food in general actual (but I will be saving that note for another day). My notes from that meal saved on to my handy dandy Yelp app: The pork belly was okay but nothing special.The suckling pig was delicious! The crispy, crispy skin, which enhanced the flavor the succulent meat. YUM! Chicken curry and chicken and coconut! LOVED IT! I do still remember that suckling pig from 2 years ago (gosh! Can't believe it took me that long to finish writing this review!), which was probably one of the best I've tried in Singapore. I do also remember it being the most expensive suckling pig (read: small portions) when it was served. I guess it's all about quality and not quantity...With that said, this would be a good spot for Singaporeans to celebrate an anniversary, birthday, etc. I say Singaporean though I am not limiting this restaurant to only Singaporeans, but mainly bc I think it's a nice place for some upscale local dining. But for me, as an expat, I'll be at a hawker center or more causal restaurant to satisfy my local cravings."

The quail is well seasoned, juicy and still pink in the middle :). Had kaya tart with coconut ice cream for dessert. Best kaya tart I've had in a long time. Eugenia makes her own kaya. I think she should totally sell it in bulk. Same goes for her samba chili as well. This place has a pretty extensive menu and does a lot of seasonal events. Foodies should check it out."

Hence, the four-star rating. We came here for a prix fixe menu for my friend's birthday. The private room was nice and cosy, and the menu was pretty extensive for a 120 per pax dinner. The amuse bouche was forgettable, tasted like duck pate which is a tad too salty. The sea scallops with uni remolade was pretty good. The sea scallops were cooked a little too firm for my liking, but the flavor was good. The uni remolade tasted really great. Very rich though. The fillet of turbot was pretty good, although the sauce made the dish, not the fish which was bland. The consomme of foie gras ravioli was pretty good. The soup was a tad too salty though, and my ravioli disintegrated before it reached the table. Generally good flavor. My main was the uni linguine. If you didn't tell me it was uni, I would have guessed mullet roe. No distinct taste of uni, just a general seafoody taste. The noodles were over-cooked as well, so it was in all a disappointing dish. The dessert made up for the dinner though, which was an apple almond tart. It was light, warm, rich and delicious. The rest of the entrees had items such as coconut rice, chili tomato rice, oxtail rendang. Only for southeast asian fusion food lovers."

Was pretty empty on a Thursday night so we were able to choose the high chairs for our seat. As we were there for the first time, I wasn't really sure on where to order and asked one of the staffs about it. She directed us to the front where you can see the computer.Before making payments, what looked good to me was the Lemongrass Galangal Seafood Risotto. And of course, Milo Godzilla pudding for the dessert. My friends ordered the brunch platter for 2/3 pax and grilled barramundi fillet with holy basil almond pesto.Food came pretty earlier than what I expected. Mine came first and I started digging in without much hesitation. Was into risotto lately (hmmm).. My food has a strong aroma (which made me even hungrier than before) and the first bite, you can taste the different flavors bursting on your tongue. I love the touch of the ingredients especially the lemongrass condiments and the chilli inside the risotto. Overall, two thumbs up. The downside was that it was on the higher end and the portion wasn't big. Tried the brunch platter - it consist quite a variety (seen on the picture). I always crave for good fries and the fries have a crispy touch on it. I tried hashbrowns and the lemon dill fish fingers has fresh peach on it. The Crispy Chicken Tortilla was also good. All of them has perfect touch of condiments/sauces in them which made the taste last inside the mouth. The grilled barramundi filet wasn't that wow. For the Milo Godzilla pudding, I was searching for ""rare"" desserts and this one caught my eye straightaway even before my friend announced that she would like to order one portion too. Like a molten lava cake, it has ice cream on top (coconut flavored if I wasn't wrong) and chocolate cake at the bottom. The chocolate cake was moist. I am glad that we ordered just one dessert as we couldn't probably finish if we have more.Interior design wasn't too fancy. Open concept kitchen and open concept layout with some modern touches on its furnitures. Price like I mentioned, it is on the higher end but since it is located at one of the touristy places - Botanical Gardens, price range for me was al-right. Will be back for more in the future :)"

Had the pulled pork pasta - pork was a little too salty; wasn't spicy enough and slightly too oily : however it was okay Latte was Normal as well; so was the carbonara - nothing too memorable.

Was pretty empty on a Thursday night so we were able to choose the high chairs for our seat. As we were there for the first time, I wasn't really sure on where to order and asked one of the staffs about it. She directed us to the front where you can see the computer.Before making payments, what looked good to me was the Lemongrass Galangal Seafood Risotto. And of course, Milo Godzilla pudding for the dessert. My friends ordered the brunch platter for 2/3 pax and grilled barramundi fillet with holy basil almond pesto.Food came pretty earlier than what I expected. Mine came first and I started digging in without much hesitation. Was into risotto lately (hmmm).. My food has a strong aroma (which made me even hungrier than before) and the first bite, you can taste the different flavors bursting on your tongue. I love the touch of the ingredients especially the lemongrass condiments and the chilli inside the risotto. Overall, two thumbs up. The downside was that it was on the higher end and the portion wasn't big. Tried the brunch platter - it consist quite a variety (seen on the picture). I always crave for good fries and the fries have a crispy touch on it. I tried hashbrowns and the lemon dill fish fingers has fresh peach on it. The Crispy Chicken Tortilla was also good. All of them has perfect touch of condiments/sauces in them which made the taste last inside the mouth. The grilled barramundi filet wasn't that wow. For the Milo Godzilla pudding, I was searching for ""rare"" desserts and this one caught my eye straightaway even before my friend announced that she would like to order one portion too. Like a molten lava cake, it has ice cream on top (coconut flavored if I wasn't wrong) and chocolate cake at the bottom. The chocolate cake was moist. I am glad that we ordered just one dessert as we couldn't probably finish if we have more.Interior design wasn't too fancy. Open concept kitchen and open concept layout with some modern touches on its furnitures. Price like I mentioned, it is on the higher end but since it is located at one of the touristy places - Botanical Gardens, price range for me was al-right. Will be back for more in the future :)"

They were working on the AC indoors so it didn't bring us much relief from the heat (and exercise), but I hope it's done now!Exciting!They do the all-day brunch (as with their other branches), and my gal pal got the scrambled eggs with mushrooms & toast, and I went and ordered the Iced Earl Grey Tea with Milk (exhausted from the trek before). I had a nibble of her food (thank goodness for small appetites!) and found the scrambled eggs to be really fluffy and deliciouso, and the sautéed mushrooms to be the highlight - salty, bursting with flavour and juice, and uber fragrant! If you're getting the all-day brunch, I'd highly recommend the mushrooms.My drink however, was sub-par and disappointing, and with the $4.50 price tag, it was something I could have done at home - dunk a tea bag in hot tea and heavily dilute it with milk, then pour it on ice.

The atmosphere is quite nice as well, really green and casual with concrete floors, wooden tables and an open kitchen. On a Sunday afternoon expect to see many families with kids there, which makes for a loud, messy environment. I don't mind kids, I think they're really entertaining to watch, but I know some other reviewers complained that there were too many kids....The food was also very good! I've been getting a bit tired of hawker food, so I was willing to spend a little bit more to get a little taste of home. I ordered the grilled ham and cheese and roasted tomato salad, total was $13. The sandwich was served on ciabatta bread with greens and Dijon mustard vinigrette with sliced roasted ham and ooey goeey melty cheese (havarti, I think). I'm not sure if the sandwich was actually really good, or if I just missed bread and cheese so much that it didn't matter how good it was. I do think the sandwich could use more cheese- If I knew how little they would put I would have asked for extra, and been willing to pay for it. The roasted tomato salad was good, but not amazing. I was expecting grilled tomatoes on a plate seasoned with lemon and salt and pepper, but the dish was more like half of a sliced mushy tomato on a  bed of greens. It was okay, but I think the dish could use a better dressing and more tomatoes. Being the seasoned eater that I am I can frequently think of ways to make a dish better, but don't get me wrong, the food here is good.I think the cheapest item on the lunch menu is the chicken rendang S$ 9 and on the breakfast menu (served from 8:30-10:30?) is the mee rebus for S$ 5.One complaint I have is the people from the milkshake stand out front asked my friend and I three times if we wanted to buy a milkshake. The stand (some university partnership with FFT) is raising funds for children in Cambodia, which is a good cause and all, but I would have appreciated not being asked to buy a milkshake three times in a ten minute interval.If you're in the area definitely see the Botanic Gardens. Food For Thought makes a great reward for your long, sweaty walk though the gardens. :D"

Serves the typical array of American breakfast foods, from eggs & hash browns to pancakes, some with an extra flare. Two people in my group had the chocolate and raspberry pancakes, which were delicious! I also loved the hash browns I ordered (which were like American tater tots). The other food were tasty too. We came here for brunch so we didn't try a lot of the lunch menu items. The one I did try-- the ratatouille -- was mediocre. The ambiance was casual.They get docked some stars because of the ordering system which is a little confusing. You have to order and pay at the counter, and give them your table number so they can deliver it to the right table when the food comes. We had to make sure someone was sitting at the table so that it wasn't taken. It was also pretty crowded and busy so the service wasn't the fastest (although it's mostly self-service so you have to be pretty proactive about asking the wait staff for what you need). But, overall, we enjoyed our time here and I would recommend it as a nice breakfast or brunch place before (or after) a day out at the Botanic Gardens!"

Utensils, water etc are also to be taken by patrons themselves.Since this restaurant is much larger than the outlet at 8Q and the atmosphere is supposed to be a lot more casual and relaxing, this ""do-everything-at-your-own-pace"" system is pretty alright.

So the troop of us, about 6 managed to squeeze ourselves on to a single small table in an odd corner of the place. The menu is a replicate of the one found in the other branch at Queen St. Nonetheless, the space and ambience fortunately makes up for the lack of a waiting staff. I would imagine that need to hire a lot more if they were to get people seated by waiters, the dining space is sprawling, indoors and out. The food, I had the works. And a beer on the side. Yes, Sunday morning beers. Heh. We had to line up at a counter to place our orders and pay for them at the same time.

Even though it's pretty big, but it takes a while to get a table and then a little more to get your food. I prefer the sit down service at 8Q because at least i don't have to stand around to grab tables a la food court style. However, Botanic wins in terms of space and the close proximity to nature. Take your pick.Food is pretty much the same. Customize your own breakfast set with their creamy scrambled eggs (must order). FfT has one of the better scrambled eggs around because they actually use cream in theirs to give it that runny and buttery texture. I would say skip the Toasts unless you really need carbs. Their spreads are really pathetic though.What you should not miss out on is the pancakes. 2 Buttermilk base Pancakes served with Fresh Cream and Gula Melaka Syrup with the choice of different flavors such as Banana and Walnuts, Milk Chocolate, Dark Choc and Raspberries etc. Prices range from S$8 to $12."

Afterall, I was fond of its concept- a cause to support, breakfast components dissected to variable portions and trendy marketing: whats there not to love?Sad to say, I was disappointed both times when I went to visit. While the interior of the place is gorgeous (plants growing out of tables, mind you)- I found the ordering system counter-intuitive and user-unfriendly. The restaurant expects you to first find yourself a table, (have someone to) chope the seat, and queue at the ordering counter. When ordering, you are supposed to tell them exactly where you are seated (basically screwed if someone else takes your seat) or they will refuse to let you order until you have found an alternative seat. I can imagine what a hard time this would give single diners, or worse, having to split up lovey-eyed couples by forcing one to queue thereby subjecting them to a painful 20 minutes wait before they reunite! The 'choping' mechanism also makes me feel very ugly- I once had to tell someone with a crying baby on hand that basically all the seats around me were reserved. It is also very Singaporean, which surprises me, because Botanics is afterall a touristy place which attracts people whose culture might be vastly different from ours. I imagine this system to be completely indiscernible to them (I have seen foreigners bitch at staff over it).Even the food is not comparable to the other outlet. My scrambled eggs came too buttery, it was like drinking oil, but I didn't even feel like sending it back because it would possibly mean having to wait for another half an hour. The menu is also different from the other outlet's- so if you are thinking of heading to this one for a specific dish, remember to check the online menu before you make your trip down."

I've come back a handle of times for it since my mom first introduced it to me last November. It's a pretty small restaurant so would highly recommend making a reservation especially since they need to keep people further apart now for social distancing. The restaurant interior is quite cozy and a little dim during dinner however it's really nice to sit by the window at lunch time. I believe they also have some outdoor seats (but it's way too hot here). The food is so so good. We usually order the duck rilletes ($12.50/100g) and pork terrine ($18.50/100g)  which are both quite good although I prefer the duck more. Served with some cornichons. I also don't have a picture but there is this seasonal cheese (?!) from November to March I think that is so amazing. It's like a melted Brie and comes with toasted crackers to dip in. Honestly such a disappointment that it's not available all the time because I'm obsessed with it. Didn't know cheese could be seasonal. And again the cote de boeuf ($158) is my favourite. It's always cooked perfectly and the caramelised onion and cooked down garlic go perfectly.

Expensive, so the misses hurt.I've been twice, the first time for an onglet and a sage and rabbit stew, the second for a herring salad and a hazelnut souffle, both times upstairs. The room is dark, loud music plays (too loud), and a TV is displaying some old French food related shows from a time when countryside food still existed (think Aile ou la Cuisse). Caught a nice recipe for chestnut and foie gras soup. The tables are made of planks, and the seats not that comfortable for extended conversations. Oh well, I didn't come here for the ambience. The onglet was great, flavourful, cooked properly and with a nice shallot sauce. Great fries too in a massive portion. And it better be at $32, which at l'Entrecote also gets you a salad and bread. The rabbit stew however lacked flavour - just a creamy, slightly unsalted sauce with sage floating on top. The herring salad was, again, average. Not much herring, although it was alright as far as herrings go, and some pickled onions and carrots with a puddle of oil underneath. This time, at $19, I expected more. The souffle was the biggest disappointment. Just look at the photo. A souffle is all about texture. If I wanted hazelnut cream, I'd have ordered it. There was no texture to this souffle although it looked so good on the outside which amplified the disappointment. The chocolate ice cream was particularly creamy and not very cocoa rich, which was too much when faced with a bowl of hazelnut cream - it was left behind. At $25 for that, well, if you sell your expertise in cuisine de famille or cuisine bourgeoise the execution is pretty damn important. As a French national who has eaten many a souffle, be it cheese, raspberry or Grand Marnier, I did not recognize that bowl as belonging to that family.The menu is short enough that all items ought to be done properly, especially at that price point. I gave it a second go because of the onglet the first time, but I will stick with Bistro du Vin from now on, where execution is exactly the same every time, as befits a French kitchen."

I was disappointed to learn that indoor seating wasn't available (at 8.30pm at night). The place was tiny!!! less than 5 tables indoors. Thankfully, Singapore's humidity was kind to us that night. Although sitting by the road, near a cow grass patch wasn't exactly the ambiance I had in mind when dining at a French restaurant...The food1. Salmon rilette - Love! They have a Rillette (and Charcuterie) Bar, which sells rillettes and cold cuts by weight. Beautifully fresh. Came with baguette and pickles on the side. Love the presentation. 2. Frogs legs - Pan-fried frog's legs, fried with garlic and butter and some herbs, was not bad. At times a little fishy but overall the garlic/herbs did a good job in masking  the fishy taste. 3. Cote de Boeuf (1kg) - $138 - sautéed onions and sauce.  Good. Only very fatty. You probably have to spend some time cutting the fats out. It didn't help that we were seated outside in the dark with nothing more than a candlelight to help us see what we were bitting into. Portion - Very huge. 4 of us could barely finish it. 4. Pastries - We had 2. One with Cheese & Ham (I liked) and the other with Mixed meat (I didn't quite liked it. It was too salty). Too bad we didn't have space for desserts :( The serviceGood. Although there was only 1 waiter for the outdoor tables. I think he had to manage 10-15 tables...not to mention lugging around their huge standing-2meter-board which served as the speciality menu. If he was tired, it definitely didn't show. Kudos to putting up with so many diners all in one night. Overall, not bad. I would come back again if I could get a table indoor and probably order more  rilette & have a go at their desserts :)"

You can order food and drinks here and enjoy the good wine selection. After eating an appetizer up here we got out table downstairs in the restaurant area.  Overall I'd say the food was fairly good. I cant say to be an expert in French cuisine so some of the items were new to me.  To be honest I tend to gravitate towards spicy food so the flavor seemed a bit more subtle to me.  The duck rillette was very good.  I enjoyed the beef with a red wine sauce but I was thinking it would be more of a steak but was actually more like a stew. The meat was very tender and fell apart.  We also had a quail salad. The quail was very tasty and well done. The wine we had was good as well.  The ambiance is relaxed and friendly.

We were seated outside and it was a hot, humid day. You can imagine how unpleasantness the whole dining experience was. The food was good, but perhaps because we were bathed in sweat, this restaurant has always slipped our minds.Fast forward for a few years, and we suddenly were reminded of this place again. We Google-ed it up and found out that it has moved to a new location. But thankfully, the food quality remains the same.We had quail salad and some bacon seafood salad for starters. To be honest, they were not particularly memorable. And I'm not a big fan of salad either, so I couldn't care less.The main courses were the belle of the ball. We ordered a sweetbread-stuffed veal trotter and it was as good as it sounds. The jelly-like skin (very similar to pork's) and the sweetbread were just a perfect combination for a guilty pleasure. We also ordered the 40-clove garlic chicken. I'm a garlic guy and I thoroughly enjoyed that dish. The garlic just penetrates through the chicken meat. Beef tongue were a specialty of the day, and we also chowed through it. All of the main dishes had a very strong home-cooked feel to it, that heartiness as if your French grandma had cooked them herself. It was fantastic.For dessert, we had the coconut souffle and some alcohol-marinated cherry + ice cream. The souffle was perfectly cooked and it was our first time having a coconut souffle. They proved to be a good match.All in all, I really enjoyed the dinner here. It's something I probably won't visit too often, considering how guilty the meals were, but should I decide to commit another food sin, this place will be on the top of my list."

Le Bistro offers great food. My favourite is the beef cheek. I've tried a few other things, most of which were delicious. I wish the next empty space next door hadn't been converted into a construction site, which has taken away the pleasant outdoor seating area. But that's entirely not the restaurant's fault. When there is a big dinner party inside the dining room, it can get a tad loud and you may have to shout across the table at your dining companion, though the food mostly makes up for the slight inconvenience."

The beef onglet wasn't the best cut of meat but it was cooked exactly as ordered and the garlic confit on top was delicious. The pommel frites went down a treat too. Service was patchy and as a result we never ordered desserts as we were never shown a dessert menu (despite having our table cleared and sitting there with empty glasses....).

THE FOOD:  We each chose different starters and were all happy.  As I am no expert on French cuisine and because it was too dark to note the plates - I can only say that we all cleaned our plates.  I don't recall the name of my starter - it was a stacked brie, ham and pastry dish that had the flavors of a gourmet ham & cheese croissant - it was quite good!   For the mains, 4 of us shared two portions of the Cote de Boeuf. This was EXCEPTIONAL!  (The lengthy wait for the mains was definitely because of the prep time for these very large portions of beef.)  Two of us shared one, but it was enough for at least 3 or 4 people.  The beef was tender, flavorful and served along side a large portion of sauteed onions and garlic cloves.  OUTSTANDING!!  My only complaint is that is was quite fatty, and in the darkness it was difficult to separate out the fat.  The side of gratin potatoes were creamy, rich and delicious.  The 2 bottles of french red wine were good.  In the heat of the night, they did a great job at keeping the water glasses filled.  The total bill was $720  / $144 each (5 starters, 2 Cote de Boeuf ($138 each), a Duck entree, 2 bottles of wine).The Good:  The food! - especially the Cote de Boeuf (4-5 stars) The Bad:  The alfresco dining (1 star)The Verdict:  All of us look forward to another visit - but only at an inside table. Lesson learned."

THE FOOD:  We each chose different starters and were all happy.  As I am no expert on French cuisine and because it was too dark to note the plates - I can only say that we all cleaned our plates.  I don't recall the name of my starter - it was a stacked brie, ham and pastry dish that had the flavors of a gourmet ham & cheese croissant - it was quite good!   For the mains, 4 of us shared two portions of the Cote de Boeuf. This was EXCEPTIONAL!  (The lengthy wait for the mains was definitely because of the prep time for these very large portions of beef.)  Two of us shared one, but it was enough for at least 3 or 4 people.  The beef was tender, flavorful and served along side a large portion of sauteed onions and garlic cloves.  OUTSTANDING!!  My only complaint is that is was quite fatty, and in the darkness it was difficult to separate out the fat.  The side of gratin potatoes were creamy, rich and delicious.  The 2 bottles of french red wine were good.  In the heat of the night, they did a great job at keeping the water glasses filled.  The total bill was $720  / $144 each (5 starters, 2 Cote de Boeuf ($138 each), a Duck entree, 2 bottles of wine).The Good:  The food! - especially the Cote de Boeuf (4-5 stars) The Bad:  The alfresco dining (1 star)The Verdict:  All of us look forward to another visit - but only at an inside table. Lesson learned."

I was so impressed the first time around--super thin, crisp pizzas with unconventional, fresh toppings! It was always such a treat.I must say, however, that I think the pizza menu has gone down. They slowly removed all my favorites from the menu. The one with butternut squash or the one with figs is no longer available, so the only pizza that I still like is the turkey with blueberry compote. Not everyone is a fan of turkey though, so it's not a winning order.Because of the lack in good pizza selections, we tried the salads and pastas--they did not disappoint. Hence, the 4 stars still. The seafood aglio olio was delicious and the roasted veggies salad was pretty good too. The cakes sounded really good too, but we didn't get a chance to try any.With that being said, I would probably only go back to Skinny Pizza for items other than the pizza... Ironic. Bring back the old pizza flavors!!!"

The servers got confused by our indecisiveness as we walked here and then walked out of this chain and back again afterwards. Since it wasn't crowded on a Saturday afternoon, we sat ourselves on our preferred table.Ordered Bacon Aglio Olio, English Breakfast Pizza (reminds me of the truffle pizza at Spizza-Balmoral) and Spicy Mango-tea-ni for beverage. Didn't order a truffle fries as I didn't really like the one in Raffles City Shopping Center. Was al-right only and wasn't the best bet. Food came awhile later. Wasn't too long of a wait. But two of us were like zombies as we didn't have much sleep the day before and still dazed out at the time we entered the open concept dining area.Aglio Olio was decent. Wasn't a wow for me and is higher on its pricing. Could probably go to another place for a better one. The English Breakfast Pizza was quite good too just that they had given us too much vegetables and tomatoes. The pizza was crisp on its outer layer. Was quite good but once again it come in too pricy for a normal sized pizza. Taste and ingredients wise was alright. At the end of our meal, I requested the bill and one of the waitress gave me a survey form to fill up. It is in a form of bookmark. There were two questions - what is well done and what need fixing. Was also given a free cocktail on my next visit which last 1 year and 1 month. If you turn the face at the back of the voucher you can see a smiley or frowny face. While my friend and I walked out of the store, the servers bowed down their heads and thanked us. Why there's a minus one here is due to the pricing and it had too much vegetable in the pizza. Otherwise, it's good. Will try other foods there in the future."

Great for people like me who ain't big fans of pizza doughs. We ordered the squid ink pizza which was fabulous. The English Breakfast pizza was not that great though.There were five of us and we woof down the two pizza really quickly.

Squid ink pizza  - Da best! Crispy pizza base with fresh squid toppings. Instead of the usual thick tomato based pizza sauce, Skinny uses a nice savory-sweet sauce (mayo? unsure but it sure taste awesome). 2. Chicken sausage (spicy) - Not bad. I am not much of a sausage fan. 3. Corn (with cream cheese) - Some parts of the corn was under cooked, making it though to bite. The corn was dry and not as juicy. However, the cream cheese topping was great :) who knew cream-cheese went well with corn? 4. Sweet potato nibblets - Pass on this dish! it was disappointing. The wedges are too thick and dry. The fries turned soggy after awhile. Definitely do not expect american style sweet potato fries. Skinny has much to learn from the yankies. Overall: Will come back for the pizza again. Nothing else excites me much."

This was my second time eating at Skinny Pizza and it was incited by seeing so much foodporn regarding this place on food blogs as well as instagram.Knowing that the pizza was quite a big serving for just one person alone, my 2 friends and I decided to order 2 pizzas as well as the truffle fries to share amongst us and it was indeed a good decision on our part. We ordered Skinny Pizza's specialty- Squid Ink pizza. The pizza could definitely do with slightly more sauce to make it more flavorful as well as to reduce the dryness of the pizza. Nonetheless, the squid on the pizza did help to save the pizza's reputation.We also ordered the English Breakfast pizza which looks like the second most appetizing pizza on the menu. This pizza was pretty good. The tomatoes on this pizza was really huge, juicy and tasty and weirdly enough, it was the highlight of this pizza for me. The truffle fries didn't particularly suit my taste buds, perhaps it may be because I was not used to not having my fries taste salty instead of bitter. The fries reminded me of wasabi fries and for $7, I don't think its worth it as I ended up drowning the taste in chilli sauce.The bill surmounted to $66 which means we spent $22 per person. The cakes at Skinny Pizza looked really sumptuous however, by then we were already too full for dessert. The pasta also seemed scrumptious but while looking around, it did not seem to be a popular choice amongst customers.On a side note, the service at this outlet is highly commendable. The staff crew was very enthusiastic and polite, constantly asking us if we would like a refill and everyone of them also bidded my friends and I goodbye when we exited the shop."

But one weekday night I decided to give it a go. They offer western comfort food, like greasy burgers, artery clogging mac and cheese, chili cheese fries, milk shakes etc.They also offer customization of burgers, so you get to pick your veg, meat, egg, sauces and even buns. You could pretty much create a mega upsized burger with all forms of protein and dairy products, as long as your wallet was okay with it.Most burgers are priced around $13-$18++, you can top up $2.50++ for truffle Parmesan fries or chili cheese fries. Just top up and you won't regret it. Totally worth the extra time in the gym and money!So here was our feast for 3 pax, 2 hungry adult males and I! It was way too much food. I could sense food coma approaching as I looked at the table!1. Shrooms Burger $13++ + $2.50 for chili cheese frieslove mushrooms and the mushrooms here were quite generous. The burger bun was fluffy and slighly crispy on the edges, but as time went by, it became a soggy burger bun. The onions weren't very flavourful but rather, they were quite oily. Nonetheless, the onions brought out the flavour of the juicy mushrooms.I loved the melted cheese. It was perfect for the thick beef patty. I really liked this combination and for the price. I felt that it was pretty decent. The chili fries weren't as good as I had remembered. But the fries were crisp all the way.2. DIY Burger + $2.50 for truffle friesAt Fay Boys you get to customize your burger. For this baby, we haveHoney Oat bun $2 with1. Beef Patty $92. Bacon $2.503. Sauteed Shitake Mushroom $24. Swiss Cheese $1.805. Fried Egg $1.506. Fried Onion Rings $1.507. Garlic Aioli $0.80Total $21.10++It is a pretty pricey burger but it has everything that I want on a burger, no veggies! The burger came pretty quickly and sadly I didn't get the honour of bursting the runny egg yolk. The garlic aioli sauce was addictive and it really gave everything in the burger the same flavour.3. Chicken waffle sandwich $15.50++Another sinful main course, chicken cutlet sandwiched between cheese underneath a buttermilk waffle. The chicken cutlet was pretty thin despite it's length, but it was crispy and breaded. The waffle was quite tasteless despite it's colour. The mash potatoes were strangely cold but tasty.4. Onion RingsI loved these onion rings mainly due to the batter they used. It was fragrant and very crispy. It wasn't doughy at all. The onion rings were huge in diameter and they tasted great with the bbq sauce.5. CalamariThe calamari was abit too chewy for my liking. But the wasabi mayo was it's saving grace. Definitely preferred the onion rings over the calamari.Overall : Decent burgers with quick and friendly service. Just skip the sides."

The show of skills alone was already impressive, watching him slice up the meat and vegetables so quickly yet precisely. The most important thing was the fact that he could control the timing and heat of it, so that the met retained its flavour and juiciness. Each piece of beef was equally tender and juicy, bursting with flavour but not too salty. The sauce was delicious when mixed with the bowl of Japanese rice we were served with. The tofu that came with the set was also worthy of praise, with the silky texture and thick savoury sauce. Service was also excellent as it should be, seeing that they only had one table to attend to.  The chef also made it a point to make small talk when he was preparing the food, which I felt was a nice touch. Otherwise it could get a tad uncomfortable if we were simply sitting in silence watching him carry out his task, or totally ignoring his presence and talking among ourselves."

I would never go or ask anyone to go to a character themed cafe. One has to preorder the meals and each meal cost $29.90 (all inclusive include tax and service charge). This is going to be one expensive lunch and of cos the two adults did not expect much from the food. When we arrived at the cafe, it was not opened. My brother was surprised cos he even came here personally a couple of days ago and made the payment. He walked over to another store which probably are related and the girl quickly went to open the cafe.The staff showed us to our table. The cafe is tiny, very tiny. I am glad I don't weigh 300 lbs. There are cute plushies everywhere. It is 100% kawaii!!She also turned on this humongous tv which probably is over 70"" and it started playing Kungfu Panda 3. We looked around and snapped some pictures. The staff asked if we would like to have our lunch served and we said sure. I was a little puzzled; were we supposed to play with the plushies and when hungry, asked for our food? Note: the female staff was extremely friendly and nice. The kind who I probably can go sbux with.After a very very long time, the food came. The stew or soup was nice with generous chunks of potatoes and carrots. The gyozas tasted like chinese dumplings in dim sum places. The meal also came with a beverage and a snack.The meal definitely not worth the $29.90 each pax but hey at least there was the Rila Kuji ticket which was a sure win ""scratch & win"" ticket."

It would have been more if our kind server hadn't informed us that we may be ordering too much food lol. We did want some assortment. The seafood was some of the best I have ever had. This is incredible and worth mentioning considering I think Singapore has to import some, if not most of it. Lol. It was expensive but it was also a lot of delicious food.

The calamari, also fresh, was bland as well. The corn could have been cooked a little longer it was on the hard side. I had high hopes for this place being that it was packed but for $39SGD it should have been better.

And it's marked vegetarian but comes with shrimp in the broth. So go figure.* Fried Sesame Balls with Liqueur and Red Bean Paste - pretty damn tasty, but not particularly unique. About as good as good sesame balls I've had anywhere else. But it was definitely decent.Overall I'd say there are probably better places for the price, so do yourself a favor and go find them."

I had a chicken bowl and the portion was HUGE. There is a salsa bar to jazz up your food (even though none of it is too spicy) and my very picky children loved the queso. They have very refined queso pallets. They consider themselves experts!The service was fast and the staff was friendly. They also had a deal where if you checked in on FaceBook, you got a free order of cinnamon churros! They staff was so kind to bring two orders (one for each of my children).

Every set comes with a serve of nachos, and free flow servings of freshly made salsa and salsa sauces. I always go nuts on the fresh salsa.

Because it would be a cold day in hell (theres a joke in there about Singapore's weather somewhere) before I'd pay that much for a burrito, I spent a good amount of time on the hunt.After many sweaty treks through the city searching for a burrito, I happened to pass Baja Fresh one day on the way home. My prayers had been answered! While not 'the best thing I've ever had', Baja Fresh definitely hit the spot and fulfilled my craving. It's a shame that there's not more places where you can get a grab-n-go burrito (for a city that prides itself on eating, this is even more surprising). Alas, if you're like me, an American craving some south of the border fare, Baja Fresh will suffice."

So you place your order at the counter and will be given a number, after which a wait staff will pass you the food.We were so confused when we first tried to order too! Everything is new to us, and there are not many pictures we can use as reference on the menu. The counter staff was really helpful though - she patiently explained each food to us and made recommendations.Really enjoyed the taco chips they gave as appetizers as well which you can dip into 5 types of salsa. Very fun!Our food was also very good. It was fresh! I never thought mexican food to be like that to be honest.

You can tell that the salsa is old and the cheese has been sitting in a packet for I don't know how long.This outlet overprices horrendously, charging $12 for a simple burrito that isn't even big enough for a proper meal. I could get double the quantity at Cha Cha Cha in Holland Village for the same price (with better ambiance).Even worse, this chain does not provide free water! When I went there, I took the spicy sauce and needed water but they flat out refused to give me tap water! They forced me to buy a bottle of water for $2.00 instead while my mouth was on fire. For a restaurant whose prices are so high, at least Baja Fresh could be classy enough to give free water, but I guess not. Furthermore, the staff is incredibly rude and hostile. I did not get a good vibe from either cashier whatsoever - they are cold and didn't even say ""hello"" back when I greeted them before ordering. Definitely put a bad taste in my mouth before the old pico de gallo had the chance.The only thing saving this place from a 1-star rating is the free nachos with every meal. I am surprised that a place as cheap as Baja Fresh (no free tap water!?!?) would provide this, but to be fair, there are only 5 or 6 nachos in the tiny bowl anyway. Still, I appreciate the thought. I have not been back to Baja Fresh since the first time and I do not recommend anyone who perhaps would like a drink of water after a spicy meal without paying $2.00 for a bottle of water, which not only is unnecessary spending but also harms the environment by promoting water bottles.

Just to note. This Ippudo is no longer called Ippudo x Tao, but now is just ""Ippudo Mohamed Sultan"". Regardless of the name, the food was tremendous.Starting with some aioli potatoes and the pork/shrimp buns, these dishes warmed up the appetite for the forthcoming ramen. Potatoes were soft, but still had some bit to them, so they were not like mashed potatoes; and had really good seasoning. The buns were just as I remember them from New York, except now I was able to enjoy them outside with a cold beer as well. And then there was the ramen. The Hakata Shoyu Special came with pork belly, egg, and seaweed. The broth was hot and flavorful. It was a bit stronger than the New York bowl, but finished a lot more smoothly (strange to be speaking about ramen broth like a whisky or wine - but it was that good). The pork was cooked perfect and added a nice bit of fat to the broth. I could not slurp down the ramen fast enough. If you're a fan of Ippudo, or just ramen in general, this should not be skipped."

We started with two drinks from their menu: the Cassis Soda (black current liquor with soda and lime) and the Sunshine (cassis with gin and orange juice). They were a bit sweet, but very refreshing and helped with the warmth of the patio seat.We split a number of smaller plates rather than ordering main entrees. They included the potato salad, broccoli, chef's choice veggie skewers, scallops, salmon aburi roll, unagi roll (grilled eel, cucumber and egg, wrapped in a seaweed rice roll covered with flying fish roe), and crab frits. All were delicious and the crab frits were a tasty first for me. I was a fan of the fact that we could eat tapas-style Japanese and thought the food was unique and presented very well.

So I decided to call Ippudo Tao and I was so happy when they said they do take reservations!! So off we went to finally have Ramen :-)I was pleasantly surprised and liked the place a lot. We were seated outside and it was so quiet and relaxing. The staff was really nice and very helpful on the food recommendation. They even ask you how you want your noodles cooked which I found wonderful!! I hate Ramen with soft overcooked noodles...I ordered the Bonito Tonkotsu Special and it is one of the yummiest Ramen i've had in Singapore!

The overall taste was similar to what I had in Japan, which is probably a compliment of the highest order: the chewiness of the noodles, the tenderness of the pork slices and the richness of the broth was just right. The egg (""tamago""), which is usually the make-or-break factor for me, did not disappoint: its yolk was deliciously runny, giving the near-perfect bowl of ramen its extra oomph.

I seeked the King of Curry, CoCo Ichibanya when I was in Singapore, I figure it'd be a cheaper option than to fly to Japan and try it there (hahaha).CoCo Ichibanya was decorated with cute murals on the wall and the menu was very extensive. For starters, you can reduce the amount of rice you want in the serving and add any toppings into the curry. Not only that, they also offer five different level of spiciness for the curry sauce.Hubby was tempted to try the extremely hot one and after much thought he decided on it. Hubby ordered extra fried chicken as an additional topping for his beef curry. I wasn't feeling well at that time but I figured spicy curry could cure my blocked nose so I ordered mine with level 3 and sweet corn topping.I reduced the rice for my beef curry which turned out to be perfect. Hubby was really full after eating his curry and questioned his judgment on why he ordered the extra topping. CoCo Ichibanya wasn't cheap if you considered the cost of extra topping or drinks, but the restaurant was definitely perfect for a family outing and quick lunch or dinner.We spotted a guy who ordered his curry with the extremely hot level and he had trouble finishing it. He was sweating bullets but of course a guy had to look strong especially when surrounded by two pretty girls that he shared his table with. We went out of the restaurant while eyeing him through the corner of our eyes. I think it boosted Hubby's confidence because he finished his curry without any problems at all (*evil smirk*)."

The order takes about 10-15 minutes to come, which is pretty decent. The food comes piping hot! So be careful when you take your first bite. I had the chicken katsu curry the first time I came with standard rice and level 1 hotness. Level 1 is the right amount of spicy for me, no more no less. The second time I got the pork tonkatsu omelette curry. I recommend the pork rather than the chicken. There's a lot of fat(?) for the chicken and the size of the chicken is very small.

There's something about Thai food that captivates everyone. Whether it's the over the top, burn your mouth off chilli or that combination of flavours that evokes all your senses at once, Thai food never fails to warm your heart and make you crave for more. Being a regular at Holland Village, we've seen the super long queues for Nakhon Kitchen and it's always made us wonder just how good the food is. We finally had the chance to try when, amazingly, there were less than 10 people in the queue. Waiting time was around 15 mins considering that most people had wanted to sit indoors instead of outside in the sweltering hit. Having a few favourite thai joints, we had to try some of our favourites. Tom Ka Chicken Soup ($6) Unlike most people who go on the search for the best Tom Yum soup, I love my Tom Ka. I love myself a god Tom yum but Tom Ka elevates that sour tanginess with the rich, smooth, sweetness of the coconut milk. There's was a good portion of chicken and mushroom and while it offered that tangy kick, it was a little light on the coconut milk. While it gave it that milky colour, the sweetness and richness of the coconut milk didn't shine through as much. Pineapple Curry with Mussels ($8)The one thing I admire about thai curries is their ability to use fresh fruits into their curry, adding that extra level of sweetness to compliment to spiciness and sourness. The curry here was pretty nice, thicker than I expected but really spicy and Because of that spiciness, it didn't really do much for the mussels. While the mussels were large and fresh, they didn't add a lot of flavour into the curry and vice versa. Maybe because there were only 5 mussels. Ironically, when I took the dish home, added in some coconut milk and cooked it with fish, it turned out to be a very good fish curry. Stir fried Kai Lan with mushrooms ($6)Kai Lan was not overcooked, which was nice. Mushroom, sliced, were juicy but the overall dish was just a bit too salty for me. I love the use of thai oyster sauce in vegetables, I use it a lot too in mine but this was just too heavy on the sauce. Thai Iced Tea ($3)This had to be the biggest let down for me. At $3, it was probably the most diluted or weak thai iced tea I've had. Overall, the food was decent but at the prices, I could see why they were so popular. Unfortunately for me, it really felt like the crowds were there more for the price than for how good the food actually is. For me, I'd still rather pay a little more and stick to my favourite Thai restaurants."

The prawn were fresh, and the curry is rich with a nice aroma of coconut, basil, and the long beans and fig were crunchy. The stir fried asparagus is a surprise, a good balance of garlic brought out the sweetness of the asparagus, the carrots is probably there to add color, but the prawns here is probably frozen thawed type. Pandan leaf chicken is a biggest pleasant surprise of all, very tender like otah, chicken chunks soft. A definite repeat order.Tom yum is well prepared. Good balance of spicy and sour, and seafood prawn and squid is fresh, I don't normally order Tom yum on my own, but this dish is good enough for me to try.I would not order the pineapple rice next time round.

Very nice.Ordered Tom Yam soup, $6 and my favorite Phad Thai $5. The restaurant was half full 2 minutes after opening. Food arrived pretty quickly. Dug into Phad Thai and the soup. My heart sank. Why is it so sweet? The Phad Thai appeared to have a big bunch of sugar in it. Like wise for the soup. I have made both dishes at home and it can taste good without the sugar load. I looked around me and I can see patrons tucking enthusiastically into the sugar bin. For the easy on the pocket prices, I can see why it's so popular.Came here a second time and was hoping it will be better. The green curry chicken is horrible. It's frozen chicken and paste at best."

Quickly i ended my order before i could do anything else stupid like ordering an additional side of churros with chocolate dip. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes and i was happy to find that they offer chipotle medium hot sauce at the condiment table; there were also sliced Jalapeño and diced red onion plus 2 other kind of sauces. It was a good 30 minutes before i could eat and the bowl stayed pretty warm in the eco friendly to-go container. Another nice touch was the melted cheese on the rice but the real saving grace was the hot sauce I picked up on the way out. the sauce really gave the other wise regular tasting bowl its kick. if you like black beans then you will be happy to know they are very generous with their beans. i ran out of rice faster than i could eat the beans.

I chose the spicy grilled steak with regular rice and a side of gucamole. she asked if i wanted sour cream. not being too keen about it, i replied, ""just a little."" she said, ""sorry, we don't do just a little...it's additional 50 cents."" that's when the first wave of missing Chipotle came crashing over me. i already accepted the fact I had to pay additional $2 for my guac and also they don't have corn as an ingredient in the bowl so I didn't think I want to splurge anymore for my $13 meal. Quickly i ended my order before i could do anything else stupid like ordering an additional side of churros with chocolate dip. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes and i was happy to find that they offer chipotle medium hot sauce at the condiment table; there were also sliced Jalapeño and diced red onion plus 2 other kind of sauces. It was a good 30 minutes before i could eat and the bowl stayed pretty warm in the eco friendly to-go container. Another nice touch was the melted cheese on the rice but the real saving grace was the hot sauce I picked up on the way out. the sauce really gave the other wise regular tasting bowl its kick. if you like black beans then you will be happy to know they are very generous with their beans. i ran out of rice faster than i could eat the beans. By now i am completely missing Chipotle like crazy.Thanks Guzman and Gomez for offering me a decent bowl of mexican food. it doesn't completely satisfy me but I am glad you are in my life for now."

This outlet (obviously) serves the same stuff, but the quality really differs. The fried prawn wrapped in bean curd skin used to be much better with the beancurd skin distinctly seen and tasted. In comparison, the dish now almost fails to differentiate itself from prawns fried in dough. The chicken feet in bean sauce also failed to pack a punch, leaving a somewhat unfresh taste in the mouth. The fried yam balls were oily and did not impress with it's mediocre filling, unlike it's previously fragrant ones. The fried bqq pork buns looked similar to that of Tim Ho Wan's, but failed at first bite when it was not crispy. The congee also tasted rather bland, like plain congee cooked separately from the ingredients, rather than their previously flavourful congees. The har gau (prawn dumpling) and siew Mai were average. Notjong impressive, but I wouldn't mind dropping by if I'm nearby especially on a weekday where there's 50% off!"

It really is good and worth your time and effort.  The hoary exterior of this creature is a rapidly crumbling crust that melts away to reveal the light and almost barely imperceptible skin of gossamer dough, just enough of a physical presence to structurally contain the sweet, savoury offering of fatty char siew, flavoured just this side of heavenly and a hair shy of naughty, the sauce redolent of pork fat.  It's good and it shows because they always run quick and early.The roast meats are nothing short of mediocre. Very uninteresting. In my very humble opinion, I had a much better roast duck and roast pork at the Grand Park City Hall Chinese restaurant, Park Palace.  The Pork Belly Char Siew looked so promising and I've included a photo to prove it.  The meat was resistant and the fat had not been rendered, which left it rubbery.  The sauce was nice enough, but not enough to hide the fact that this nice hunk of pork had been ruined.  Shame.My default place for a respectable utility Cantonese meal remains Crystal Jade.  For a good quality meal no place beats Hua Ting.Canton Paradise is just a-ok.  It really is."

The prices are a little on the high side, but hey, they are a restaurant afterall.The food is above average on the whole but I must say the highlight for me was the braised beef noodles. The beef was tender and the tendon managed to get the flavors from the sauce nicely. The noodles was pretty QQ (bouncy) and chewy which is good.

Beats me as I have never seen anything like this before but this is also one of the popular dishes ordered by patrons who walked pass me. The fried and boiled wantons were placed together on the plate as the stall had ran out of soup. Instead of tossing the noodles with the usual sauces, they were replaced by tomato with common wantons mee ingredients like char siew and vegetables. Talking about that, beside having noodles already processed with tomato flavours, the sauce comes with the real tomato. The noodles, as a whole were a little dry and too tangy for my liking, also I find them quite salty.Tomato Noodle Wanton Mee - $4.50Since Timbre+ is still in its novelty stage and with news media advertising, the crowd coming in was literally non-stop.

This was my first time to the Holland Village area and it seemed to be buzzing, in general, and this restaurant was no different. There are tons of restaurants to choose from in the area but I was dying for Mexican food, and this seemed like the only spot in the area. The restaurant is like most others in the little thoroughfare in that it is completely open to the street. We were seated rather quickly and handed menus. The menu contains all of the tex-mex staples I was hoping for, including nachos, burritos, fajitas, and enchiladas. I ended up ordering a chimichanga and we got the chicken nachos for a starter. We also ordered a couple of jumbo margaritas. The nachos came out first and they were pleasant enough but pretty plain. They were just tortilla chips with melted cheese, shredded chicken and a few pickled jalapenos thrown on top. Then we got our margaritas, which had a really peculiar texture. I'm used to frozen margaritas having a slushy texture but these were rather thick and smoothie-like. They were really sweet and didn't have much of a tequila kick to them, unfortunately. Our mains came out and my partner and I exchanged surprised looks. I guess I'm used to TexMex places including rice and beans with the entrees automatically, but these mains were simply the dish itself... which we didn't expect. My plate had a card deck-sized chimichanga on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce-that's it. The chimichanga was alright- definitely freshly cooked but woefully understuffed and underseasoned. There was barely any meat inside (mostly cheese and beans). It was pretty poor value for the price, honestly. With the nachos, it was enough food but after spending $100+, I would have expected a more satisfying meal. Service was pretty scant after we were seated. It took us a while to get our orders in. Though to be fair it seemed like the restaurant was definitely understaffed for how busy it was."

Service was pretty friendly, quite prompt, and the food was above expectations. The guacamole with corn chips was alright. It wasn't a bad guac by any means, and it was definitely a generous serving of chips, but definitely not amazing memorable wow.My main though was wow. The fluetas (not sure if i spelled that right), which is a deep fried flour wrap stuffed with your choice of meat (I chose shredded chicken) and then served topped with sour cream, more guac, and cheese. Wow. Crispy, flavourful, and surprisingly filling, I was stuck with a craving for more the day after just based on the memory of it.My date ordered the combo, which comes with a three items (I honestly forgot what the three items were... there was a taco (soft or hard, your choice), maybe a tortilla, and something else) but it was good. Generously sized, and served with refried beans. I love refried beans, and theirs tasted as beans generally do (I've never tried Mexican or Tex-mex overseas, so I can't tell if it's how they SHOULD taste...) and overall I felt it was good value considering the price.They also let us linger and talk for quite a while, we were the last to leave and they never tried to chase us off or even hinted that we should leave. I love it when a restaurant's okay with that, and after a while we realised we were the last patrons and left with guilty grins. It's a good place.

As for the entrees, I must commend the chef for whipping up such a potent and delicious bowl of Chilli con Carne. The jalapeno peppers packed a real punch!

OK, so maybe we're in Singapore so being on the opposite side of the world I need to adjust my expectations, but I'm a man of principle. The food is passable not nothing special (hence the A-OK rating). The sauces in the fajitas or burritos aren't especially tasty, the chips are ""meh"", and the guac is so-so. And it's expensive to boot (well, for Singapore I guess it's average, but I'm used to cheap Mexican food). Service is a bit slow, but the location is nice enough that you can just hang out with some friends and chatting over some drinks while people watching. If you're seriously craving a Mexican fix and you're in the area, sure, go for it."

I'm not sure what it says about me that I much prefer those rotating crullers you see on sale at american fairs and theme parks.places like this are the bane of a food review: they have passably good food - sufficient for a mild hey-check-this-place-out-if-you're-there recommendation, but nothing to render any enthusiasm or aggravation over; service is a little haphazardly absent, but helpful enough when you get it; and the place is done up open-air and without air-conditioning, pleasant enough for a bit of a loiter.my friend says it's ""like fast food mexican"" - and I concur. it incites just about the same level of enthusiasm those joints would - sufficiently reliable enough for a quick meal, but nothing quite enough to shout about."

I'm probably one of five people in the world that doesn't drink coffee. I know how to grind beans and make coffee in a french press for my mum, I love the smell of coffee brewing and when it pops up in savory food and sweets...but I just hate the taste of coffee as a drink. No matter how much milk, sugar, nothing, best beans, kona beans, any beans, my man has tried to get me to drink it and the most I've tolerated is 2 sips. The one time I drank a caramel latte in Japan because I totally misread the menu, it was really sweet and suddenly I was talking non-stop for an hour. Since this IS a coffee joint, my dude has his two cents in this review. He had a decaf black and in his words ""it's wonderful. very smooth"". So there.Now on to the food. We're really brunch people so we were looking for food more than coffee. When I say I'm a brunch person it's not because I like to dress up to eat a meal I can cook at home. I'm actually a hungry person, I like brunch foods and someone always wakes up too late to fire up the pan. Anyway, we had the french toast and a breakfast sandwich (can't remember the exact name) and both were pretty good.  My french toast was made of 3 thick slices of brioche sliced up, drizzled with a caramel sauce with bananas and nuts drizzled over. It was beautiful to see and a hearty portion for my rumbling tummy. Here's the problem: the egg wash wasn't soaked through the bread. Whhhhhhhhy? It would've been perfect otherwise. If there's a monkey jimmy listening - please soak the toast, turn the heat low and cook that baby.The breakfast sandwich was a standout. A generous, fluffy omelet sandwiched between avocado slices, ciabatta and a sweet-ish tomato chutney. It was brilliant, huge and I would eat it again. And again. So that's a winner right there.What didn't I like? The guys on shift probably partied until 4am and decided to bring their music to work. Bad trance music in a coffee shop is just wrong. Especially at 2pm on a Saturday. That gave me a headache and I shouldn't be getting one at a place where there's a toilet bowl watching me eat."

This was not a wallet-friendly brunch but I was happily surprised by how tasty everything was. The french toast comes in a healthy serving, and includes berries and crème fraîche.

Seating is fairly limited, but somehow sufficient for the number of patrons. It gets a little warm, and the space does feel a little cramped. Nonetheless there are a variety of seating options depending on what you're up to."

This is not surprising - Jimmy Monkey's Ironbark blend is a combination of beans from Brazil (Cerrado), Papua New Guinea (Sigri), Columbia (Kachru), Guatamala (La Laguna) and Peru (Amazonas). There is also a Columbian single origin blend available, which works well in pourover coffee. Each bean variety contributes something unique to the shot - hints of citrus, and even some chocolate notes. Ironbark is a blend that is still evolving, and is now on it's third iteration. The experimentation has paid off, leaving a full bodied shot with a lingering aftertaste.The cappuccino that I ordered was notable for the initial strong hit of coffee flavour, complemented by smooth, light foam and finished with well executed latte art. The microbubbles in the foam add the smooth, silky mouthfeel that I look for, and is seen in quality cafes. This is where Ironbark is used to good effect - the lingering aftertaste is a strong base for a milk based drink, ensuring that the fundamental coffee character is retained.I had a Piccolo also, which is characterised by a more robust coffee taste, with the aftertaste lasting through the milk and foam. The milk complements the robust coffee flavour, smoothing it but not smothering it, creating a hybrid which retains the best characteristics of each - its just right and well executed. Their original place in the piccolo latte hall of fame post is deserved, and retained. There are also pourover, syphon and chemex coffees available. This is a good choice for anyone in the West of the island, and worth a quick trip on the MRT for coffee lovers elsewhere."

To be honest, it isn't that difficult to find and is merely a 7 minute walk from one-north MRT station if you take the right exit (exit B). The service is great and the staff are really friendly and helpful, offering me recommendations of their foods and drinks as I stared at the menu. There is also free wifi, and being hidden away from the crowd it makes a good quiet place for getting some work done on a weekday afternoon. The place has a homely, yet pretty rough industrial vibe. I can't really place it but its a gruff kind of cool. They do a good cup of flat white and the coffee has a bold full-bodied flavour that is pretty satisfying. I had a go at their new introduction to the menu, the yolkless cheesecake, and have to say that it was so goooood! It was rich without being heavy, it is almost like having the best of both worlds.

Finally! With it being at One-North, its really kinda difficult to get to, but actually it was quite convenient via the Circle Line and it is actually just one stop away from Holland Village! Heard some good things about this place, but was also warned that it gets really stuffy and smelly inside because they cook food inside without proper ventilation! So I approached the door with trepidation, because I really don't like greasy smells on me after I leave a food place.Luckily that didn't happen! It was actually quite empty, with a few patrons, perhaps that's why there was not much cooking. The aircon perched on the high ceiling was on a full blast.I was taking photos of the place upon walking in when the chefs and barista gamely posed for a photo (w/o me asking!). That's so cute, and funny. The cafe has a little bit of an abandoned warehouse industrial feel, yet they made it rather New York lofty as well. The decor is casual but comfortable.I was expecting a much smaller place as well, but the size was actually quite spacious with very high ceilings.Prices are ok! $4-6 for coffees, and they have alcoholic drinks too. They also do the Lazy Weekend menu. Looks quite awesome, might have to go back and try! What I hear is that they roast and sell their own coffees. Perhaps I was lucky, but the cafe was a very good experience for me. Venture forth with the warning on the smell, and hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"

Initially, I thought ""Jimmy Monkey"" was a supplier of coffee beans. To my surprise they are a cafe which roast their own beans (and hence name it after themselves)! A very hipster one in fact! My friend brought me there after lunch to grab a Soya latte which I was skeptical about at first. My prejudice against Soya lattes stems from the fact that their drinkers are commonly stereotyped as dieters. Refusing to be labelled as one of them, I have abstained from ordering a Soya latte... until today. My friend was raving about their Soya latte so much - how light & nutty it was... etc - that I knew I had to give it a try (at least just this once). Anyways, it was a quick-in-&-out dash not long enough for any snooty purist coffee drinker to give me the stink eye for ordering a Soya latte. So I did it. To my surprise... the Soya latte was really GOOD... even better than normal latte! I am a convert. It had a nice nutty flavor (just as my friend promised) and doesn't taste like the sweet stuff you get from Mr.Bean or at soybean packet drinks from NTUC. The Soya milk didn't overpower the coffee flavor. In fact, it tasted a lot like milk ... only less creamy (which I prefer) ... & thus help enhance the coffee ( I think). I was pleasantly surprised. The brand of Soya milk they used is called - Silk - which I am told is one of the best. Can't wait to grab a pack at the nearest cold storage on my way home.My next coffee will definitely be a Soya Latte!"

This time, my prayers were not answered. I ordered the eggs benedict, which we borderline inedible. Had it not been for the fact that I walked around 10 mins trying to find the place and was starving I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did. But, and there is a but, it was a matter of ingredients and not execution. The muffin was grainy and doughy, ham was thick and dry and the hollandaise was sour and sparse. The greens the put on the plate were straight from a salad packet you get at Fair Price.  The egg, surprisingly, was cooked perfectly. The person purchasing the ingredients really needs to step it up because they are ruining an otherwise capable kitchen. The ugly: Too secluded and not tasty enough for a must return. Also, the pricing is too high ($30+ for eggs benedict, OJ and latte) and there wasn't anything that stood out (including the drinks).

Taste-wise they have a stronger, slightly more bitter profile to their coffee.They're probably the only coffee place to do 'serious' food, as in they have a huge food menu. Most of it is executed quite well. I wouldn't go as far as to say the food is great, but it's comforting and quite unique. They have toast soldiers, good tarts, decent desserts, savoury pastas and a lot of sandwiches. All of those things are, I feel, better than their breakfast sets. But I don't like eggs and meat for brekkie so I guess I'm not the target demographic. The pastas are quite good though.They also have Asahi and some other alcohol, but I haven't had a good time or reason to drink here. I remember them being quite affordably priced though!"

Seats were packed, conversations were everywhere. Thankfully there were only two of us and we managed to squeeze oursevles between groups of friends. Not much was done to conceal the walls and ceilings of the place but anyhow, that did not really matter. No, this cafe did not smell like one; no aroma of coffee.. Just very strong smells of a different types of food being cooked. The menu can be found as 3 sheets of paper stuck onto a clipboard. One page is for dinner only, while, another is weekend brunch only, the other? Drinks. Order and pay at the counter. Food is served shortly.Can I say, I absolutely love their French Toasts??? Served with some cut bananas and pistachios. Awesome. The toasts were, well-toasted and soaked in the egg/milk mix. They were slightly crusty on the outside but was very soft and moist on the inside. One thing though, unless you are a big eater, order this to share. The portion got a little too much for the stomach to handle after a while. A little too ""heavy"". Tried the cappuccino which was, good. Not too bitter and with the almost right proportions of coffee-milk. The friend did not like it for its strong bitter coffee taste but, I found it just right. :)Trust me, if you are looking for a place to chill with close friends, have a chat, relax... this is the place to visit. At least during the day over the weekends. I should be back to check out the night scene! :) Cheers~"

I am sure the residents and nearby laborers appreciate this coffee shop but it is just too out of the way for anyone else to get here.  I finally made the effort because I had to have a meeting near Holland V.  I was struck by the strange interior; it doesn't match the vibe of the website.  Call me crazy, but consistent branding is something I pay attention too.When I first ordered they were charging me $15 for a beet salad so I negotiated for a smaller salad at 2/3 the price and was a little happier but it still seemed expensive.  I wasn't going to argue with the iced latte.  I love it and would pay every penny for it. The coffee flavor was strong and nutty and they used the good milk.  My beet salad was fine and my friend seemed to like his banana muffin.  We sat undisturbed for two hours sipping coffee and chatting.  Sort of sad such a quiet place isn't a little closer to me; but then it wouldn't be quiet."

I didn't feel like I had wasted my money as I sometimes feel at other places with expensive good food but small portions. The service was excellent. The waitstaff were friendly, prompt with refilling our water and incredibly willing to accommodate demanding customers (I was greatly impressed with how they handled my closest friend with whom I was eating). The atmosphere was really great too - suitable for chill-out gatherings with the focus on good food and even better conversations (and not drinking to get drunk parties), dinner dates, etc. If you do decide to go with a large group, be prepared to sit outside and to wait a while. Seats are limited so do reserve your seats beforehand. My friend tried the Alfredo with Turkey Ham (with extra cream, and with linguine instead of penne) and I tried the Truffled Mac and Cheese. Both were fantastic and I recommend both. I would definitely be back for more!"

Location is especially nice and quiet and not in a mall :-)The impression over the phone was a big let down thanks to an unfriendly lady taking the reservation. After we arrived at the place we were surprised by the nice interior but again the staff was not really welcoming without maybe one exception. Service is okay but nothing special .... And that's exactly what makes a restaurant different to others. Staff seemed not overly interested or charming. The mushrooms as starter were fantastic, calzone was average because of the dough. The other meals were good. Overall we enjoyed the evening thanks to the quiet atmosphere and having dinner outside a mall, but this place could be so much more with a few little improvements. We will anyway come again to try the rest of the menu. We would rate 3.5 if possible."

For some reasons, Original Sin has always attracted a heavily-expat clientèle. It is interesting to note that the customer mix has changed from primarily European to primarily Indian, reflecting the changing expat community in Singapore. What has not changed? First, the décor, which now looks distinctly dated, down to the stains on the bench and chairs! Secondly, the food remains delicious, although one notices changes in the menu - maybe to accommodate new customer preferences? (They now serve veggie tandoori, and moved veggie burger out of the main menu). Prices are not high (especially the set lunch which is very good value). Service is knowledgeable and competent (unlike at the outlet next door). So, I guess we would go back here again!"

If I could only eat vegetarian cuisine, or was dating someone that was vegetarian, or was vegetarian once a week, I'd probably rate this place 4 stars. But since vegetarian for me is a non-existence craving (I go when I want to really change things up, when I'm feeling very jaded, or very unhealthy), that makes Original Sin just A-ok. The Beetroot salad my companion and I shared was rather underwhelming. The salad snob that she is, she found the use of iceberg lettuce vaguely disappointing (the current online menu seems to indicate this has changed; it now says spinach instead of lettuce) and overall it just wasn't a particularly memorable salad, as salads go. Beetroot does not a star make unless it's been treated special or given a good supporting cast.The mains on the other hand, were delicious. The Spanakopita and Lasagna were both hearty, flavourful, absolutely addictive, and very filling. Just typing about it now is making me crave it. And considering I started writing this review over 6 months ago, maybe it's time to revisit Original Sin. Right after I satisfy my steak craving that is."

Cold bim bim bap is fairly hard to review, I mean, it can't really blow you away and it can't really disappoint, but it was as good as bim bim bap gets I suppose. I wish it would have come with egg with a runny yolk, instead of the egg ""strips"" (I can't really describe it), but overall it was alright. The main difference between this Korean restaurant and the Korean stall at the food court downstairs (besides the price) is the side dishes with Korean restaurants are famous for serving to complement your meal. Today it was a spread of four dishes: eggplant, two variations of kimchi, and fried anchovies.  They also provided a seawood soup.For $10, it was a decent meal."

The restaurant is pretty non-discript and could be easily missed. Decor is simple Japanese, service is personal and very good. The menu is simple, choice is omikase only, various prices from $120 to $250. We did the $170 menu. The menu changes by season. We had the autumn menu. All the dishes were integrated with an autumn theme. The menu comprised an eclectic mix of cooked and raw dishes. A mixture of ""usual"" well loved Japanese dishes and many ingredients and preparations that you generally wont find in Singapore. All impeccably presented. Absolutely minimalist and beautiful. All and I mean all the food was super fresh and absolutely delicious. Mind you, there was a dish or two that was ""unusual"" and perhaps not to everyone's taste. To me it was great, and an extension of your culinary experience. An interesting observation is that we were the only non-Japanese at the restaurant. Maybe they know something we don't. The exec chef is Tadashi Takahashi a Tokyo born chef that has been in Singapore for over 5 years. This restaurant is highly recommended. I will probably come 4 times a year to sample the various menus. The upcoming Winter menu showcases snow crab. I can't wait."

Chili crab of course. If you Yelp chili crab in Singapore, you'll get a handful of returns with some very good reviews. I'm by no means an expert at guiding you to find this stuff in Singapore. Fortunately, we knew a local who graciously took us out one night to get some.Master Crab aka Lucky Yu Seng...We took a cab to this spot and if you ask me how to get there, I can't even tell you because I'm a tourist from the states. All I can tell you is that it's in this open air food court attached to some high rises, next to a parking lot that has a gate arm meaning you'll probably have to pay on the way out. The place isn't fancy. Actually, it's pretty grimey. Don't expect a nice air conditioned room, bright lights, or plate and silverware made out of the finest ceramics. Hell, I would tell you to avoid the bathroom if you could especially if you're a female or if you have to drop a deuce. I twinkle standing up and I still felt a little dirty. Now, if you can look past all that like I can, you're golden.Be ready for some Sri Lankan mud crab. Sounds dirty don't it? Walk by where they keep the live crabs and you'll know see why they're called mud crabs. The key is not to order the biggest or fattest one. Ask for a smaller one and maybe a female if you're into the eggs. Young meat is tender and juicy. Like lobster, the big and older ones are chewy and long out of their prime.  Our host ordered not only the chili crab but the salty egg crab. Be ready to get down and dirty. You may even want to pack your own napkins or paper towel because the napkins on the table disintegrate the minute you lay hands on them cheap things. They do provide you with a metal bowl of water and lime to bathe your icky hands in. This will be a messy meal, I guarantee it. I can't distinguish which sauce I liked better. The chili crab wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be but the heat just lingers around and the sauce is tasty. The salt egg crab sauce is rich and fatty. I honestly will say it's a toss up between the two sauces for me. Make sure you order the little fried bread. It's a perfect pairing with the crab sauces; double/triple dip for your pleasure.Since it was right around Chinese New Year, we also had the traditional Singaporean New Year dish. It's a medley of a bunch of items from veggies, to fried wonton skins, salmon, and noodles. Our waitress blessed us with each item she threw onto the plate. Grab your chopsticks and start mixing together with your tablemates and make a big deal out of it. That's how they do it out here, so I'll follow the custom and attempt to bless myself with good fortune and luck for the New Year. I don't know the standard pricing for this stuff but for three people it came out to about $160-170 Singaporean dollars. I personally didn't think it was going to be that much and I our lovable host wouldn't let us pick up the tab. I felt bad for not eating every single crab meat and sucking the shell dry after I saw the tab. So be ready for an awesome meal but it's going to get messy and it isn't exactly cheap. I personally enjoyed the food here but I will tell you that it's pretty rich and eating it often may drive your personal check-up doctor mad.Master Crab even gave me a deck of cards for Chinese New Year on my way out. Thank you for the memorable experience Master Crab and big props to our generous host which I will call ""Chef C"" for showing us this spot."

Been here twice. The first time maybe about 2 years ago. It was not bad but it did not leave an impression. Went back again today and since I was having very much a crab eating spree for the past week, decided instead on prawns, fish, pork, tofu and vege. The fried fish and tofu was highly recommended by the waitress and came as a real disappointment. Fish is deep fried with sweet soy sauce - looks great but way it was over-fried. Tofu - again looks great - but came in a puddle of golden thick gravy which turned out to be pumpkin gravy with bits of prawns and some deep fried crispy noodles-like thing on it. Was totally not impressed and a friend didn't even bother touching it.Maybe it is just good for its crab.... Then again, didn't leave an impression on me the first time round. Don't think will be going back anytime soon..."

Quality of food and service standards are about the same as all other Sushi Tei's in Singapore but this place somehow does not have those long snaking lines as compared to those in perhaps Vivocity or Tampines Mall.So, if you want a Sushi Tei in the west where the queues are shorter, this is the place to go.Get the Salmon Sashimi with Sushi Tei dressing which is a good appetizer / starter or can even function as a full meal if you're not a big eater. If you like shellfish, go for the hotate miso mayo that's basically mussels baked in a cheesy-mayo sauce. Other things to try are the dragon roll, curry cutlet rice, beef sukiyaki, cawanmushi, and special unagi roll that comes with thick slabs of grilled eel"

When our order of pork katsu was served, we were quite taken aback by the rather charred looking dish; it was as if they refried it multiple times before serving. The manager (of all people) was the person who served the dish so she very quickly said she will bring us a new one and we were glad we asked for it. the new katsu came perfect in golden brown crust and was really delicious. The tempura looked pale and was served without the dipping sauce. When highlighted to the staff who served us, he told us that the sauce is not available. we looked at him in disbelief and he quickly muttered that he'll ask the kitchen and disappeared. soon the manager came running with our dipping sauce. I'm thankful that at least she's trying to salvage what's left of our impression of the outlet."

The chicken was rather tough. Even with the brand new knife, it was still quite an effort to slice through the slightly dry meat.

Together with a bunch of good friends of theirs, coming together to bring us quality food which they specialized in; Sashimi. Having family in fresh food trading industry, all the sashimi you see at KATTO were self-sourced and self-imported. That was why KATTO promised to serve only the top quality, freshest cuts.Apart from serving premium fish, the rice they used were from Hokkaido. Premium Hokkaido Nanatsuboshi rice that's milled in Singapore to keep the freshness. Together with 18 other grains mixed in, steamed in dashi broth, their version of white/brown rice definitely bring your palate to another level. You could choose cabbage base too, if you're not a carbo loading person.How does this Sashimi ricebox works? For $12.90, you could order 2 mains of 140gm, 2 sides and a base of 250gm grains/salad. Mains were definitely the different varieties of sashimi. As for sides, there were edamame, pickled mushrooms, seaweed salad, miso buttered baby corns, tomatoes, pickled radish, cucumbers etc.My first box was with California Unrolled, Creamy Goma Tuna, paired with 2 sides of Seaweed Salad and Mushroon on top of a mixture of white and brown rice.[1] California Unrolled (Salmon)- It felt like having a California hand roll the ""naked"" ""undressed"" version. I love how creamy this combination was. The sauce was umami. Every bite was filled with generous seafood goodness from the fresh salmon cubes and kani sticks. The crunchiness from the cucumber and the popping of roe in my mouth made every mouthful delightful! Nomnomnom..[2] Goma Tuna- Fresh Tuna cubes soaked in this rich, sesame flavour. The goma dressing was so fragrant! With toasted almonds and sesame seeds mixed in the sauce, so good, you wouldn't want to waste a single drop of it. As the base rice was a little dry, this dressing worked really well to make the grainy rice softer too. Sides:[a] Seaweed Salad- Seaweed were indeed crunchy but tasted too bland for me. Although seaweed was rich in minerals and helps in maintaining collagen in our skin, but if they don't do something to the taste, I guessed I would give it amiss on my next visit.[b] Pickled Mushrooms- Mushrooms, fungus with good source of selenium (antioxidant mineral) and protein, eating more do no harm :) And by chewing these sourish tangy mushrooms, it gave me more appetite to consume more KATTO as the vinegar clears my palate. I liked this choice of side. On my 2nd visit to KATTO, I've chosen Chicken Rice Chilli and Classic Shoyu for my rice box.[3] Chicken Rice Chilli (Salmon)- A twist of asian touch I would call this and KATTO team was really bold to make this flavour. Like how it was named, it tasted just  like our usual chicken rice chilli but with salmon cubes rather than chicken. The seasoning and spiciness wasn't too overwhelming to shadow away the glory of the fresh salmon so it was a rather interesting choice which eventually worked for me.[4] Classic Shoyu (Salmon)- Among all 4 types of sashimi which I tried, this was the most common yet safest choice. Sashimi with shoyu, a classic way of eating, this combi will never go wrong. It was light weight, but the crispy seaweed bits and sesame seeds mixed in did made the overall taste tasted better.Sides:[a] Miso Buttered Baby Corns- Lightly grilled on the surface, these baby corns were still crunchy when bite. They tasted buttery while sweet on the inside. They went really well with the chicken rice chilli salmon sashimi.[b] Pickled Mushrooms- This was my second time choosing mushrooms as one of the sides. I still love it.If you have a smaller tummy space, mini boxes were available too at $7.90 each. For a mini box, you could get 70gm sashimi, 1 side on a 250gm grains/salad base.** Dining experience at KATTO was enjoyable. My tummy was happy :) For $12.90, the portion was definitely sufficient for lunch and most importantly, a healthier choice compared to fried kway teow or roast meat rice :) I find the sashimi flavours bold yet unique. Kinda love these fusion combi that KATTO provides now and awaiting to see new flavours soon! I'm hoping for my onsen egg or maybe teriyaki chicken on the menu soon  **"

The two times that I have visited The Curry Hut, I departed with a wonderfully, happily filled belly - the food here is phenomenal. I am a vegetarian, and I ordered the Palak Paneer twice. I paired the dish with Cheese Naan the first time and Plain Naan the second time. (I suggest you order Plain Naan so as to fully taste and appreciate the multilayered, decadent flavor of the puree itself.) My mom ordered the Paneer Butter Masala the second time with Plain Naan, and the dish reminded us of creamily melded tomato soup, but better. I gave my experiences five stars due to three criteria: the depth, the richness, and the purity of the food. I find depth and richness to be closely related, so my review under these two guidelines may extend over to one another. As I mentioned earlier, our dishes were incredibly multilayered - I was able to taste the different spices, but only detect them in well-balanced hints, fulfilling the ""richness"" guideline. The dish was ""deep"" because it, as a whole, did not strike me as overwhelming - to me, food with depth presents the ingredients in a way that not only embodies the essence of each element but also seamlessly combines them. For example, even though the spinach is pureed in Palak Paneer, it did not seem adulterated or overpowered by the other ingredients (the cream, paneer, spices). Finally, bear with me here, my digestive system attests to the ""purity"" of the food. The Curry Hut mentions at the beginning of their menu how they use fresh, high quality ingredients, and how each incorporated spice plays a specific role in regulating the digestive system, and I definitely tasted the difference. I know that after eating at some restaurants, I feel bloated and heavy, but this was NOT at all the case at The Curry Hut! Especially with the thickness of the dishes we ordered, you would think that you'd feel puffy, but not here. I would feel light and internally energized. I highly, highly recommend this place to anyone who loves authentic Indian cuisine. I haven't tried the other offerings on the menu, but I'm sure they're delicious! The dishes we selected were reasonably priced and definitely worth it. The people here are also really nice and helpful, which contributed to a relaxing ambiance. Will be returning again whenever I visit Singapore - so, so, so satisfied. GREAT job!!!"

With some searching, we ended up to choose Curry Hut as our place to go.To sum it up: very good quality curries with possibility to tune the vindaloo's spice level. Good service, reasonably priced.The restaurant is located in the Holland Village. It is popular shopping and dining destination for younger Singaporeans and expatriates, it is dominated by and often visited solely for its eateries and watering holes.We ordered a mix of different starters plus main courses - and ended getting a lot of food. There is a wide variety of foods that you can choose, so I can't cover all what's available. We ended up choosing chili shrimps, chicken tikka, murgh korma and oh-so-spicy Vindaloo lamb. Their tandoori is very good and the Chicken Tikka was excellent. Korma and others were ok, but missing something I can't really pinpoint. Vindaloo is their only dish where you can adjust the spiciness level to maximum (you can adjust others too, but to my understanding not to great extent). The levels are from 1 to 5 and I chose with level 4 spicy factor. I am used to lots of chili and this was a good choice for me: enough kick but still good taste. I could have gone for level 5 too, I don't think it would have been too much. But this was just ok to me. I prefer also taste in the curry ;) Vindaloo wasn't as rich in flavor I would have liked it to be, but was ok.The naan was also good. My favorite restaurant back home makes the best naans, but this gets pretty close. Service was warm and attending. The interior of the restaurant is a bit too neutral (and definitely not indian) but it didn't matter much. The name of the restaurant and the look of the place just doesn't make an appealing combo to any passer by. I would have not chosen this place if I hadn't read other reviews and feedback from other customers. But don't get alarmed, you will get good food inside!All in all, a 4+ stars in total. Two excellent curries and two ok ones. Price level was pretty average (we dined for $200 with 4 dishes and starters and three glasses of house wine)."

If you've tasted their normal sticky bones before. Think of these as sticky bones with a hint of sweetness over the thick slab of meat. A perfect fusion of Christmas flavours on ribs indeed. I would say, I couldn't distinctively taste the hazelnut or the cranberry but they both added a sweet pleasant flavour that were done to perfection on the ribs.Crackling Pork Roast $38.90+ 1kg Pork Belly roasted & braised to deliver tender & juicy meat paired with crispy crackling skin. You can't get enough of it.I love Pork Bellies especially the ones with the least fats and with crispy skin! The pork belly was delightfully tasty with a rich and lean texture and a light sweetness. The meat was mostly tender but there was a bit of chewiness here and there where it might have dried out a little from sitting.Roast Chicken $32.90+ Juicy & plump chicken, stuffed with Rosemary, onions, celery & carrots, Served with Roasted Potatoes. (1.4kg)I didn't quite expect such a good tasting roasted chicken at Morganfield's as they are more famous for their ribs. But the chicken was so tender, it was extremely easy to eat the chicken.

Being the foodie nation that we are, we've had a slew of foreign restaurants open their doors on our tiny island over the years. Steakhouses like Outback, rotisseries like Kenny Rogers and of course restaurants specializing in good ol' BBQ ribs. For years, Tony Romas have been spear heading the rib-olution in Singapore and for years they have been doing a great job. But like all great restaurants, the key to longevity is fighting off the competition. From Smokey's to Jerry's and now, Morganfield's. Though it's opened its doors for a few years now, I haven't had the chance to try it till now and I have to say.... Sadly... That their sides are better than the ribs. Since it was Father's Day, we decided to go with the Ocean Feast ($119.90) with a couple of additional sides. Beer Battered Fish Fillets. Crispy better but they used either dory or sutchi (Although I have the feeling it's the latter), which I'm not a big fan of. It's not the tastiest fish in terms of texture or flavour. Tequila Grilled prawns were nice. Sweet, well seasoned and juicy. Of course like all prawns, don't let them then cold if not they'd turn semi-bullet on you. Grilled Sausages were fairly normal and you could get similar ones at a supermarket.Grilled corn on a cobs were nice. Sweet, well grilled. Corn bread. The star of the platter. The corn bread was sweet and very moist. Definitely a million times better than what you get at Kenny Rogers. Hickory BBQ RibsWhile the sauce was pretty good, and the meat does fall off the bone, it did feel a bit overly cooked. The area with ample fat was good while the rest felt a bit dry. Chilli Con carne (side dish) Hmmm... A little disappointed with the Chili. While it was tasty, it felt more Bolognese sauce than Con Carne with the distinctive lack of beans. Coleslaw Pretty good coleslaw and a good dish to break the meatiness of the platter. Pilaf Rice If you're a fan of Aston's tasty rice, you will LOVE the pilaf rice here. It was moist and very very good. While the food quality was average, we were pretty disappointed with the service. Forgotten drinks, sides coming a good 15 mins before the main platter and the platter itself took nearly 45 mins to arrive, it certainly wasn't a good first impression. On a whole, with a little bit of tweaking, Morganfield's could very well be the best BBQ / Sticky Ribs in Singapore but till then....."

The food is decent, I did enjoy the hickory bbq ribs, and their corn bread is good, an American couldn't make it any better. Servings are generous, especially if you order the family platters. And there's happy hour too. Wait, did I fail to mention that kids under 8 eat free on weekends? So they are doing quite a few things right. And budget wise, for my group of 3 adults and 4 kids, with drinks, it didn't blow a massive hole in my pocket. Worked out to less than $20 per head. It's not all bad. Which is really a shame. If they were just to improve on their service a tad, they could really jump up a few notches, and Yelpers wouldn't have to wonder whether to give them a 3 or a generous 4, but instead just brandish a 5 or a stingy 4! So Morganfield's, it's really up to you now. Give us something great, you're not far off."

It's the Morgansfield's Christmas Platter ($149.90++) that contains more than enough meat to probably last an individual till the next Christmas. But the good thing is that you don't have to beat the clock to finish this; neither do you have to embark on a solo meat conquest as this can be shared theoretically with 4-5 pax, or realistically speaking, even 6 or more. Sourced from Spain, Morganfield's showpiece sticky bones have been updated with a seasonal festive touch by tempering it with some American Rogue Hazelnut Nectar. The result is a rich, shiny, dark brown caramelized glaze and the meat underneath has a lovely smoky quality. The best part is the slighty charred crust that has such a smooth malty taste that keeps me nibbling on the crispy edges.Bathed in a reddish hue, the Cranberry Sticky Bones didn't taste as fruity as expected but the bits of cranberry sweetened the deal. The meat turned out to be more moist than the Hazelnut beer, with bits of fat tucked incongruently between layers.I sometimes wonder why restaurants like to serve turkey and not the turkey drumsticks? These two massive Smoked Turkey legs, like a miniature monolith on the plate, has a great chewy texture that makes you want to gnaw all the way down, leaving the bone bare. But I was particularly drawn to the Ham as the mildly sweet juicy honey glaze makes the meat even more appealing to the tastebuds. There was plenty more to discover on the plate with four beautiful bouncy sausages that reclined lazily on each other. Spicy Italian, Cheese, German Pork, each has a character on its own but the Cheese sausage grabbed the attention with delectably gooey cheese spurting out at the instant cut of the knife. Non-carnivores need not avert your eyes from the plate as there are plenty of greens to balance the plate; soft caramelized onions, steamed carrots, long beans, roasted potato. The Signature cornbread, a crumbly sweet corn muffin with crusty top, fully qualifies as a delicious pre-dessert snack or maybe even as a dessert for some. Christmas or not, there is always good reason to come for Morganfield's honest-to-goodness sticky bones because the quality still stays consistent as my previous visit. And, my nostrils confirmed this as soon as the meat platter made its entrance on the table, it's great."

Chunks of it were still attached to the ribs, most restaurants will just serve the meat but this is THE GOLD. It would have been flawless if not for the copious amount of sauce slathered on the ribs - it felt like i was drinking an extremely tangy soup at times.

But the good thing is that you don't have to beat the clock to finish this; neither do you have to embark on a solo meat conquest as this can be shared theoretically with 4-5 pax, or realistically speaking, even 6 or more. Sourced from Spain, Morganfield's showpiece sticky bones have been updated with a seasonal festive touch by tempering it with some American Rogue Hazelnut Nectar. The result is a rich, shiny, dark brown caramelized glaze and the meat underneath has a lovely smoky quality. The best part is the slighty charred crust that has such a smooth malty taste that keeps me nibbling on the crispy edges.Bathed in a reddish hue, the Cranberry Sticky Bones didn't taste as fruity as expected but the bits of cranberry sweetened the deal. The meat turned out to be more moist than the Hazelnut beer, with bits of fat tucked incongruently between layers.I sometimes wonder why restaurants like to serve turkey and not the turkey drumsticks? These two massive Smoked Turkey legs, like a miniature monolith on the plate, has a great chewy texture that makes you want to gnaw all the way down, leaving the bone bare. But I was particularly drawn to the Ham as the mildly sweet juicy honey glaze makes the meat even more appealing to the tastebuds. There was plenty more to discover on the plate with four beautiful bouncy sausages that reclined lazily on each other. Spicy Italian, Cheese, German Pork, each has a character on its own but the Cheese sausage grabbed the attention with delectably gooey cheese spurting out at the instant cut of the knife. Non-carnivores need not avert your eyes from the plate as there are plenty of greens to balance the plate; soft caramelized onions, steamed carrots, long beans, roasted potato. The Signature cornbread, a crumbly sweet corn muffin with crusty top, fully qualifies as a delicious pre-dessert snack or maybe even as a dessert for some. Christmas or not, there is always good reason to come for Morganfield's honest-to-goodness sticky bones because the quality still stays consistent as my previous visit. And, my nostrils confirmed this as soon as the meat platter made its entrance on the table, it's great."

Ordered the Garlic BBQ spare ribs (about SGD$24 for half slab. Full slab will be around SGD$40) - comes with sides of fries and coleslaw. The meat is really tender! Wanted to share but everytime I dig into it with my fork, only a small piece get removed - PERFECT, get the whole thing to myself heehee. Nicely charred on the top, sides and LOVE the cartilage. Chunks of it were still attached to the ribs, most restaurants will just serve the meat but this is THE GOLD. It would have been flawless if not for the copious amount of sauce slathered on the ribs - it felt like i was drinking an extremely tangy soup at times. A thin layer and additional sauce on the side would be a better presentation option imo.Also had a serving of Garden Salad - meh.

The spicy gumbo soup was an instant hit, though it seemed to have taken some local flavors in the process. The main dish itself was a little but of a let down. The steak was cooked to medium rare as requested, but it seemed to have been charbroiled instead of been properly grilled. Which is rather weird for a restaurant of this establishment. Overall atmosphere was fine, not too noisy, though the mounted small TV screens showing Popeyes might not be the right choice for the crowd that comes to eat here. Might come back for a second try.

Having said that, the noisy environment and the slow service makes me quite apprehensive to consider a return visit. A note to the management. This place is understaffed. The service staff were largely polite and friendly but they were so hard to catch. And our food took more than 30 minutes to arrive. Which is not exactly acceptable. However, the manager was rather apologetic after we made the delay known to him and made amends by offering us a free dessert. And the lava cake was actually quite yummy so appeased I am.The acoustics of this restaurant is kind of shite. The noise level was terrible. It was understandably crowded but the noise pollution was rather unbearable. Not a place for decent conversation. Just come here for the steak."

There is plenty of nicely briyani'd rice and a dollop of pineapple-cucumber pickle. The curry is robust enough to make eating the curried rice alone a nice enough meal.  The chicken doesn't bring much to the meal, but adds a nice bit of substance to what is otherwise an austere offering.  At $5 a pop for the chicken briyani, you'll fill up nicely, but not be as satisfied as if you'd be if you had the same meal at Sheik's Curry at the Ayer Rajah Food Centre (see my Yelp review; shameless plug such as it is). This place is A-okay and they've been doing it for a good long while, plus it's in my own backyard, and I do like to promote and support local businesses.  They make my hood what it is and I do love my hood.

I think its meant to be a sports bar, even though nothing was showing on the large television the day I visited. The place is also rather comfortable- even the toilets are really clean.I tend to snack alot especially when drinking, and was thus pleasantly surprised to find out that The Pit had a wide selection of 'bar food' (all deep friend and super sinful) all of which were my favourites. Lucky I had the company of friends so I took the liberty to order pretty much the two things I wanted to try: the Buffalo Wings and the Jalapeno Poppers. They tasted great. Even though the wings were deep fried, they were not apparently oily and still retained a crisp juiciness. The sauce was also fantastic (spicy enough) and was coated on the wings in the right proportion. The Jalapeno Poppers were also done right: each individual portion was not too large and is fried to perfection. Definitely my favourite bar food place in Holland Village."

And the price is not too steep either! For about $5/pax, you can get a nice steaming pot of clay pot cooked over a legit charcoal oven (most food these days are cooked over gas stove), filled with salted fish, pork sausage and chicken. The plethora of flavors make this a really tasty dish (for halal customers you can also ask for the pork sausage to be removed). Rice is soft, chicken pieces are tender and the salted fish really adds a whole new dimension.Furthermore, you get to decide how much oil and black sauce to add. Usually I would add until about 90% of the rice grains are black (my stirring sucks, sadly), and oil until the grains are shiny enough. Yes, this sounds unhealthy, but once in a while dish, it's worth it!And usually, we would add some soup as a side. I recommend watercress soup.Note that the food centre is like almost entirely closed save for this stall at night, so seats are aplenty. And yes, like what the other reviewers have mentioned, call in advance to place your order, so you don't have to subject yourself to a 1.5hr wait.

Then I moved away and made my way back again when I was in university, only because of the proximity. Don't get me wrong, the claypot rice is actually pretty good in my opinion.  The stall still sticks to using charcoal for their cooking and this gives the final dish a nice smoky flavour. One thing I love is the little salted fish bits that they put inside the rice along with the chicken and sausage slices - there are others who think of them as nothing more than little balls of salt but I beg to differ.Part of the fun of going to New Lucky is being able to decide how much sauce goes into your dish. At the start of the meal, you are given two metal cups - one filled with dark sauce, the other with fragrant oil. And, they leave it entirely up to you how much you want to put into your rice. I have had an instance where this went horribly wrong and I ended up having to eat rich swimming in oil thanks to a friend's horrible estimation skills. So remember to leave the flavouring to someone trustworthy!"

I've always heard about how this claypot rice served with chicken was one of the best in Singapore, so I decided to give it a try once. While it is true that they are one of the rare stalls in Singapore still making use of charcoal to cook their rice, I don't find it to be as mind-blowing as some describe it to be. One good point however is how they add small pieces of salted fish to flavour the rice - which is not done by all stalls selling this dish. However the rice itself may or may not be too dry for my taste, and it is this inconsistency that I have a love-hate thing with. But to have it cooked for us true-blue Singaporean style with real charcoal is a great experience. Another plus point is that they serve various home-cooked soups as well. Try getting the lotus soup or black chicken soup to soothe your throat after a heaty meal like claypot rice - especially if you like the burnt rice portions like me!"

There are also combos and student discounts too. All in all a complete meal will set you back by slightly above $10.

The true gem at this restaurant though, is their Silky Chicken Rice that is just another name for Steamed Chicken, White Chicken or Hainanese Chicken Rice.I wouldn't recommend going for just one plate but rather a group of 2-3 people going for half a Silky White Chicken. I can say that its one of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice I've eaten, having enjoyed it from a young age the taste remains constant most of the time. (They do have their off days sometimes)The half a Silky White Chicken comes in a larger than usual portion, being served on an oval plate and covered with their signature oyster sauce (!!) Ensure that the chicken is soaked in a thick pool of oyster sauce, if its just a drizzle make sure to ask for more or it really doesn't do a dish justice. The smooth texture of the chicken skin and meat combined with the tastiness of the oyster sauce makes it one of the best chicken rice around. Of course you must make sure that every piece of chicken you eat is drenched in oyster sauce, or else you won't get to eat the unique flavour of the chicken. (In the past they always gave loads of oyster sauce, but nowadays I only seem to get it from time to time)The chicken is submerged in ice cold water to give the skin a smoo texture and keep the meat moist and tender after cooking. So don't expect a steaming hot plate of chicken but rather an ice cold (as a compliment) plate of chicken covered in delicious oyster sauce. The rice itself is also wonderfully fragrant and goes along very well with the chicken.Overall, I must say that it is one of my top favourite Chicken Rice stalls on the island over the years with the standard remaining consistent most of the time though I have been disappointed on a few of my trips there. The char siew is also great there with large thick long slices of char siew with a deliciously thick char siew sauce instead of the usual dry thin tasteless char siew that most places serve. But do not go there for the Hor Fun as you will be sorely disappointed, the chicken rice is the one to try!"

It's not fragrant, and there's no sign of the crispy charred rice, looks like it's not as good as the excellent version at New Lucky at nearby Holland Drive. Edible, but the food at many hawker stalls would be much better than this!"

I've seen the restaurant grow from a tiny shop expanding into two shop spaces and now, its most recent reincarnation as a fast casual restaurant. Now back to a single shop space, they've done a creative job with their decor - cheap chic if you will. You get air-conditioned comfort but much of the old charm of the original place is now sanitized and gone. We ordered the two-person set to sample more. We got a plate of hor fun and a plate of noodles, soy sauce chicken and roast pork, kai lan, dumpling soup, and 2 glasses of luo han guo. Not a bad deal for $21+ considering the serving sizes of the noodles/hor fun were pretty big. The standouts were the roast pork with its crispy skin, the kai lan, and the refreshing luo han guo drinks. It's sad that the soy sauce chicken and hor fun are pretty unmemorable since it's their namesake but all in all, it's still a decent spot for lunch although you can probably find better food for your money than the once-famous ""Holland V Ipoh Hor Fun."""

I think I could easily eat a larger bowl, but the small individual size is perfect for a quick snack. I could see it also being a meal substitute! The location is also extremely convenient to the gardens. Not a lot of space in terms of parking and seating, but there a couple locations in town and it's a very popular place.

I always get the Coffee America-No smoothie, which was spot on and amazing the first time I tried it. I feel like since our first visit, the quality of the smoothie has declined on the following days (hence the 3 stars). Today's was the worst. We ordered 2 smoothies and both of them came out super watery and mine had a lot of banana chunks. Using Day 1's 5 star-quality smoothie as a reference, today and yesterday's smoothies tasted like some ingredients were missing -- eg the cacao nibs and the almond butter. I certainly hope that's not the case, because a cup of this stuff isn't  exactly cheap. I think the shop could employ some stricter standardization practices. Other than that, we love the atmosphere and overall vibe of the shop. This shouldn't take away from the high rating that their açaí bowls deserve. Maybe we'll stick to their bowls for now :)"

We shared the lobster ravioli (3.5 stars), which my friend really enjoyed, and the crabmeat linguine (3 stars). I'd had the former on a previous visit a year ago or so and it seemed like the standards have dropped. For the latter, we asked for an aglio e olio sauce instead of the tomato cream sauce it typically comes with so this review isn't of the crabmeat linguine on the menu. I'd had the dish here a year ago and thoroughly loved it but this time it was rather lackluster. Ample crabmeat, but somehow the dish wasn't very flavorful. I'll have to hunt down another place for crabmeat pasta now...I was a little annoyed that the waiter misunderstood us when we asked for the crabmeat linguine to be prepared with an olive oil sauce, brought a plain aglio e olio pasta, then said he'd have to charge us for it since they'd prepared it for us. Nice try buddy. I pointed out (nicely) that it was an error on his part and he agreed to correct the order, though he emphasized that he was making an exception. One of the other waiters who helped us out made a couple of jokes and we appreciated his friendliness! Service really depends I suppose.

Recommended to eat at this place with a group of people!I had one dish, which was the Milk Powdered Pork Ribs with rice. I had lunch at about 1.30pm here, the place was relatively deserted. Serving time was relatively quick as well. The dish itself was quite interesting! The milk powder seems to have been fried and isn't simply just sprinkled over the pork ribs, hence you wouldn't have to worry about any moisture over coagulating the powder. The sweetness of the milk powder goes very well with the fried pork ribs. I highly recommend not to order this dish if you're having a sore throat or dislike dry dishes, because this dish really does sap the moisture out of your mouth."

They come up with original recipes on top of making your usual zhi char fare, so there is a great variety of dishes to choose from, and they are all very well done.We ordered the usual dishes such as... kang kong - which was super spicy! The prawn paste fried chicken was tasty but nothing special in my opinion. The shrimp omelette was very tasty and flavoursom, and the deer meat with spring onions was tasty and tender. But dishes are the norm. Well cooked and tasty, but their signature dishes are something to rave about.I love cockles, but I am very particular about them. I dare say that this place serves my favourite cockles dish - served cold and drenched in an intensely flavoursome sauce made with fresh chilli padi, garlic, and chives.Instead of the normal butter pork dishes every zhi char place has, they also have a milk powder version of the dish. I know it doesn't sound great, but I found it less rich than the butter pork and a lot more palatable. It can't be too healthy, but the flavour and texture you get from the milk powder is really something else.I really enjoyed their home-made tofu with mushrooms. It had a nice thick sauce with minced meat drizzled all over it. The texture and consistency of the tofu was lovely and I couldn't get enough of it. Definitely worth coming to eat here I say! I'll be back to try their other dishes, and I'll update you all with another review then!"

According to their signboard they only rest for 2 hours from 3pm to 5pm. This place is a 10-min walk from Commonwealth MRT, but it can be quite difficult to find if you are taking a taxi. Have a map in hand if you are trying to locate this place, or go with someone who knows about it.With that special dish of milk powder butter pork which I have never seen before elsewhere. It is also always very packed during dinner time but the people are very efficient at seating everyone and serving the food, which is good. Every other dish seems average only compared to the butter pork, but pricing is on the higher side for regular tze char so be prepared. I guess there's a premium when you have a USP to bank on."

Start with the cockles - even if the thought of having them raw irked me a ilttle but I love this enough to get myself a hepatitis B jab so I feel safe chomping down on these babies. What really makes it so good is the sauce with lots of garlic, so make sure you drown your cockle in it before throwing it down the deep end!My favourite is their three egg spinach, with salted, centuy and the normal egg, a dish I began to notice was in restaurants everywhere, but only after I had it here. To date I still find this the most well done, with such a yum  gravy you'd want to get rice with it. The butter pork is an absolute winner. It seems to be fried pork ribs (boneless) buried under a mountain of milk powder, yet the powder is so sweet my friend guessed that it would perhaps be condensed milk powder, if such a thing even exists? But the novelty and goodness of the powder aside, the pork ribs are fried perfectly - not too thick, not fatty, very crispy...it is best eaten hot of course.I also always get the golden mushroom beancurd, even if it has disappointed me on a few occassions. It's essentially those japanese straw mushrooms in a thick minced pork sauce, a little sweet but very full of flavour.I have genuinely never thought I'd need to try anything else."

The egg and the tau Pok is good too. The braise sauce is very flavourful but yet the meats are still tender. Very worth it for $3! The rice sadly, is not yam rice, but is normal rice.

Unfortunately the reality is not as good as imagined. I don't mind it, but it is definitely not a ""I like it so much I want to keep going back"" kind of place unless I live in the vicinity. Friends like the place and the food (though some said it was quite average). So maybe that skewed my expectations a little. I was there early around 615 pm and a few tables were occupied. I told the manager/owner that I was still waiting for my friend and was thus left alone after being given a menu. No offer of ""Can I get you a drink first?"", even though it was another 15 minutes before my friend finally arrived (bad traffic!). Left to my devices, I checked out the decor. It was the now common industrial look with grey concrete walls and functional tables and chairs. Specials were written on the board hanging on one side of wall. Each table was prettied up with flowers stuck in a jar. At least there was some attention to details. Service was prompt once my friend arrived. Another server came over and told us the specials and brought us water after we placed our order. There were a few things I want to try:- crab cakes (was told it was so-so)- risotto balls (only to order it if you love rice/risotto)- carbonara pasta (it was good, the usual item ordered by friend)- fish and chips (not too bad)- espresso bacon burger (not bad)- buttermilk fried chicken (only available on Wednesday and sometimes Thursday)- fried oreo (selected days, check their FB for availability)** As they only have 1 fryer or something, fried oreo will not be available on Wednesday when it is Buttermilk fried chicken night.**What I ordered in the end:Espresso Bacon Burger-  It was medium like I ordered, pinkish in the center and charred outside. It was a huge ball of meat which sadly fell apart once I sliced it. So I was picking up minced meat the entire meal. The espresso bacon jam just had a hint of the coffee and bacon taste, so mild that it was quite forgettable. Being a jam, it was a bit sweet but I liked it as a foil to the meat and bun. The hand cut fries were alright though looked very dark. I was expecting that as it was written in the menu that it would look dark as they were fresh. Pork chop ordered by friend was said to be good. She liked it. I had iced lemon tea which was freshly brew and sugar syrup was left on the side. I would not mind going again if I am in the area, but I would not go there specially just to dine, but maybe on a Wednesday just to try the buttermilk fried chicken."

Breakfast remains to be decent but I feel that it's bordering on the decline.The menu used to be interesting and imaginative. Now it's mediocre and boring. Portions are small and like other Yelpers have mentioned, it's overpriced. Never once when I came did the chef or the owners who are sometimes at the premises asked the diners if they are happy with the food.The joint is not often full. Hence instead of texting away on their phones or having a smoke, it pays to ask the customers what they thought of the food if they wish to cultivate repeat business. The staff is often very friendly and cheerful. I do miss the long hair girl with the braces. She's the sunshine of the lot. I used to recommend the Little Diner but I doubt the joint is barely keeping up its former glory. It's now just a restaurant trying to make money. Not returning."

I can see how the pancakes would be in in theory, except when I ordered them they were a little undercooked. Undercooked pancakes taste of soggy flour/batter and really no amount of cream cheese or syrup is going to cover that up.That said, my date's Eggs Benedict was pretty good though a little on the small side portion-wise and we were left wondering if we should order more or head somewhere else. In the end we decided to head somewhere else for a burger, but funnily enough I'd stlll be very willing to try Little Diner again just because the service was so friendly.Good people and good service save any dining experience, and I think this was no different.

First sign of trouble was the plating of all the dishes. Token salads, stacked and skewered food looked like compensation of some sort and turned out to be the case.I did note some rather inspired moments on my plate. I did like the fries and the coleslaw that came with my dish, but to serve fried chicken looking and tasting burnt was quite beguiling. I even finished it. Limpid, supplier-style Oreo Cheese cake was not and remained half eaten. A friend's pork chop looked robust but was an unexpected star anise party-in-our-mouths. We were left unsure about that. His apple crumble on the other hand held no surprises, but in a good way.I suggest the owner take a long, hard look at rivals on the market and see what they deliver against what they promise. Right now the output of the kitchen can't cash the cheques. Could have been acceptable in the 90's. Not anymore, not at this price point.I would suggest to lose the gimmicks and get some basics right. Otherwise a great location for a diner.

Nellie was extremely personable, and very thorough with explaining which menus items I should avoid when I mentioned my lactose intolerance.  She even came back to the table concerned that the mushrooms being sauteed in butter might be an issue she hadn't considered, and was relieved when I told her it wouldn't be a problem.  She continually checked in with our table and engaged the girls.  Happily they were not the only children in the restaurant, and several more arrived while we were dining.  To have our children so welcomed at a restaurant boasting a menu & wine list suitable for a nice night out was a pleasant surprise for us. The other waitresses and staff were prompt in delivering our food as it became ready and in clearing unnecessary dishes.  They asked if we needed ketchup or mustard before we had to ask and even had multiple options.  These little details combined to make it a lovely dinner out for our entire family.  It is a great little diner pub and we will certainly be back!  I want my own order of those fish and chips!"

We (let's call him R) certainly appreciated the server checking up on us and serving water quickly when we got seated. +1 for using those umm... jar-mug thingies that the man and I used to use in college. We ordered the red velvet pancakes and eggs benedict and well, both dishes were kind of meh. My first reaction to the pancakes was wow that's a small stack. A small, thin-looking stack of pancakes that goes in-line with the ""Little"" in ""Little Diner"" I guess. I mean that's all I can really say about a stack of pancakes I ate in about 5 mouthfuls. It had some flavor to it but certainly wasn't the rich, dessert-like, thick and fluffy pancakes I was hoping for. The cream cheese frosting was on the side and didn't really taste like cream cheese (or at least what I'd associate with say a cream cheese frosting on cupcakes) and looked kinda awkward, as was the small swivel of cream. However, I must say the side of bacon was very, very well done. Super crisp, bubbling with oil, perfect. The eggs benedict that R ordered because of the honey ham in it was a benedict in name. The muffin was kind of tough and somehow the eggs and ham and hollandaise just didn't meld together and work. We've had some really insane benedict's at  Choupinette, Rider's and the Porch cafe in Bali and this version just didn't, quite, cut it.Bottom line, I'm checking this place off as tried and visited but am unlikely to return. It reminds me of the gastropub down the road - passable food and cool decor, but not enough to make me return again and again. For the price I'm paying I'm sticking with the stalwarts in the neighborhood, even if it means more effort on my part in making reservations."

So glad I decided to pop by this humble joint. At first glance it looks rather ordinary (simple, no fuss, a healthy office worker take-out salad bar) ... but in reality MIND-BLOWING (& healthy too). I think the secret is the a) sauce, b) meat. 1) Big Bird $10.80- I had a wrap. Basically, turkey meat, some toppings (grape, celery, apples) mixed with roman lettuce and the secret sauce of course!The turkey meat was so soft!!! and succulent. I was hesitant to order turkey initially because its meat is usually dry but this was proved my stereotype wrong! 2) Hail Caesar $10- My friend had this. Pretty good. Taste different from the former even though it's pretty much the same ingredients. Impressive a switch of 1) sauce and 2) toppings can have so much impact on the flavor. Definitely looking forward to my next trip back!!! only sad thing is they are located near office areas, raffles place etc. Not typically places one would visit unless it's to go back to work on a weekend."

Besides being perfectly healthy - no preservatives, no additional anything, no fake anything, plus freshness every day, they taste oh-so-good. It's the kind of lunch that will fill you up, despite eating mostly greens, and sustain your contentment till it's time for dinner. For some reason, I don't have the tendency to snack after having Salad Stop lunches.My favourite salad is the Tuna San. The raw tuna, the avocado, mandarin orange, the edamame seeds, they're all my beloved ingredients within one bowl - how can I not love it?Salad Stop sells yoghurt too, they come with separate flavouring such as vanilla or blueberry, and also cereal on the side.

I discovered this little gem after teaching and was looking for a healthy lunch since I've been on a massive veggie detox (well, hoping to stay 80% of the year on this ""detox""). I am so excited to have found a good salad/healthy wrap place in Singapore with crisp veggies. My favorite thing on the menu is the imitation crab wrap. I get it with a tomato wrap. The dressing, the veggies, egg, imitation crab, and toasted tomato wrap makes this such a good eat. The downside to this place is actually the price. $9 for a wrap and $10 for a salad!?! I've also tried their caesar wrap with chicken (was ok..), smoothie w/ mango (was refreshing). This location is also pretty chill and clean.

Staff/Service: Was poor at best. Staff were either looking a bit lost, or not able to multitask and prioritize what's important. Crowd was minimal as it's lunch hour. Staff took about 15mins to attend and seat us. Atmosphere: As a large group with 10pax, restaurant wasn't able to accomodate us indoor, so had no choice but to sit outdoors. Which is still quite alright, except for the occasional flies and mosquitoes. Food:The food was above average. Soup of Lobster Bisquete was exceptionally good, rich in flavor and filling. Mains like the pasta, chicken and fish were all above average as well. Pricing: Reasonable for a lunch offer. Overall: Might be better to come to this place at night, with prior reservation depending on whether you want indoor dining or outdoor dining. The outdoor decor is quite a unique concept, and seem to encourage more chillout sessions than actual meals. Will still go back to this place when important meetings and dinner arises, but definitely not for lunch on a hot or rainy day."

I would still recommend that you make the trek to Adam Road, stand in line and sample the original before assessing the quality of the offerings at any of the growing number of Crave outlets.  It's not that hard to get to...it's a 5 min stroll from the Botanic Gardens MRT station.  I highly recommend this low-hanging food pilgrimage.I do wish this CRAVE outlet at One@KentRidge all the very best!  I hope they end up doing what the two other predecessors that occupied this same space couldn't...stay in business and prosper!  Good luck, CRAVE One@KentRidge, we need you stay open!!"

When I cross the road from Star Vista after church, I wanted to visit this place some time ago.Finally got to visit this restaurant on a Sunday evening. Was attracted by how this place blends between the modern facade of Rochester Mall and a colonial style building at its backyard. The restaurant is a small quaint single storey building. You can choose to dine in the interior brick styled cottage, or at the outdoor alfresco area, much like the Starbucks next door. But I bet it's much more beautiful sitting outdoor from 7pm onwards with candles on your tables. It has that peaceful quiet ambience in this place. In the inside, they play jazz music or Italian sopranos. It's a perfect place for small family gatherings or a couple of friends gathering. Ok time to get on the food. If you visit this place as a couple, I strongly recommend trying Spaghetti Al Cartoccio (for 2 pax) for a start. It's an assortment of seafood and spaghetti baked in parchment with tomato sauce and basil. It may look like a simple dish but the pasta and seafood inside the parchment just brings out the flavor in a much more natural enhancing way than any MSG could. The sauce is superb and very much on par as Pasta Brava, but with a more homely touch. Portion is good for two. It's good for gatherings too as you add on more dishes. The Zuppa Alla Marinara is also a good dish to try out! A thick tomato sauce or white wine sauce with seafood. Yummy!Tagliere Mix, Saumi or Formaggi with the cheese that's specially imported from Italy. The pizzas here I heard are a favorite. The kids will love it. If you're looking for anothe romantic dinner or weekend family dinner that is peaceful, close to the nature and Italian food as authentic as it could be, you shouldn't hesitate to give this place a shot. This has to be one of my top 3 Italian restaurants in Singapore. (I only try those with a realistic price.) *wink*"

Their salads are fresh and crunchy, and also come with a bit of fish roe on top - so pretty. I love their cold soba. My favourite order is the tempura cold soba set. It comes with miso soup and a portion of fruits - usually watermelon and orange. The cold soba is of the perfect consistency, and the accompanying sauce is great for dipping and slurping. The sauce is clean and refreshing, it doesn't stay in your mouth like some soy sauce, it leaves your mouth with a delightful tinge.Other items like the tempura rice set (generous WOW serving of tempura) and cheesy omu rice were great too.

The rucola salad was full of pepper and barely any Parmesan shaved strips were added on it. The florentine steak was delivered medium - well done, even though we've had asked for medium - rare. This wasn't the big issue.We started eating and noticed that actually half of the steak is pure big chunks of fat and only half of it is meat. Not mentioning the bones, as this is standard. So, 1 kg minus the bones and minus the fats is actually maybe 300 g of meat for 120 $.We made the waitress aware of the amounts of fat, but she wasn't impressed by it and brought it back to the kitchen. The chief waitress and the cook inspected it and discussed something amongst each other and then there was no reply.As we were still hungry we went on and ordered a Pizza Napoli, red sauce with buffalo mozzarella. I for sure know that the pizza delivered wasn't buffalo mozzarella for a whopping prize of 26$. Afterwards we asked for the bill and it was brought to us by the chief waitress and we were charged the full prize for the Florentine steak. Even though she had seen the big chunks of fats and had discussed with the waitress who had picked up the dishes from our table, she insisted that she didn't know anything about it.I asked for the person in charge as I would like to discuss this, and she said she's the person in charge.I told her that I saw her looking at the plate with her colleagues and discussing it, how come she doesn't know about it!?! She went back, don't know what she discussed with her colleague again, came back and offered to give us a 15% discount of the steak. That's the best she could do. She will discuss with her vendor for the meat and will make sure that it doesn't happen again....(as it helps me anything on my experience)! I didn't want to make it a big fuzz, as it's obvious that she doesn't care about honest customer service. We paid and surely didn't want the 10$ vouchers as we are not coming back to this place again.The total bill came to 190 $.....In our opinion it's a rip off, low quality food, badly prepared with low quality ingredient, over priced and on top not honest. Don't go there, and look for alternatives...."

I'm a seafood marinara person. Default choice anywhere and theirs didn't disappoint. Fresh seafood and generous in amount too. Pasta was also cooked till al dente which has a slight Q in it. Some place cooked their pasta till it's too soft. The tomato base sauce is not from a can, and if it is, the processing that went into it is damn power then. I'll buy THAT type of can sauce any day!

I would have preferred a chunkier, spicier marinara too, but that's personal preference.the mains were most surprising - both our squid ink risotto and sausage penne had a depth of flavor you might not have expected, so savory and umami-filled it almost seemed too salty (which it wasn't).they don't look like big portions, but they are wholly filling and satisfying - it's interesting to note also that there was rather more sausage than noodle in our pasta dish (which is not an often-seen phenomenon), and the risotto was supplemented rather generously with fresh squid rings and prawns.we finished with a dessert of tiramisu (what else?) - and this was a more than decent rendition, served with boozy brandied cherries and a drizzle of coffee syrup across the plate. it's also not a particularly wet tiramisu (which I might prefer, actually) - you can see that the biscuits are just soaked-enough to provide a sturdy foundation.it's not cheap - this is holland village, after all, but the prices are competitive with other in-town italian establishments. it's more than worth a visit, and a pasta per person makes for a good, decent lunch."

I ordered the set menu for dinner paired with red wine. Overall, the dishes were surprisingly tasty! The foie gras entrée was the fish that amazed me the most. Usually in France we do not mix foie gras with fish, or we try to be minimal when it comes to foie gras. The foie gras from Rhubarb was served with Japanese radish, another type of radish, fish (estragon maybe?) and some sweet jelly. The foie gras was very tender. Pairings all of these ingredients together made the dish heavenly! The dishes in general felt like eating a work of culinary art (well, probably expected from a fine dining restaurant). As of the main, I got the Wagyu beef medium rare with melted in my mouth. It was served with an emulsion of some sort, with snails at the bottom. The snails were very soft and tasty. Don't be shy to eat snails, I promise this side will make you like them! The set menu has many dishes (1 amuse bouche, 3 entrées, 1 main and 1 desert).The restaurant offers an great atmosphere with an intimate ambiance. There were only approximately 6 tables, so you should reserve in advance. The kitchen is also open. The service was great too.Bottom line, I understand why this restaurant has a Michelin star.

Whilst we were off to a great start with their impressive appetisers, mains were a tad disappointing. There was nothing spectacular about their al granchio and it was served up with a crab claw. I may be demanding on this but I did not foresee getting my hands dirty trying to peel the meat off the crab in a fancy Italian restaurant. Snapper was fresh with a delectable capsicum sauce but it is not something I would specially head back to a restaurant for. Their service staff were friendly but I expected more attention to details.

TiramisuThe burrata was fresh and the bf really enjoyed eating it with the parma ham but I wasn't too impressed. I enjoyed the burrata at La Latteria (basically across the street) much more. The baked cod was very disappointed. It wasn't fresh and barely tasted like fish! The Etna was definitely worth it! It came with parma ham and chunks of QUALITY mozzarella cheese! The pizzas were rather big so I suggest ordering just one to share. Maybe include an appetizer and some wine? You'll be good to go! As for the tiramisu, you MUST, MUST order it! The desserts are all made in house and the tiramisu was simply divine! The only dish I would die and come back for! It was covered in crushed pistachios, but special pistachios that are grown only in three parts of the world: Sicily, Israel, and Iran. So worth it! So DELLICCIOUSSS!!

I've grown rather tired of poncy food in small dabs and dibs on a spartan place (unless it's truly meant to be that way - and what does that even mean?), and I want very much to feel satisfied and happy at the end of a meal.it was a meal of three starters and one main - and for good reason. the starters sounded more interesting and more creative than the mains (which were mostly plates of some seared meat-or-other), and were also cheaper (perhaps two or three starters were equivalent to one entree) - and they turned out that way too.we started with insalata mediterranea di verdure alla griglia, a warm salad of grilled grins topped with a light creamy cheese sauce and caramelized walnuts. I loved the sweet tender pumpkin with the crunchy nuts - and even though I usually eschew rich sauces, this was very tasty.and then the rather transcendental calamari alla griglia, or grilled squid coils with a lovely chop of garlic and herbs. delicious, plain delicious. seafood sweet and tender, these were salted just right and utterly fantastic.we had to round off the starters with some bruschette (it does, after all, take up a fair half page in the menu), and ended up with the etna, which had a slice each topped with chopped tomatoes, a grilled eggplant slice, parma ham and a slab of mozzarella. alright - but perhaps the most average dish we had. it was just a bit of toast with stuff, and not wholly inspiring (though the cheese was good).our nominal main was the day's special of salt-roasted fish, a slim specimen of a white type simply roasted with large grains of salt and served alongside a small salad. it was well cooked (and I don't mean doneness), with the flesh flaking off with a slight push - but it was also the most expensive dish at more-than-sixty for a slip of a fish, and not quite worth it considering what we had got as starters.it's definite that we had to finish with something sweet, and this time we had two. a tiramisu al pistacchio di bronte was a green layered rich concoction, with a very mild pistachio flavor - but at least it wasn't too sweet. a delizia al ciccolato was less interesting, and not flowy so much as moist - but it came with some delicious pistachio ice cream.I haven't mentioned service, and it was pretty good: just friendly enough without being unobtrusive, and they knew how to handle the crowds and seat people efficiently. price are very reasonable for the quality of food, though that statement holds truer for everything but the mains - and I'll be back to give some of their lauded pizzas a go."

This time around, however, it was the food that was great and the service was decent but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were nice and polite, but I didn't feel I could chat or really talk to them, which is fine, but a more casual approach would be nice. That being said, the restaurant does look a lot classier than the one in East Coast, so I guess they're catering to a different crowd who doesn't talk to service stuff much. Who knows. I had the Penne Arrabiatta ($18), which was just spicy enough and the pasta was cooked just nice in the traditional Italian al dente way. Too many places here sell out and overcook their pasta because that's what most locals prefer, so I like places like Etna and Modesto's who stick to their guns and serve it how it should be served. I also tried the Bruschetta ($8.50), which was really yummy. Bruschetta seems so simple but it's so easy to go wrong with it; Etna got it just right. I can't recall the name of the wine, but the red house pour was really good and went perfectly with the meal. By the time I was done with this, there was no room in my belly for desert, so I gave that a miss. Either way, the pasta and wine is ACE. :)"

I have been here 5-6 times (always for lunch) and am never dissappointed.  The weekday set lunch menu is a good bargain.  The small dining room is simple (maybe a little on the dull side) but tasteful with white table cloths and cloth napkins.  I wish they could knock out the wall between the two rooms to make it a larger more interesting dining area. The wood fired pizza oven is at the rear of the dining room in full view.  Highly recommend Etna for both food and the attentive service.

We had been there a couple of times but our best meal was when the Italian chef/owner was in the house :) She came out host us personally, taking our orders and making recommendations of dishes that weren't on the menu. Basically, anything she felt like making... and we loved it! I especially enjoyed the Pan fried mozzarella! It wasn't too salty/oily like the one I had at Ristorante Pietrasanta (that one was BAD. avoid at all cost.) After the meal, the chef treated us to some wonderful rosolio liqueur that she personally brought back from the motherland. There were so many flavors & they all came in beautifully colored bottles (so pretty I wanted to keep them all). Don't underestimate the rosolio liqueurs! They may come in a small shot glass but they sure pack a punch! Think of them as mini tequila shots with a much nicer taste (some fruity, others nutty). The food 1. Calamari (grilled) - Ok. I prefer my squids fried. 2. Pan fried mozzarella - LOVE IT!!!3. Prawns - LOVE IT!!! It was so fresh, sweet and juicy. Served steamed (the best way to preserve the natural sweetness of its meat). 4. Crispy pitta-like bread (with a selection of dips) - LOVE IT!!! Despite their house bread not making the cut, their pitta-like bread won me over. I could snack on these babies all day. 5. Spagetti vongole - Good. 6. Spagetti with crab meat (tomato base) - Good. Popular dish here. Almost every table orders it. They are very generous with the crab meat and rich tomato sauce. 7. Steak - Good. Soft & tender. Served with a good sauce as well. Small portion though. 8. Pistácio tiramisu cake - LOVE IT. I love Pistácio flavored desserts (most of the time) as it gives any dish a little nutty kick to it. 9. Lava cake - Good. The service: ExcellentThe ambianceYou'll feel like you are dining in your Italian's friend's dining room. All the decoration (plates with drawings on them) are from Italy. The owners have brought a piece of their Italian culture/heritage to share :)"

And it really never disappoints.I really like the starters and the mains that I have tried so far but I am not a fan of their desserts so I would give that a miss the next time I eat here. The burrata was great. Fresh and absolutely yummy. The etna pizza was absolutely the best pizza I had last year- great crust and crazily tasty toppings- super duper yummy mushrooms, ham and cheese. Apparently there were pistachios in the pizza but I really don't recall tasting that. The spaghetti with mullet roe was great too. And I have also tried the fettuccini with truffle cream that was also really good. I would totally recommend those dishes.  And very importantly, their portions were perfect. Not huge amounts but they will definitely leave you full. That is crucial in my books!As for desserts, I have tried their pistachio tiramisu (not spectacular) and the chocolate lava cake (the lava did not ooze out. it was just kind of hard, not at all molten as you would expect a lava cake to be). They were both not as great as their starters and mains.Their special wine pairing event that took place late last year was also really good. Most of the wines went well with the food and I was well happy with the food and drinks.Love the cosy feeling of this restaurant with its homely decor and non-pretentious and good service.

To maximize the variety, we ordered different items from the 3-course lunch($25) menu. The unique Russian black rye bread served with velvety butter that resembled mini billiard balls were signs of a good meal ahead.The first appetizer was Kharcho, a spicy Georgian lamb soup filled with rice grains and chunks of lamb. I usually do not expect much spiciness from western food but this soup had quite a robust peppery flavorThe 2nd appetizer was a classic Russian bite, Pelmeni (cold dumplings stuffed with mixed meat fillings). The unleavened dough skin made with just flour and water was indeed thick and chewy. However, the overall taste surpassed its dull presentation as the filling had a pleasant savoury taste without any strange odour.I thought the portion of the main course-Blinis with creamy chicken filling was only sufficient for kids. But unexpectedly, these traditional Russian pancakes had a sweet allure that matched perfectly with the savoury mushroom dip. The sauce was so delicious that we requested for moreThe Buckwheat kasha with Mushroom and Onion surprised us with its fine grainy texture. It tasted like a healthier version of fried rice as it is less greasy but yet extremely aromatic. Kasha generally means buckwheat but it can include cereal, mill, wheat,barley and oats.There was only one option for the dessert-Milk Kissel, a mixed of milk and raspberry jelly. Though this was not fanciful western-style plated dessert, I like its gloopy texture and the fact that it was not too rich or sweet.Fortunately, the restaurant agreed to change one of the set dessert to a dessert platter without any additional charge. Though the Milk Kissel made its appearance again, there were new faces such as the Napolean (vanilla Millefeuille with fresh berries) and the Honey Cake. Both were excellent in their own arena; especially the Honey Cake which is more similar to a crunchy Baklava than a cake. Conclusion: The $25-lunch menu may vary with the $35-dinner menu but the quality and portion of the food are similar. This was my first try at Russian cuisine, thus I had no previous reference to compare with. But we enjoyed the meal as it is easy to get used to the taste of Russian food (no particular exotique ingredients like bear paws, etc...). I would definitely return to try not the dinner, but the lunch deals at SGW, especially when there are more interesting cuisine worth trying."

Considering that their non-vegetarian mains hover around $30, this is good value--for set lunch there are three choices for mains and starters, with one vegetarian choice in each. I appreciate that they take care of their vegetarian customers, although the comment that the cabbage soup was only there for vegetarians was not very confidence-inspiring.I liked the borscht a lot more than my Olivier salad. It's kind of hard to like something that reminds me of frozen vegetables, but perhaps I just don't know Russian food. The borscht was a beautiful red, tangy, and nutty if you swirled in some sour cream. My friend's mushroom kasha had the mushrooms cut small; buckwheat is nutty, though this one had a funny aftertaste. Much improved by the addition of stroganoff gravy. For some reason I thought stroganoff was supposed to be tomato-based; in any case, plenty of beef slices, couldn't find the mushrooms. And this might be the only time I will complain that there wasn't enough mashed potato! We both paid the supplement for medovik, or honey-cake. I expected it to be like gingerbread or spice cake but this was a dry layer cake. The dessert blinis the next table had looked much more promising. Given that someone didn't have to go back to the office, my friend wanted to have a bit of vodka with his meal--something that he had had while traveling was out of stock but the waitstaff were able to recommend something similar. I was super impressed by their depth of knowledge and their passion for the vodka. I think Buyan will be an occasional curiosity for me--you won't see me back soon, until they change the set lunch menu, perhaps!"

The last time I had Russian food was prolly about 15 years ago at this cosy restaurant in Rail Mall, with a really nice owner and really commendable Russian food, but the poor chap was prolly ahead of culinary times and it shut down not long after. Since then I've had the odd borscht and dollop of caviar and blinis here and there, but not sat down to an entire Russian meal.Food : We ordered the kamchatka crab timbale with blinis which was pretty good, as was the organic quail egg done sunny side up with karat caviar. I really liked the crimean black tomato with cheese stuffing ... never had it before but it had an unusual flavor that I really took to. We followed that up with the pan seared duck magret which was also pretty yum (but then I'm partial to duck) and the halibut which was a bit on the bland and boring side. In the spirit of being all Russian purist, we went with the baba romovaya, this sponge cake dessert which was a nice end to the meal but nothing mindblowing.Ambience : All fancy with opulent chandeliers and whatnot. Bit chilly but they provide pashminas for guests so I thought that was a nice touch.Service : Well like I said, they provide pashminas for guests who are feeling the chill from the air conditioning, so that has to count for something. Generally pleasant and attentive, so no complaints there.I guess since this is the only Russian place I know, it'd be a good novelty meal type place when in the mood for something different."

LIB serves up a dinner menu as well,  and whilst I have heard great things about quality of food,  I have not been able to savour their delectable treats yet.

I did however,  have the pleasure of ending up there on Saturday night for a few drinks with friends. Once dinner time is over,  LIB bursts to life in the later part of the evenings where djs take centre stage,  and Singapore's finest talents,  sometimes guests from overseas,  control the dance floor with their signature sounds. LIB is a great place to unwind,  let your hair down, have a drink or three,  hell maybe even five,  and dance your troubles away.  There's ample seating as well if you want to rest your weary legs. They have themed nights with a wide variety of musical genres on offer depending on the day of the week. Their impartial attitude towards music is very appealing to me as a DJ. I give it 4 stars,  of course to be updated in future once I've given their food menu a try,  but their skilled bartenders and extensive selection of drinks,  along with the fantastic atmosphere and general feel of the place are worthy of a positive review. Watch out Duxton Hill,  Life is indeed Beautiful."

In fact, Life is Beautiful was the only rather empty restaurant/bar on the whole street. Despite it's cute name, maybe it's not as popular as the other places. It ended up filling up closer to 10:30pm though. The ambiance is nice and I like the variety if seating options. A glance at the haphazard drink menu left me uninterested and with a glass of water for the rest of the night. My friends didn't think the wine was very good either, so ehhh, come for the food if you must. We tried a variety of food items including the ribs, fried chicken, salad and gator meat balls. The food was surprisingly delicious and made up for my lack of interest in the drinks (I guess). They definitely have some interesting food options, and I'd highly recommend the ribs. The service was ok, although my water glass was frequently empty which I didn't like. Duxton hill is a unique little area, with a variety if other food and drink establishments around, definitely worth checking out :)"

Located at the far end of Duxton Road sits Yokowa. An intimate Japanese restaurant that opened in Nov 2016. First impressions: it's a very intimate restaurant which each section separated by blinds. Claustrophobics, don't worry. The ceiling is high, ensuring that despite being draped in, there's still a good sense of speciousness. There isn't an overload of food choices here. What they do specialize in is Kaiseki. However, if you're not sure about spending $118++ on your first visit, than give their $38++ bento meals a try (it's supposedly a lunch Benton but it is available for dinner too). Each set comes with a Miso soup, 6 side dishes and Okowa (steam Japanese glutinous rice), the pride of Yokowa. Both sets come with 3 similar side dishes (pickled vegetable, tamago yaki and braised summer vegetables). MATSU SETThe pickled vegetable were very good. I'm not usually a fan, but the ones here were not over powering the sour. It was just enough to help whet the appetite for the other dishes. Agedashi TofuThe tofu was so soft it felt like it would have melted in the mouth. Another great starter to have.Tamago YakiI was please tot surprised that the eggs were not sweet. They were perfectly cooked, giving off a nice bouncy snap with every bite and the flavors were perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better tasting Tamago. Grilled Cod This was yum. Grilled to absolute perfection, the cod had that smokiness on the outside and that juicy tenderness on the inside. I really enjoyed how they seasoned each dish minimally, ensuring that each item could be tasted the way it should be. Braised Summer Vegetables This was a surprising dish. It's served called, with the vegetable very lightly stewed (I would almost say a light poach). Plotted and carrots still had their crunch but it was the light, sweet braising liquid that really helped bring the dish together. Grilled Chicken. The chicken was very very tasty. Unfortunately, it was my fault taking my time to get to it as it had already dried out a fair bit (silly me left it till the very end). But despite being cold, dry and a little hard, the flavours were still very very good. Again, minimal seasoning to allow you to taste the chicken. OkawaOne taste of the rice and it felt like heaven. Perfectly steamed, the glutinous rice was sticky yet not overly starchy. It was very fragrant, very tasty and the Edamame and Ginko helped add an earthy umami-ness to the dish. I can see why this is their signature dish. TAKE SETBraised Eggplant. Oh my.... what has this place done to me?I've never been a fan of Eggplants and by never I mean detest it with all by life. There's something about the slimy, squishy texture that I really hate but.... I don't know what form of sorcery they used to cook it here but.... I really really liked it! Liked it so much in fact that the wife (who doesn't like Eggplant too) and I ended up fighting for the last piece. Fried breaded Salmon I know... what?!! Breaded Salmon?!?! But this was so perfectly done. The panko was so thin that it didn't take away anything from the salmon. It was lightly salted, ensuring that you don't lose any of the salmon's natural flavour. Stir Fried Beef The highlight of this bento, guaranteed. The beef slices had fantastic fat to meat ratio, ensuring that each bite gives you a little spring before it melts in your mouth. The sauce it came in was mind blowing, tasting like a very rich, stew like broth with its mixture of saltiness and sweetness. For $15+ we decided to ""upgrade"" our meal with a plate of sashimi and boy did it not disappoint. Every slice of fish was so fresh. The blue fin tuna had zero of the powdery texture and melts in your mouth. The salmon belly (or more like salmon fat) was so sinfully good and the Hamachi was heavenly. Firm when u bite down, nearly melting in your mouth after you bite and as the flavours mellow, you get this wonderful, fresh sweetness that lingers in your mouth Vanilla custard Pudding with fresh fruits What a way to finish up a dinner. For an additional $5+, you get a little bowl of vanilla custard pudding with fresh fruits. The Pudding was very light, very fragrant and wobbled with each touch. The acidity from the oranges, kiwis and strawberries helped break the sweetness a little, cleansing your pallet at the same time. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. The decor could be a little better, with the panels of our ceiling lamp missing. Dinner was a little on the pricier range but we were more than willing to pay for the freshness and the service."

I tried to call to make a reservation and realized that they don't take reservations at all. Still it is good to call then u know if they have available tables and potentially avoid being disappointed with a long wait. When I called the manager, informed me that there were 2 available tables for 2. Upon arrival, there was already a couple before us, And the place was packed! There are only 3 dishes on the menu and prices are at $58++ each! Yikes! Inflation ah?! The earlier reviews stated they were $48++ before! Dishes include: 1. Whole lobster with herb and butter sauce (steamed or grilled), accompanied with fries and salad2. Lobster roll, fries (with garlic aioli), and salad3. Chilli lobster with mantou We chose to have the steamed lobster and the infamous lobster roll. The service was awesome, prompt and very professional. When the waiter learnt that we were sharing, he proactively informed us that he will tell the chef to cut the portions into 2. How thoughtful!The lobster roll meal was good but it's not great! The lobster meat that was sandwiched between a fried butter bun was thick and juicy. However, The seafood mayo used to coat the lobster meat seemed to mask the taste the true taste of the lobster. Also if you are like me where you are sharing the actual whole lobster with another person, you will begin to notice that there is a stark difference in the amount of lobster on the roll compared with the actual lobster. I am sorry if you price every dish the same and even print on your menu that every dish gives me the whole lobster, you better make me believe it. The steamed lobster was awesome though! Because it's steamed, you get to enjoy the taste of the fresh, succulent, juicy and sweet taste of the lobster. It's literally steamed to perfection, the meat was tender and you are able to pick the flesh out easily. Definitely 2 thumbs up! Just one thing to note, if you are not big on salt, do ask the waiter to inform the chef to reduce the salt on your fries or give you unsalted fries. Mine was drowned with salt this evening, which left me rather disappointed. Another must-try are their cocktails and mocktails. A lot of time, thought and effort have been placed into perfecting the taste of each one. What I like is that they use fresh juices and not some canned juice or cordial. Definitely worth the investment! Overall, we did have a good experience this evening but I won't be back in a long while. It's really too expensive!! Would I recommend this place? I agree with the other reviewers here, I would say it's ok to go if you are like me, ie, never eaten a whole lobster before. After that, it's really up to you and your wallet."

They clearly focus on their strengths, since everything was heavily lobster-based. I got the least lobster-centric dish, the lobster roll. Lots of creamy lobster.So maybe I'm a bit of a d!ck for judging a place called ""Pince and Pints"" for having too much lobster, but one of the reasons I was so agreeable about trying the place was the promise of the ""pints"". Disappointing. They had exactly one beer on tap, and it was one that I wouldn't ever order. They had a few passable bottles.

The tapas portions are generally small so 1-for-1 tapas Monday is really a great deal with a larger portion at the same price! *note: 1-for-1 tapas deal applies to the same tapas dish ordered and excludes cold cuts. The seafood hot tapas are generally flavorful except for the Octopus. There's something about the Octopus seasoning/gravy that just doesn't sit well with our palette. The scallops are a must-order in my opinion. To end off, throw in a serving of churros, served warm (and crispy), with a rich bittersweet chocolate sauce - heavenly!Seats may be hard to get as it gets later in the evening so do head down early to get a nice table."

We ordered white and red sangria ($10) which did not taste too strongly of brandy, and was tasty because of an adequate amount of fruit juice and sugar. It was sweet, and tasted a bit like fruit punch with alcohol. Their wine comes from vending machines, and you can choose if you want a tasting portion, half a cup or a whole cup. They also serve a wide range of Tapas. The menu is divided into four parts: Cold Tapas ($6-19), Jamon & Chorizo ($8-25), Hot Tapas ($8-18) and desserts ($6-8). As we were there for a late night drink , we didn't try the Tapas. Would certainly pop by another day to give it a shot as the description on the menu makes the food sound glorious."

The gambas pil pil (prawns in olive oil and garlic) was also pretty tasty and the embutidos mixtos, a selection of Spanish ham, sausages, and cheese was a huge hit. The patatas aioli (fried potatoes with garlic mayonnaise) was deliciously addictive though the pork with saffron was a tad on the tough side.Ambience : A great vibe for drinks and tapas ... love the decor and overall ambience.

People aside, Sabio is a great place to get your Sangria or the ever popular Leffe Blonde beer on tap for a very reasonable price of $8 a glass. When you're first seated, a small complimentary portion of tapas is given to you to give you a taste of things to come if you do decide to try the tapas. I only ever had one tapas dish there that was really expensive, it was the shaved Aged Corn-fed Black Iberian Pork. I can tell you for sure the complex name justifies the fantastic flavor!

A pint of Hoegaarden goes for $12, and you'll be hard pressed to find a bar in the area which serves beer at a cheaper price. Their specialty though has to be their sangria - they serve both white and red versions, with the former being especially refreshing to drink when Singapore's weather is being muggy and difficult. Sabio has a latin feel, often playing irresistible Spanish songs which leave your feet tapping unconsciously. The decor is tastefully done up with black and white wall paper. I've even brought friends from overseas there and have them remarked that the bar makes them feel like they are in Miami!One drawback about Sabio however has to be their seats. The outdoor seats are nothing more than stools, and the front half of the bar is given over to strange semi-booth like tables which force you to position yourself in an awkward spot if you wish to talk to a friend face to face. That being said though, the vibe and cheap drinks more than make up for these minor inconveniences"

That shouldn't let that put you off though, cause after numerous visits the food has always been spot on and well executed. Nothing can be more satisfying than 50g of iberico de bellota shaved off the bone in front of you while you sit at the bar. The bacalao is quite simply the best I've had in Singapore. Staff are knowledgeable about product, which is exactly what you'll need if your not familiar with Spanish tapas concepts or items.  This place wont burn a whole in your pocket either, great Spanish tapas, In a very European inspired fit out, all in the easy central location of Duxton Hill.

Why not. There are plenty of seats by the walls that have power outlets. Wifi isn't too bad for emails and low-bandwidth tasks. The place has a nice ambiance. The design and setting of the place is conducive to work. They play jazz music in the restaurant and the hosts are very polite. Coffee is not bad, but not amazing. I wouldn't come here for the coffee, but I would come back to work here. I ordered the kimchi panini for lunch. The side salad just had normal thousand island dressing (some you would get at a cafeteria). The panini was not bad. Kimchi was good, but it was a bit cold. I think this is how you are supposed to eat it. I wish they also had some chicken or something because it's just cheese, sauce, kimchi on bread. The dish is a bit messy, I used a bunch of napkins, gave up on using my hands to eat and just used knife and fork.

I first popped by when they were less than a month old and bought myself a salted caramel ice latte. The drink was good but service was terrible, so I never went back again until recently when I was craving a sweet hot drink. There really isn't much to say. The drinks are very sweet which meant that it worked well if you like starbucks frappuccinos. The hot chocolate, ironically touted as the 'best hot chocolate or your money will be refunded', was absolutely terrible. The image is deceivingly large; it's a shot of intense chocolate. The chocolate itself wasn't bad but the viscosity of the drink reminded me of when is first tried to make hot chocolate with equal parts milk and chocolate. It was topped off with generous whipped cream (sort of like bicerin but without coffee and much thicker), which I tried a little of and then decided it wasn't worth the calories. I've never tried the food (the high price point for simple sandwiches really puts me off), so perhaps it'd be worth it after all. The service is...lackluster. It appears to be run by two Korean girls, one of whom takes orders at the counter and always appears unhappy at customers. Everything takes ages from waiting to order to waiting for the food and there's no real service involved apart from preparation of food and drinks. Given that a simple lunch can easily cost above $20 here, I wouldn't recommend this place over all the other great eateries with better service available in a the area at the same cost."
