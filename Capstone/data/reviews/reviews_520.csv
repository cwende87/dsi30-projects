Chinatown Cheng Kee Hokkien Mee,"335 Smith St #09, Chinatown Food Street Singapore 050335 Singapore ",050335,1.2822749605271,103.843238518071,[],Victor L.,69xsJFjiOAd8Ld7WWk_tEw,"Toronto, Canada",3,2/3/2017,"This place is in the tourist area of Chinatown.  Obviously, it is more expensive than other hawker markets.  The meal was just ok and there were so many stalls to choose from. The plus is that they made it fresh but it took around 10 min before I got my meal.  People who ordered the other items got their meal quicker.  The environment is not too special as you are sharing tables like a food court.  It is more cleaner than the typical hawker market but they are everywhere, there are cleaners to wipe down the table.  I likely would go to other places nearby to try to local cuisine. After my meal, I passed by the 1 star michelin restaurant that I heard of on TV programs.  It may be busier on other times since when I went, it was in the middle of Chinese New Year."

Hidden amidst old shops along Temple Street, this independent cafe may seem a little incongruous, but the charming interior and A/C provides a cool respite from the rest of Chinatown. On our visit we had the Mango Beer (Can, $9.50) imported from Taiwan and an Americano ($3.50). The Mango beer tasted like fizzy fruit juice, and the only hint of the alcohol is a slight hops taste at the end. Great for those with a sweet tooth. We also had the wings ($6.50), which, according to our server, comes with ""home-made mustard sauce""! The left side of the cafe is lined with notebooks, bags, etc that gives the cafe a real Taiwanese cafe feel. At 5pm on a weekday it was pretty empty, but several tables were booked for 7pm. So call and make reservations if you're heading there for dinner!"

Make sure you know how large the crab will be, because I did not know, and it made a big dent on our final tab. We ordered the White Pepper Crab and the Chili Crab. It was my first time with the White Pepper Crab, and I enjoyed that more than the Chili Crab. The Chili Crab here has more of a mala taste to the chili. I also liked dipping the mantou into the White Pepper Crab more. We also got the clams and some veggies. All very tasty and done well. They offer gloves and utensils. Get a coconut as a drink. Our crabs came out to be around 1.5kg. So our check was over $300. One crab is plenty for 3 people, even 4, but we went all out."

It's all about the signature dish here. You can get the classic dish, Singapore Chili Crab, which we did. The also have their own variations. The Green Mumbo was suggested and I must say it's sauce was the best, even better than the classic. Our service was excellent. Explanations and suggestions were generous. One note of caution: pricing. You pay per 100 grams of crab, live weight. The crab is not weighed before you so you don't really know what you are in for as far as the total bill. You are told the crabs range to 1KG and up. At our night, the Green Mumbo was 1.5kg, so 150 Singaporean dollars, or about $120US. But you don't have to get a crab each. If you are just wanting to try the best of Singapore, one crab per table of 4, with plenty of fry bread and other accompaniment should be fine. I strongly recommend the pork belly bits. I know. Shoot me for ordering pork at a seafood restaurant."

I thought it would be a very unique experience, however, it tasted just like a normal curry crab. The crab price is also similar to other top places for seafood. The crab meat was also mediocre, nothing extraordinary nothing bad. The noodles were also mediocre. Strong flavors but nothing special. Clams were average. The vegatable was the best tasting dish of the night and very fresh."

If you're tired of the regular chilli, black pepper, white pepper, salted egg yolk crabs and want to taste a crab for its pure, natural flavour, than Happy Crab should automatically be your #1 choice. I'm giving this place a 5* rating, solely  based on its crabs. Seasoned with just salt and pepper, these crabs are first cooked lightly, then thrown on a charcoal grill to give it that charred BBQ flavour. Mixed in with the natural sweetness, it makes for a killer combination! Ranging from around $35-$40 a crab, these delightful crustaceans will take away whatever craving you have for a good crab because well... They are that good!!Your first bite will bring Michael Buble's ""It's a beautiful day"" floating into your head, and you'd be clapping along to Pharrell William's ""Happy"" halfway through your dinner. The only sad thing about eating here is when you realize that... You're out of crabs! Apart from the crab, the Fried fish is pretty good too and it's sambal is delightful, but... Everything aside, this place definitely THE place to be fore grilled crabs. 2 pincers up for some awesome crabs!"

Not just any rice, Sambal Rice. It's a little spicy so be forewarned.The ambience is nothing to shout about. Kind of looks like your typical Singaporean hole in the wall, but then again that's how you know the food is good.

This place is one of a kind.First off. Grilled crabs. They're grilled till good and charred with salt and pepper. There's a real respect for the natural sweetness of fresh crab, and the combination of flavours won over someone who isn't even that big a fan of crabs. I ate an entire crab by myself. That should tell you something.We also had the best grilled squid I've ever had in Singapore. Grilled with lemon juice, and a little salt and pepper, the squid was tender and delicious. I could have polished off the whole plate by myself, but alas, I had to share.We also had deep-fried ""sand knife"" fish. I believe locally they're also called ""ikan pasir"". Now, as ridiculous as this sounds, I'm not that big a fan of seafood. But these fish. Deep fried. They were meaty, crisp, not oily or fishy in the least. I ate mine, and a third of my friend's. We also had sambal fried rice (excellent wok hei flavour, but not enough sambal), sambal kangkong (wasn't that big a fan of the sambal), and a traditional Teochew dish of cooked leeks with tau kua. The highlight of the meal was what came next. A whole parrot fish, stuffed with fresh chili, wrapped in a banana leaf, and steamed. I think I ate half the entire fish all on my own. I'm a big fan of the clean, fresh heat of chili padi, and the spiciness, combined with the firm, meaty fish was excellent. It wasn't in the least bit fishy, and I found the heat just right to provide that little tingle on the palate, while not overwhelming the flavour of the fish. All in all, I had an excellent meal, and I cannot wait to go back. I'm even bringing my mum, because she's the seafood lover in the family."

The dish came with a chicken wing, a dried fish (mackerel?), an egg, one piece of cucumber, some sambal sauce, and a heap load of rice. The chicken wing tasted old and was not thoroughly cooked. I could not taste the coconut milk and pandan leaf with the rice, as one should with nasi lemak. Overall, a sad meal that was only made slightly better washed down by the Milo Dino drink.

They do not serve beer but one can sit at the Italian restaurant next door for beer and get served food from Tabouleh...

I was expecting to be a little disappointed, but was surprised when it was almost as good as the Lebanese food my family makes. I had a kofta wrap and thought it was delicious - the meat was juicy and flavorful. I had asked for tzatziki on the side instead of hummus, since that's how I usually eat kofta, but was just given yogurt and oil together, without cucumber mixed in. Regardless, it was still a decent side dip and was great with the wrap. My friends shared a cheese manakish, which was decent. I thought it could have had a little more flavor, and prefer thinner dough, but this was still good and reminded me of ones I eat while at home. Overall this is a great place to try if you're looking for Lebanese food!"

Most recently, however, I tried their shish tawouk and was so let down with their portion size. I did get takeaway, so perhaps not indicative of presentation and serving style while dining in, but I received incredibly soggy fries, some smothered in mayo, with a super tiny wrap smushed on top to fit in the otherwise already tiny container. $10 for this was definitely overpriced.The hummus is still always highly regarded, so I will still come back for my tabbouleh desires and try another appetizer when the craving calls."

I had to walk to the back to get the server's attention to take our orders and get our bill.For starters we ordered hummus with some bread on the side; this turned out pretty decently. The hummus portion was generous and we were able to take it home with us.I ordered a chicken shawarma, and my mom, the beef. Portion-wise it was puny, and I found my chicken a bit dry.

Everything tastes good. We prefer Lebanese hummus because it's smooth and creamy.  It's a great value for what you get -- pita comes for free when you order hummus and other appetizer dips so that saves money. I *think* prices are inclusive of GST and service because whenever I get the bill I'm pleasantly surprised.  There aren't so many exotic decorations, and it's fairly simple setting. They stick to good food served fresh: warm dolmas, freshly made pizza-like with lamb, good hummus, etc. You could pay more to get a Middle Eastern ambience with carpets or tiles or fancy decorations, but if you're more interested in getting good solid food with good service at decent prices, this is the place to go."

I grew up eating pho in Canada (both Toronto and Vancouver) where you just cannot miss the numerous pho restaurants dotting the cities. So my standard of good pho is what you get from any pho place in North America. There is just no bad pho over there and it is a staple food in every Vietnamese family there. First off, the chairs are most uncomfortable. The stools are too high for me to eat off the table easily, I felt I was bending over double just to eat, and I am a short person. Then the combination of air conditioning and fan going gives two types of temperature. You get the cool air followed by a blast of warm air, it is most disconcerting. I ordered the sliced beef and brisket pho with extra beef balls. The soup is tasty though I wish it also comes with a side plate of bean sprouts and basil and slice chili and lime for customer to add to it. The meat is terrible. I cannot see or taste the brisket at all, and the meat is very chewy and tough. Such a big disappointment. The beef ball is good though I cannot tell if it is handmade or from a machine. The summer tea takes some getting used to. I will suggest to stick to the Vietnamese coffee or something. The service is good though. Bring cash. I do not remember if it accept NETS. Definitely no credit card facility here. At the moment, I think Pho Tam Anh at Chinatown Point is better for pho."

Service is efficient but they were quite confused with our orders as we constantly placed new orders instead of placing one at one go. I guess they're more used to people who show up to eat and leave, and not us grazing types.The fresh roll is not my favorite but I quite liked the meatballs. They're nice and juicy and come with a delicious dipping sauce. But enough distractions, let me talk about the crab noodles. Unlike pho, they come with mee tai mak which is a kind of short rice noodle and is super slippery and look like little tails. As a result, you have to scoop them up with a spoon, inhaling all that delicious broth along the way. The soup is like a super jazzed up version of pho broth, with all the added umami delightfulness of crab and seafood. The bowl is generously topped with crab & pork meatballs as well as some shrimp. I literally inhaled the entire bowl in one go and had barely anything left for my companions who wanted to try it. Oops.I would go back again just for my favorite crab noodles. I've also tried the bun and pho which are good but ... pale in comparison to those crabby, savory, delicious noodles."

Hailing from Melbourne, with a massive Vietnamese population (and having had two Vietnamese ex-girlfriends!), my judgements of Vietnamese food are always benchmarked against what I've had back home.Which means I'm usually disappointed here in Singapore. We ordered pho special (dac biet), Vietnamese ""Assam laksa"", some goi cuon (fresh rice paper rolls), and a couple of drinks. The goi cuon was good, fresh, with a great sauce. Pho was good - probably best I've had so far in SG - but still not ""Melbourne good"". Of course, it was a damn sight better than the ridiculously overhyped, overrated and overpriced NamNam. It was missing the depth and ""roundness"" of flavour that I love about pho. Generous with meats, though I missed the bits of Vietnamese sausage, tripe and beef tendons that I've come to expect. The Assam laksa was a bit unusual, complex flavours, I wasn't a fan.  Service was good, friendly and fast. $30 for two of us. Tables are literally 4-6 inches apart from each other, so not the most pleasant ambience. Overall worth a try. I just hope people stop going to NamNam."

But people were leaving and we got a table very quickly. Food order is easy - write your own order sheet which is available on the table and then proceed to the counter to place them. Very soon after, our pho arrived. Though I would have preferred to have our starter of papaya salad come first, it came a bit later. We ordered the simple beef pho $7.90, my personal benchmark of a good pho. To be really honest, there was hardly any beefy aroma when the bowl hit the table. Taste wise, brothwas rather mild as well. I am used to a stronger beefy broth and would have liked more than the couple of token mint leaves and herbs to add more aromatics. Oh well. A squirt of hoisin and hot sauce and a squeeze of calamansi lime were added in an attempt to lift up the taste. Better but still short of what is good. Nonetheless I do appreciate this more than Nam Nam's version (which I feel uses lots of artificial seasonings). The papaya salad was very good though! Just papaya, a few shrimps and a good dressing and topping of shredded pork, fried onions and crushed peanuts. $6.50The table for two pax is rather small, given that all the condiments are provided (which is a good thing and convenient) but do take up a bit of space. Our 2 bowls of noodles, 2 drinks and 1 appetizer took up every area."

I've never been disappointed by their bowl, but it's always good to have a backup in case they are closed or when i'm not near the East. So here is another trusted alternative- Mrs Pho. Mrs Pho has been on my food list for a bit because it has been recommended by trusted foodie friends like Miss Tam Chiak and Superfinefeline. So after several half baked attempts to visit (despite being in the area), Jr and i finally dropped by for a taste test.   Standard side order of Goi Cuon ($3.50 for 2). Thin and chewy rice paper rolls filled with rice vermicelli, slices of prawn and pork belly, paired with that 'chee cheong fun' sauce.Now on to the star, their Pho! Have the Pho Bo Tai ($7.90) Sliced Beef Noodle Soup or the Pho Dac Biet ($8.90)- Special Beef Combination Noodle Soup. The former is a no frills bowl that comes with thin and tender beef slices, while the latter has meatballs, brisket, beef, and a half cooked egg. I thought the beef balls were very authentic and indeed they are freshly shipped from Vietnam weekly! As compared to Long Phung, we think that Mrs Pho does a more delicate bowl of noodles with milder flavors. Of course, you can always spice it up with the accompanying fish sauce, lime, and chili. If you are not for beef, there's also Pho Ga ($7.90) Chicken Noodle Soup, and Bun Mam ($8.90) Assam Seafood Noodle Soup. and other vermicelli and rice dishes. Start or end your meal at Mrs Pho with the Iced Ca Phe Sua Da ($3). I thought it was rather smooth and not too sweet really! The Avocado Smoothie ($4.50) was decent too. Now i know where to head to for a perk me up in the Bugis area! A good Ca Phe Sua Da is so hard to come by in Singapore. And of course, the pho. Come here if you can't take Joo Chiat's grittiness, Mrs Pho is definitely more for the young hipsters."

I was greeted with the sound of people slurping their pho and distinctive Vietnamese chatter from the staff....great start....additionally it was 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was packed!Although the pho appears to be the must try, I was craving a rice plate so I went with the Com Suon Cha. Before I even get to the food, I just want to say that I was surprised to see how reasonably priced the items were. Nothing over $8, and the bowls of Pho I see coming out of the kitchen all looked huge. Anyway on to my food, The pork , eggs and the Vietnamese ham combo all blended in real well. Portion was just the right size, you won't come out overly full. I also opted for a fresh spring roll appetizer. I'll have you check out the pictures for yourselves.It was real authentic and took me back to Vietnam and San Jose hahaha. My only complaint....I wish the would add more items as I'm sure Mrs. pho would make them so well!Apart from the food, I liked the decor of the restaurant, very rustic and modern, in keeping with the interior design of most places around Haji lane. I'll definitely come back here and review the Pho!"

A year ago, I would've given it 4 stars, but the standard has dropped. The beef pho, pho ga and bun are just OK (sometimes, the pho broth is tasteless) but it's still better than the overhyped: Nam Nam.Some things never change and those are the starters/sides. The chicken wings, beef balls and fried spring rolls are pretty good and I LURVE the cockles (they say it's fried in garlic but really, it's half a piglet of lard). The fresh spring rolls are hit and miss.  This place can VERY crowded during dinner. Best to go before 7pm. After 8pm, many items might be sold out. Eating there isn't the most comfortable. Chairs are too high for the table so your back will hurt if you linger. And they have this annoying habit of forcing 2 people to sit at two-top even when the restaurant's not crowded. Tables are SMALL. With the sauces, cutlery, pho bowls, side dishes and drinks, you practically need to sit at another table to eat. But hey, rules are rules. Cash only. No booze on the menu but I've seen the owners break out some Tiger around closing!"

It try to emulate street eating in an air-conditioned environment. We do see Vietnamese eating there so it may be more authentic than the other Vietnamese chain stores in the city."

It was also when the staff was eating their lunch made by the kitchen. You know food is good when their own staff eats there. Pho were $7.90 to $8.90 in price and the portions are great.

Also the flavor increased as the steak cooked into the broth. My friend had the spicy beef soup, something I didn't try it but he seemed quite happy. My other friend had the beef noodle stir fry which I did taste and I think it is the best Vietnamese stir fry I have had, which is quite high praise as I would never consider ordering something besides pho at a Vietnamese place until now.

A tip is to ask for extra lashings of basil and mint, essential in making it all come alive.4) Bun Bo Hue ($7.90): a hot and spicy beef noodle soup laden with stewed beef that was so-so, and a fantastic Vietnamese ham5) Bun Bo Xao Sa ($7.90) - chilled rice noodles tossed in a peanut-onion dressing, and topped with beef slices stir-fried with lemongrass: must-try and the best thing here, with its clean and clear and crisp flavours"

The waitresses and waiters are not very experienced but they are very friendly and helpful. We love the beef pho, fresh and fried spring rolls, my sister and her hubby told us the chicken pho and spring roll vermicelli are great too. I think the pork chop rice, chicken wings and meatballs are quite average but my nieces loves them. They also have the best avocado and coconut smoothies.

It took 20 minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited. The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2. The place was packed and the seating was minimal. They were obviously overbooked and unprepared. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. The drink I received from the mixologist was the only bright spot.

Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline.

The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of ""room"", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, ""divided"" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the ""Shakespeare in the Park""-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally ""mixing it up"" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!"

What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the ""heart"" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story ""hidden"" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is."

Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and  Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Crème Brûlée. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves! Bespoke cocktails are priced at $18, and infusion shots at $10."

We nabbed a cozy spot next to the door, with sofas and our back to the wall panelling. It was a pretty interesting place as we had the privilege of looking at the types of people walking in the door. My keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table, and immediately started charging my phone.Coffee was excellent while the Lady Lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations. They have other cake selections on display as well but the selection/names didn't catch my attention.The staff/service is highly commendable. Even though we were seated near the door, the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu.Would definitely be back here again!Tips:- Our seat had 2 socket plugs so internet/phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone- Don't sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke.- If you prefer a cooler, air-conditioned experience, it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe."

Perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of Maison Ikkoku seems to still remain. They do coffee, cocktails and food. The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table. If they would up the service a little bit I would change the rating to a four without a doubt."

It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

The scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that I am going for that combination from here on. The multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat, which was lovely. The guacamole is too awesome for words. I'm not a fan of guacamole but boy did I wipe out all of it this time around.I had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant. The last time I remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at Bowery Street, New York. Desserts is a must.

The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi?

Besides the good food, the coffee here is exceptional. The staff do their best and it's situated in a wonderful area in Singapore, full of culture and atmosphere. Right across the cafe is the Malay Heritage Centre which has a sprawling garden serenely situated within this district. Taking a stroll within the compound after your coffee break at Maison Ikkoku is as simple as walking across. Worth coming here during a lazy afternoon. Just note that weekends are extremely crowded during brunch time and most seats are usually taken up---they take reservations as well but call early!Oh, my recommendation: try their own in-store-crafted Tiramisu cake --- it's delectable and delightful!"

It took 20 minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited. The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2. The place was packed and the seating was minimal. They were obviously overbooked and unprepared. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.

It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of ""room"", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, ""divided"" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the ""Shakespeare in the Park""-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally ""mixing it up"" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!"

What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the ""heart"" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story ""hidden"" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is."

Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and  Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Crème Brûlée. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves!

My keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table, and immediately started charging my phone.Coffee was excellent while the Lady Lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations. They have other cake selections on display as well but the selection/names didn't catch my attention.The staff/service is highly commendable. Even though we were seated near the door, the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu.Would definitely be back here again!Tips:- Our seat had 2 socket plugs so internet/phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone- Don't sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke.- If you prefer a cooler, air-conditioned experience, it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe."

Perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of Maison Ikkoku seems to still remain. They do coffee, cocktails and food. The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table. If they would up the service a little bit I would change the rating to a four without a doubt."

It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

I had the Smoked Salmon Scrambled and the portion was huge enough for 2 to share (well we wanted to share cause we needed to save space for the desserts). The scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that I am going for that combination from here on. The multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat, which was lovely. The guacamole is too awesome for words. I'm not a fan of guacamole but boy did I wipe out all of it this time around.I had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant. The last time I remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at Bowery Street, New York. Desserts is a must. This time around, we went for the rainbow cake (last slice btw!) and it was so good. Not too sweet that it turns you off. It seemed like a mix between a carrot cake and a cheese cake.

However, we were quite lucky - there's still a table for two that's only reserved for 1pm. Since we weren't planning on chatting or taking our sweet time there, we promised we would be in and out before then.I immediately zero-ed in on the Smoked Salmon Omelette ($18), mainly for the chunky guac side, while my sister got Croque Madame ($15)I was pleasantly surprised by the portion. The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi?

What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the ""heart"" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story ""hidden"" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is."

The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of ""room"", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, ""divided"" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the ""Shakespeare in the Park""-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally ""mixing it up"" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!"

Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and  Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Crème Brûlée. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves!

The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table.

Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word ""omakase""), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's  some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned."

The food served is really good and the coffee... oh man that is just the finishing touch on a good brunch. I had the Smoked Salmon Scrambled and the portion was huge enough for 2 to share (well we wanted to share cause we needed to save space for the desserts). The scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that I am going for that combination from here on. The multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat, which was lovely. The guacamole is too awesome for words. I'm not a fan of guacamole but boy did I wipe out all of it this time around.I had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant. The last time I remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at Bowery Street, New York. Desserts is a must. This time around, we went for the rainbow cake (last slice btw!) and it was so good. Not too sweet that it turns you off. It seemed like a mix between a carrot cake and a cheese cake. This place is really good and a must go!"

However, we were quite lucky - there's still a table for two that's only reserved for 1pm. Since we weren't planning on chatting or taking our sweet time there, we promised we would be in and out before then.I immediately zero-ed in on the Smoked Salmon Omelette ($18), mainly for the chunky guac side, while my sister got Croque Madame ($15)I was pleasantly surprised by the portion. The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi?

I could taste the pumpkin though the cheese and the nutty crust. Brilliant! It was however a little too heavy for me towards the end. Well, that's partially my fault for being too greedy anyway.

The drinks are amazing. I think they have a menu - but I always just tell the waiter what I feel like having, ""Something not too sweet, refreshing and strong"", and they'll whip up something for you. Makes it kinda exciting.Their drinks are visually orgasmic - with very elaborate designs, and very artistic interpretations of the traditional cocktail.I had like 8-10 drinks there last Friday, and had a blast.

Enough skill to be worthy of 5*. I'm docking one for high prices and their inability to keep up service quality when the place is full. And somewhat because the location is annoying to get to, as well as being quite nice. None of these (except lack of scalability) is worthy of a star by itself but they add up.The coffee is very, very good. In fact I used to trek there to get my beans because they get the roast amongst the most ""right"" of all the roasters in Singapore. It's a light roast of single origins with very nutty tones (think Colombian) which is perfect for long drinks. Price is in line with hipster coffee places at 7 for a cold drip.The food is best defined as quality tiny portions at exorbitant prices. 18++ for a bit of cheese and 6 crackers is ridiculous! But it's a hip place, the customer base is probably trying to keep under their calorie limits... I try to eat before going there even though it's pretty good stuff. The cocktails are precise and well balanced. What I wonder is how much of that is bartender skill and how much is recipes and good quality control? Nothing wrong with the latter but the prices seem to be marked up to levels implying the former. If Ah Sam can offer bespoke cocktails AND chuck 3 attempts down the drain before offering you something they're happy with, for only 23++, the more than 30 charged by Ikkoku is a bit ridiculous. It's also worth noting that you take a risk by letting them go wild, occasionally you get a dud (our berry mojito was not that different from a dragonfruit flavour vitaminwater) - but that's part of the game. No risk no gain. I do wonder what the ice is made of. The smell of the water from the melting ice definitely reminded me of MacRitchie reservoir. Again, at that price point I'd expect using something other than tap water in delicately balanced cocktails (or at least filter it). What annoyed me is that I once asked for a variation on a classic cocktail (instead of sticking with giving them a mood and getting something ""created"") and they made a bit of a fuss about it, implying I didn't trust them or something. On the contrary, a true artist works best within constraints (cf what Helmut Newton's ""victims"" said of sessions with him, which were dictatorial). A classic sour, for example, is all about balancing the sour, sweet and booze taste-wise and texturally, the egg white (which they did impeccably). A sazerac is the hardest of all as too much absinthe results in basically an aniseed short drink, and too little and you have something resembling an Old Fashioned. The location is alright, sandwiched between shophouses and with a magnificent view from the garden over the Sultan Mosque which has just been renovated. Bit far from public transport by foot.On a normal (i.e. not full) day, the prices are somewhat justified by the competent and personalized service and peaceful interior. Then we made the mistake of coming on the Chillax anniversary night where something like 500 Amex card holders poured onto a small number of bars to test the resilience and scalability of the teams on duty that night. Once we got there and somehow secured a table, the team cranked up the music to painful levels (to stop people lingering and clear space for more of the mobs?) so much so that we on outside tables kept closing the door to try and preserve our eardrums. It then took them 10 minutes to take our order and around 1h10 to deliver the cocktails. This is the downside of hand crafting every order, scalability is almost impossible. We moved on to Auld Alliance which had no issue with the Chillax crowds, thanks to having both ample amounts of staff at hand and serving whisky instead of cocktails, which take less effort to serve. If Chillax had been my only experience of Ikkoku, I'd never come back.The thing is, at this price point, I don't bother going to Ikkoku anymore anyway. Sure it's good, but the stack of small risks and issues just make it hard to find the willpower to make the effort, particularly if the night will be crowded. There's plenty of competition in town..."

They have a great ambience and your tables are made out of old recycled doors or cupboard doors. Old shelves are also nailed to the celing, giving a vey odd impression that they are falling through the ceiling somehow!The coffee here is fantastic. I always order the latte, or the MI Signature latte. They use a fragrant blend of beans that I can enjoy without sugar. For those who aren't crazy about coffee, you can also order the chai tea, which I find good, but a little too sweet for my palate.The cakes here are also worth mentioning. My favourites were the pumpkin cheese cake, which was light and not too heavy, and the red velvet cake topped with cream cheese icing, walnuts and comes in a gloriously large slice.They have great sandwiches here at affordable rates. I found them so big, a friend and I could share one. They use good, freshly baked bread, and quality ingredients for their sandwiches.I've also tried the eggs benedict on their weekend brunch menu, and enjoyed it. I will definitely head back to try their other coffees and dishes!It's mostly street parking around here, so good luck at peak hours! This area is also notorious for the summons people loitering about and giving tickets, so it's best not to risk an illegal park.

Usually watery, tepid, and bitter. Mostly, I got comfortable with the kopi houses all over singapore for my caffeine fix. It's a very different kind of drink, but once you get used to it, I found it to be a better option than the other coffee available.Anyway, back to Maison Ikkuku. This is the place I visit on the weekend, when I want to have a real coffee. Fresh ground beans, well roasted, and made properly with a decent espresso machine operated by people that know what they're doing. Best coffee I've had in Singapore.

I enjoy telling them one or two key ingredients or taste, let them mix a cocktail, and be surprised. Of course, you can always try their more popular drinks. The bloody mary is one of the best in town. So are the smoked whiskey & chili drinks. The service is great. Everyone is cheerful and friendly. The vibe is uplifting, cosy for a group of friends to hang out or catch up. My only pet peeve is no reservations after 9.30pm but I do understand their point of view.

For the first time in Singapore, I had a version of spam musubi with REAL SPAM...at $3, it was a bit overpriced for its small size, but it satisfied my craving (the few places that sold musubi used generic spam). My caramel latte was much better than I expected...not too sweet but the coffee was strong and flavorful -- definitely not your average brucnh latte. Our friends ordered a side of potatoes and it was a lot smaller than we expected -- it came in the same sauce-like container the guacamole came in...it made the musubi for $3 look like a good deal haha.

It took 20 minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited. The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2.

Get Welly to pour you a signature MI Latte - he's pretty good. Heck, even the chef's a bit of a barista himself! Oh and the food's pretty good too. Try the weekend brunches. Or grab a musubi if you're in a hurry (spam on sushi rice? yeah.)Second level houses a menswear boutique. Cult brands, decent selection. I've been making eyes at some Miansai accessories for ages... picked up some Twins for Peace shoes instead. #firstworldproblemsTop floor is a boutique cocktail bar. Now if you remember a mixologist called Leslie who used to be at another bar a couple streets away... I found him. He's a smooth operator, and he's got a wealth of experience.

It's probably the only place of its kind in that enclave. I was looking for a good coffee boost but didn't want to have turkish coffee so my friend brought me to this place, it's along the row of shophouses just opposite the malay heritage centre. It's got a very welcoming cozy vibe - the kind that invites you to just hang out here for hours. I ordered an iced latte (loved how it was served in a generous portion of a jar!) and had a red velvet. Indeed I got the coffee boost I wanted and more! The coffee was beautifully prepared, with alot of love. The red velvet was a nice accompaniment though it was quite a huge slice that I couldn't finish it.Haven't been to the other floors of this place but definitely have become enough of a fan of the cafe to check the rest of the place out!Final verdict: A good break from middle eastern food and atmosphere of arab st!"

On a quiet side street, the calm of a quiet Saturday afternoon is broken by the hum of conversation and the hiss of milk being steamed under pressure. The painted brick walls with industrial style copper pipes and light fixtures are far removed from the original shophouse that was here, and are closer to a contemporary urban studio apartment. There are some quirky touches also, with old pieces of furniture suspended from the walls, and doors recycled into tables on an outdoor terrace.An espresso shot is the foundation of many different coffees. It's hard to make a bad drink with a good espresso, and so much easier to make a bad drink with an over extracted shot. The espresso shot that I ordered arrived with a medium dark brown crema, and a small volume of coffee. (The crema colour is an indicator of freshness. If it's pale, it's stale, which is why I always make a note of this. The small volume suggests that the shot was not over extracted, which would give rise to unpleasant flavours in the shot, as non soluble coffee grounds end up in the cup). It was bitter, with hints of woody flavours, and a slightly thick mouthfeel. The aftertaste was bold and lasting - overall a well executed espresso. So far, so good. I ordered a latte also. The espresso was definitely muted by the milk. It was smooth, with the coffee flavour not lost or drowned out by the milk. However, the overall quality is reduced by the presence of larger bubbles in the milk foam - this is something that I have seen before in Maison Ikkoku. This might seem like the most minor and insignificant point imaginable, but there are valid underlying reasons for pointing this out. Larger bubbles do not impart the same silky smooth mouthfeel that microfoam does. Also, the baristas have gone to the effort of creating latte art. Unfortunately, larger bubbles cause the foam to break apart, so the overall affect is lost after a few minutes. This is something that is fixable, and it's a shame to see their efforts go to waste for the sake of a small change to the steaming technique. It's also the difference between a very good latte, and an average one. One thing to bear in mind however - the point above is simply not relevant for anyone who prefers drip or brewed coffee, and might not even be an issue for anyone else.  There is also a good selection of brewed and drip coffees available for anyone with different tastes. Pourover coffees are on the menu, along with cold dripped, syphon, aeropress, andV60 all available as options. Coffee choices include pretty much everything except ristretto shots. That's ok though, there's more than enough on offer. One thing that Maison Ikkoku does well is the pairing of different bean types to different brewing methods, and the baristas are well versed in which method to pair to which bean. This is great to see, and speaks volumes about the cafe, and the owners intentions and reasons for starting. Prices as are expected - $8.50 for the latte and cappuccino above - and broadly in line with what is charged in other quality cafes. Along with Smitten and Chye Seng Huat Hardware, Maison Ikkoku has a very well stocked retail section, with accessories that are not always found elsewhere. There is a good selection of items for brewed or filtered coffees, including Chemex and V60 coffee drippers, cone filters and syphons. There are also tampers on sale for home baristas. Unfortunately, Maison Ikkoku does not sell coffee beans. This is something that I would like to see happen, as there are some interesting blends and single origins  from Columbia and El Salvador being used. Overall, 4 stars, as the selection of brewing methods available, and the quality of espresso, makes up for the steaming issue described above (which will not affect everyone), but it's unfortunate to see this when everything else is done so well. Also, Maison Ikkoku can be very crowded at weekends, with queues for seats - opening the second floor cocktail bar during the day would help to alleviate this. It's certainly worth a visit, and along with Symmetry and EspressoLab, is a good choice for anyone craving caffeine in the Arab Street area."

Boutique - Great Japanese brands, mostly for men.  Bought a few things, decent options and easy to chat with staff.  Great way kill time while waiting for a table.  Bar - Friendly (and skilled) bartender, tasty tasty drinks. 2nd favorite cocktail bar in Singapore (Tippling Club reigns as #1, no surprise there).  The bad: Cafe - Food has taken a nosedive since opening. Change in chef/recipe?  Something is off, because before it was the best eggs benedict and now it's just average. Tiramisu is to die for, literally.  Gave me and my friend a stomach ache. Always crowded, so be prepared to wait.Boutique - Would love more options/sizes. Bar - A bit too congested and pricey. Need cheap/beer options.  Haven't been in awhile, I hope they added a free/self serve water option because it wasn't there before.  The ugly: If the drop in food quality is any indication, this could be one of those great venues that gets popular and forgets about the little things that made it so. I'm optimistic though because it seems that the staff actually cares."

Its one of those, don't have a menu but tell me what you want type of speakeasy-ish bars. while the decor isn't that of a speakeasy - the drinks are the classy types that reminds you of one. Try to go early on a random week day to get a seat at the bar, so you can see the amount of care and skill that goes into each drink. I love watching the mixologist (okay, NOT just ""bartenders"", but this is some classy stuff - so ""mixologists"" it is) going at it with each drink, pounding away on the berries/cucumbers for super fresh flavors, slapping the mint (NOT just ripping it up like how ppl usually do, but SLAPPING it), and lighting up rosemary on fire for extra flavoring and a show. drinks are amazing here - the only time i've had to have something re-done was for Maison's version of a bloody mary, it wasn't that it was bad, but it was just too spicy. overall - i always have a great time here, chill vibe, classy music and decor, and most importantly, each drink makes me feel so special.

It almost had a nutty flavor. I'm guessing it's the way they roast the beans.  They also are hitting on the trend of offering a ton of different coffee preparation styles: French press, vacuum, whatever.  C's coffee was superb.  The only downside to this fabulous little eatery is that we felt bad holding the table so we quickly sipped our coffee and skedaddled.  I'm totally going back next weekend."

We had the jumbo prawn mee with soup, no bean sprouts.  The soup was tasty but not as flavorful as I expected, can be better.  The jumbo prawns are jumbo but somehow the prawns are also not as tasty as it can be.  But compared with other prawn noodles I have tried here so far, it is indeed the best one.  At 8.80 for a small bowl, I thought it is a bit overpriced?

Likewise, the price ranges from 3 dollars for a small portion of sliced prawn mee to 10+ for the jumbo prawn mee. Upon ordering, one can choose the spicy or non-spicy version. Personally, the spicy version is preferred as it provides a nice kick when drinking the broth at the end of the meal. The prawn and noodles were cooked nicely, no hard and overcooked prawns. But the real deal lies in the prawn broth which one can get free refills of. The broth haste a strong prawn taste fragrance that left a sweet after-taste. Do note that one will have to park further away and walk to the stall as the stall is located facing the road. Finally, the stall opens till 4pm daily, hence do expect to have it only for lunch and tea-time meals."

LOL!  Regardless....OUR MEAL WAS DELICIOUS!  Maybe because we have tastebuds for food like this because we grew up around Mexican food or the like living in Southern Nevada or maybe because this was an unexpected gem in a sea of Asian cuisine in this region of the world, but this was a great experience and a fantastic meal. We asked for their ""top selling suggestions"" from our waiter and ended up with the following at our table: 1)Tono Ceviche - an unexpected twist to what I would normally expect when I order a ceviche with baby calamari and beet root paste. 2). Mariscos - this was a savory, minimally salty, delicious rice dish with fresh seafood. 3). Salmon - raw fresh salmon with a pop of unexpected Peruvian flavor (ordered from their Daily board)4) Pisco Sour & Chilcano - two great custom cocktails!  Refreshing, light ceviches, remarkable flavors.    My husband and I shared all items in order to try everything.  Most items are priced between $25-$30SGD each and designed to share and explore (although potions not gigantic or anything).  We loved everything about this place.  Decor, design, Britto artwork, delicious unique food for Singapore.  WE CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!"

Given our love for raw fish (just look at the number of sushi and sashimi restaurants, plus the recent poke craze), i'm surprised it's taking so long for ceviche to take off! TONO Cevicheria is also Asia's first-ever Peruvian Cevicheria opened by Peruvian Chef Daniel Chavez, co-owner and chef of OLA Cocina del Mar. Expect authentic flavors and strong Pisco Sour from the team of Lima-trained Latin American chefs.If you're wondering what Peruvian food is like, well... It's kinda fusion, with influence from the Incans, Spanish, Africans, Italians, Chinese, and Japanese. We can see a mix of all flavors in their national dish, the ceviche. (I'm just making this up, there isn't a national dish but if there should be one, it has to be ceviche.) At TONO, there are a few types of ceviche to pick from. Starting with my favorite Tono Ceviche ($28). This mild but balanced dish uses an interesting tiger's milk which features charred ginger, and smoked aji amarillo (peppers) among the typical citrus-fish jus. Plus there's an added crunch from the crispy baby calamari to go with the fresh fish.If you want something to kick start your appetite, the Nikkei Ceviche ($24) is a tart Japanese style yellowfin tuna salad with a soy, mirin, hondashi tiger's milk. There's a lot of lime in this one! There is some avocado puree with the dish but i couldn't detect much of it due to the overwhelming acidity.Another Japanese inspired dish is the Yellow Pituco Tiraditos ($24). The yellowfin tuna is sliced thinly in this one (almost carpaccio style), and dressed with chilli vinaigrette and some cream sauce. The spiciness is one that will take you by surprise and give you a hacking cough (like that when you choke on ma la). The garnishes depends on chef's mood for the day and we had radishes, crispy quinoa and plantain chips on ours.Fun fact of the day. There are more than 4000 varieties of potatoes in Peru. Well we only had 1 type in the Escabeche causa ($22) which is served with 2 types of chicken (chicken shreds mixed with mayo, and grilled chicken with panca chilli sauce) served with potato mash and escabeche sauce. The piquant sauce is made with fresh peppers and aji panca (dried red peppers), garlic, tomatoes and onions, with chicken stock. The aji panca gives the dish a light smokiness.Skip the Jalea ($32), which is essentially a crispy seafood platter with tapioca chips, salsa criolla and smoked chili mayo. It's not that it's not nice, it's just that there's nothing special about it. Plus we can always get more interesting seafood elsewhere in Singapore.Same goes for the Lomo Saltado ($40), a Chinese influenced stir-fried beef with red wine vinegar and the other typical Chinese aromatics. As with their Chi-Fa (Peruvian Chinese food stalls), this is served with french fries and rice. My take? I'd have the authentic Chinese stir-fry. Anticuchos (chicken or beef, $22/25) are meat skewers which have been marinated in a mix of red wine vinegar and aji panca before being seared on a plancha. It is served with a Chalaquita sauce made with a little tomato, pepper, onions and white tiger's milk (used in ceviche clasico). The beef was more juicy than the chicken skewers. Peruvian meat dishes, actually most dishes, have varying degrees of sourness. It's appetizing at the start but sometimes you just want something heavy to anchor the meal. Thankfully we had the Arroz con Mariscos ($34) a seafood rice with crabmeat, fish, prawns, and calamari in aji panca, aji amarillo and achiote oil base. Long grain rice is used here and provides more bite. The seafood remained succulent as they areseared separately before being folded into the rice. Peruvians love their sweets and i had too many alfajores con dulce de leche when I was in Peru but these Alfajores ($12) at TONO are way better! The light butter cookies with dulce de leche and mango mousse simply disintegrates into powder when you bite into them. The dulce de leche is housemade, as is the mango mousse. Both are delightful without being cloying.More rice for desserts? Sure if it's Combinado ($12), a comforting spiced vanilla rice pudding and purple corn Mazamora. The rice pudding is made of bomba rice cooked with milk, cream, sugar, orange peel and vanilla, with coconut puree added at the very end. While the purple Maxamora syrup may look strange, it's made with Christmasy ingredients like star anise, apples, and quince, along with pineapple skin and purple corn."

The space wasn't crowded and we could enjoy lunch at a leisurely pace. The buffet was mostly focused on local cuisine.  The cold bar involves a selection of greens to build your salad plus a sampling of seafood. No sashimi but you can build a cold platter of prawns, crawfish, mussels, and clams. The warm food ranged from local faves like carrot cake and otak. Also includes a range of Chinese and Indian dishes like bok choy with goji berries and lamb curry. Carving station for roast beef as well as a made-to-order laksa station where the broth was surprisingly more lemak and tasty than it looked. Dessert included fruits and a nice selection of local nonya kuehs. Pair the sweet Kueh Dadar with coffee from the espresso machine and it's a nice way to finish the meal. Folks are friendly and attentive. Perhaps pricey at the full price but very reasonable with discounts from places like eatigo. Ginger is not a fancy buffet but more than does the trick for variety."

It's always an oasis of calm and serenity, perfect for contemplation and small talk over perfectly crafted nibbles paired with excellent Chinese teas. Of course, feel free to let your inner Chinese scholar/poet come out to play (we couldn't resist giving our best shot at some calligraphy).There are 3 Tian Fu Tea Rooms at the PARKROYAL Hotels at Beach Road, Top of UOB Plaza, and Kitchener Road, each serving slightly different versions of the high tea. During this CNY period from now till 22 Feb 2016, a special Imperial Reunion High Tea is served from 2.30pm - 6pm daily for $38/pax (usual $30/pax). During this period, diners will enjoy an individual portion of Yusheng (yes even if you dine alone), with 9 other light bites (including a rice/noodle dish). Beach Road and Top of UOB plaza serves the crunchy and refreshing Prosperity Salmon Yusheng with crispy fish skin while Kitchener Road serves a Premium Black Truffle Yusheng!Fine Chinese teas are paired with the dishes. We started with the Bai Mu Dan (White Tea) and then moved on to the Bi Tan Piao Xue (Flower Tea) with our spicier Sichuan dishes at the Beach Road outlet.I really love the Chong Qing Chicken with Spicy Bean Paste! The ma la chili really whets the appetite and packs a punch. The Chilled Sliced Duck wrapped with Salted Egg helped to balance that spiciness but honestly you don't taste much of the duck.  Some steamed dimsum bites with the chunky Sliced Prawn in Black Bean Sauce and Steamed Fish Balls with Black Moss, both of which I thought were well made but on the bland side. Somehow they were missing the fresh seafood flavor as the fish paste used in both were a little starchy.We loved the Pan-fried Glutinous Pancake with Minced Camphor Tea Smoked Duck. This was an expected savory mochi with a dark saucy minced duck filling. Behold the paper thin crispy layers of pastry! Give me more of that Deep-fried Radish Puff with Dried Scallop. I was mind blown by how that thin puff could hold all that juicy disintegrated radish. We followed the fried dishes with a Dong Ding Wu Long (Oolong Tea), which is said to cleanse our palate (not that the dishes were any oily).As much as i tried to avoid carbs, i finished every single grain of the fluffy and fragrant Fried Rice with Waxed Meat and Matsutake Mushrooms. This was amazingly good as the rice seemed more steamed than stir fried actually and had the lingering earthy scent of the lotus leaf and prized Matsutake mushrooms.I'm a new fan of fried nian gao and Tian Fu Tea Room's version in a flaky and crunchy Honey Glazed Pastry Puff was a stellar rendition of this traditional sweet. We've had way many Liu Sha Baos but this was the first super deep-fried one in a slightly mochi like skin. It was artery-cloggingly delicious but we had to drain some of the oil out of the one for fear of a heart attack while finishing this.If you're up for more traditional dimsum sort, you may want to check out the Kitchener and UOB Plaza outlets. There is the ongoing UOB card promotion- 1 dines free with 3 paying guests. Time to get your lo hei going!"

Featuring nine delicately handcrafted dim sum paired along with a glass of sparkling wine and premium Chinese brew, the afternoon tea feels very much like enjoying a classical sonata with three movements. The first part of the afternoon tea comprises the familiar meat dumplings that are elevated with the thematic prized element--bird's nest. This very much mimics the the first movement of a sonata which sets the motif and catches the audience attention with fast-paced uprising rhythm. From Xiu Mai to Xiao Long Bao, the silky dumplings were served from the steaming bamboo baskets shortly after another. One could not help but felt nervous and excited because they were best savoured piping hot while the smoke was still visible. The star ingredient didn't have much taste on its own, but it imparted light crunchy bites to the little purses of pork or chicken that dribbled meaty juices with each bite. In the spirit of the afternoon tea, tea is no less emphasized here as the team takes a judicious approach in complementing the dishes with the right tea. To refresh the palates for the subsequent courses, we sipped dainty cups of 碧潭飘雪, a type of white floral tea belonging to the Jasmine Tea family that is harvested from Si Chuan Er Mei Shan. (according to Prof Baidu). As we waltzed into the slow relaxing second movement Adagio, we encountered authentically Sichuan fare that represented the modulations of the theme. I loved the unabashedly spicy bowl of boiled minced meat dumplings that hit me with waves of mild sensational numbness. Plain as it seemed, the Sichuan noodles boasted an alluring aroma of shallot oil and went superbly with some drizzles of spicy meat dumpling broth. The grand finale pulled everything seamlessly back to the theme with a nourishing bowl of chilled pear with bird's nest. Infused with sweet melodious notes from the double boiled pear, the dessert resonated in harmony with the 云南滇红 Yunnan Red Tea, a highly prized Pu-er tea often served to foreign delegates including British Queen Elizabeth when she visited Kunming. Most certainly, a visit to Si Chuan Dou Hua would not be completed without having a bowl of its signature silky-smooth Beancurd that was still as delicious as my previous visit. Other highlights include the Steamed Crystal Bird's Nest Seafoood Dumpling and Bird's Nest with Winter Melon.

And this session at Si Chuan Dou Hua was incredibly informative and opened our mind to an amazingly elaborate world filled with deep-rooted traditions and intricate details that gave us a new found respect and appreciation for tea.Each tea was also perfectly paired with different types of delicious dim sum, and it only served to further enhance the flavors of these great dishes that we have come to love."

Surrounded by a somewhat international clientele owing to the backpackers' hostels in the area, we truly felt like we were in a tiny pocket of Singapore that wasn't.Food : The menu too, reflected the exotic and international feel of the restaurant, comprising dishes from Spain, Italy, Greece, Egypt and the Middle East. We got the melitzanes tiganites, essentially eggplant deep fried in batter, fish shish kebabs, an absolutely mouthwatering tender lamb shank with fragrant saffron rice and Moroccan chicken with couscous. Delicious!Service : Majorly understaffed. There was only one waiter serving the second floor and the food took forever to arrive. He seemed a bit flustered but to his credit, was very earnest and fairly eager to please. Definitely plenty of room for improvement though.Ambience : Lovely, cosy and comfortable.Highly recommended if one wants to avoid the heat and more ghetto feel of the open aired cafes littered around the area."

This joint is really popular mainly for its comfy carpeted floor seating and the shisha it offers. Food wise, it is your regular Middle Eastern offering stewed lamb or mutton with spice tossed rice. The one simple dish that I do enjoy and find great to share would be the pita/flat bread with various dips. Each unique dip adds a kick of flavor to the perfectly charred bread. The only set back would be the lack of staff to cope with the 2 floors so sometimes it can be quite a wait to get served. Then again with an environment like such, you seem to feel a whole lot more patient."

I wasn't expecting Kampong Glam to have any bars -- this is the Muslim quarter after all! -- much less a funky bar like this that looks like it's been transported straight out of Melbourne or Berlin. This bar is cool and hip, mildly grungy, edging on the side of hipster but not quite there (thankfully). Nearby Haji Lane and the narrow laneways around it are chock full of street art and graffiti, so I felt like I was definitely back in Melbourne.The place is in an old house (mansion?) with pretty shutters on the windows and outdoor seating in the laneway to the side of it. Inside, it's an explosion of colour and Moroccan lamps, crazy mirrors, and a faintly Middle-Eastern-on-acid vibe. Whatever, it works. There's a huge stage and often live music here. When we went, it wasn't jazz music -- I think it was more rock, but I don't actually remember because we wanted to have a conversation so we chose to sit outside.We went on a weekday night and it was PACKED. They barely managed to squeeze our group of 5 in. They weren't serving full meals, just bar snacks, and we didn't order any so I can't comment on the food. Drinks didn't seem any cheaper or more expensive than in other parts of Singapore, and they serve massive Tiger Beer towers here (our group of 5 shared one and it was plenty of beer!)Staff was super-friendly in spite of how busy the place was. There was a veritable monsoon while we were there, and staff were quick to rush out and crank up the roof cover thingie so we wouldn't get soaked.I noticed that this place was way more popular with Westerners (either tourists or expat workers, I don't know) than with local Chinese-Singaporeans or Indian-Singaporeans. I'm not sure why, but that's what I noticed.Definitely recommend checking this place out if you like the cool, hip, unpretentious types of drinking holes, especially for live music."

The restaurant was pretty empty. We were the only ones inside and there were maybe three 6 other people outside. Upon arrival, the restaurant grabbed our attention with their New Orleans jazz-inspired theme. We thought this place could get busy at night so we were happy to visit when it was calm and relaxed. It took so long for us to get help, we were treated like they didn't want us there (but they were open and they didn't have much business). The staff definitely seemed annoyed. When we eventually ordered our food, it arrived between a reasonable time to ""what's taking so long?"" The food was delicious, no doubt about that! We savored every bite. However, when it was time to pay our bill, no one wanted to help us! We sat there for a good twenty minutes waiting to pay and eventually got up to go to the waitress to pay. She left us for almost another 10 minutes before even accepting our card! We almost left because no one seemed interested in taking our money. If the food wasn't great, I would give this place two stars (the atmosphere is pretty neat, so one star for that). However, service is absolutely atrocious!"

Places always need a certain cool factor for me, & a place called Blu Jaz had a lot of cool to live up to. Few hiccups here & there, but Blu Jaz was on point.The first thing you'll notice is the loungey, laidback café feel to the place. The inside had some decent space to it, but like the others said, it really is a little run down. It could go for some sprucing, but nothing crazy.  It felt like an authentic, jazz lounge you'd drink at in Louisiana, or a hot reggae spot you'd find in the Caribbean. All in Asia - DOPE! We sat in their outside terrace, where the area is on the sidewalk - lets you be close enough to everyone moving about, without them being all up in your food. The menu has a great variety & selection, and the brunch options were good. The food tasted great, and the drinks were good too. We spent 2 hours here without even realizing it. Good vibes!ONLY compliant was the waiter got our meals wrong. When we brought it up to them, they were mad cool & chill about it, took back the wrong plates, and brought us the right ones. Blu Jaz is fun. FUN. You ever in Singapore, and looking for a place where we could have a good time with great food & drinks, this is a good ticket. As a fan of cool, I encourage you to check out this place. Just reiterate your order before your waiter leaves. Good vibes wayy up."

The first floor is where some of the best Jazz talent from around the world strut their stuff. I'm, particularly, a huge fan of the band Fuze Collective headed by vocalist Fendi Sahid. Fendi is one of the few artists based in Asia that has a voice that oozes with Soul... So rare to find in this part of the world. In fact, as good as the Jazz artists / Jazz bands we would hear from the Dirty South, USA. Fuze Collective performs on Saturday Night, so if you're free, be sure to check them out.If Jazz isn't your thing, there is a fantastic night club on the second floor. The cover charge is $10 and is well worth the price of admission. During my last visit, on a Friday night, DJ was jamming it up with Reggaeton. Who knew, they play Reggaeton in Singapore, but they do at Blu Jazz! I found myself reminiscing my college years in New York City. I give this place four stars. The music fantastic. However, the facilities are a little run-down. Additionally, there is not a lot of room for patrons to hear music on the first floor. In short, Come early! By far the best place to hear great music in Singapore."

I had been reading about this place during my vacation planning and it sounded really great, so I wanted to try it. After doing some investigation, I became enlightened and learned this place does a ""Reminisce"" night every 3rd Saturday or something. WHAT? Reminisce...in Singapore? Why not? I'll try it! I threw on the simple shorts and red lips and hailed a cab from my hotel. But, I did throw on a shirt too, but I just thought it would change the tone of this review to say I threw on a shirt. But, I just said it, so, dang. Messed it all up. Okay, moving on :/Blu Jaz is in a really convenient area. It's next to everything, including a 24 hour McDonalds about a 10 minute walk from the joint. This is important because drinking will probably take place on great music nights, so you should eat after so you won't be sick! Please, guys, eat! When I arrived, the DJ was playing MJB's, ""You remind me"". I was like, ohhhh, okay. I see ya'll. I looked for the entrance to the 2nd floor and paid the S$10 cover. No biggie.  After that song that made proud of myself for actually leaving my hotel room, it kind of went down hill. Don't get me wrong, the music was good, it was just...NOT reminisce type music. Maybe I'm just getting old, but 2012 or 2013 isn't going to make me reminisce about anything but the bills I was paying that year. I want to think about my care free days, you know, no responsibility days. I looked at my watch, it was about 11, still early, I'll give it some more time.At midnight, DJ Titus came on the scene and this dude GAVE ME LIFE!!!!!!!!! He was the best DJ I've heard since moving to Asia! He made me feel like I was in Chicago with my buddies cutting all the rugs! He dj'd for about 2hrs...maybe. Then, the original guy came back. He started playing...*gasp*...*gasp again* (because it's that serious)...REPEATS! YES, soooo early in the night. I was so confused. I didn't understand why they started repeating songs so soon. It was annoying, I left after that. However, DJ Titus was not a disappointment and I would love to go to an event when he's DJ-ing the whole night. I'm sure I would have sweat dripping down my legs creating puddles from dancing so hard! I realllllly enjoyed this dude. I will definitely return to Singapore and to blu Jaz as soon as I touch down. Great spot. Note: I did go to that 24hr McDonald's after this spot because my tequila intake was pretty serious. Okay. Go and have fun (to blu jaz, not McDonalds). :D"

I think I was expecting something like Lan Kwai Fong (LKF) in Hong Kong where people are just dancing in the streets with music blasting from every storefront.We heard Blu Jaz was a cool venue and were seated pretty promptly on what seemed to be a busy night. Ordered a few mixed drinks (gin and tonic, vodka tonic, etc) and we seriously couldn't taste any alcohol in any of our drinks. They're reasonably priced at $10-12 but I'd rather pay more for a stiffer drink.The hookah (shisha) was fun - we had the mint flavored stuff. There was a live jazz band playing indoors (we were seated right outside) so that added some great ambiance. There was also a video projection of a DJ spinning upstairs in the club that looked pretty happening. We tried to check it out but with a $10 cover at close to closing time, we decided not to waste our money.Overall a fun place for a really chill night."

Then everyone felt the same way and it got unbearable in some way or other. Blu Jaz is that place in Singapore.To be fair, the music, DJs and indie events they hold here on the second and third floors are always good fun.It's just that the bar/cafe... it's exploded, and in the process it's lost something we once loved about it. The casual and intimate vibes about this eclectically decorated place were its star attractions. Now that hundreds of people feel the same way, you can rarely get a table or hear anybody when they're talking. Service has become brusque and impersonal.No fault of theirs. It's a tricky thing to be this popular. The food, which used to be pretty acceptable at its price range (mid-range), is no longer so.I still want to love it, I still want to go every time, but I can never get a damned table. These days I just go to the better bar/restaurant *behind*, that they also own... even when Piedra Negra gets crowded, at least you can stand/sit in the streets."

The prices are mid range but worth it for the portion that you get. It gets really hard to get a table in the evenings and weekends but they usually try and find a way to accommodate you. The place is open for lunch and dinner and the one dish I like best is the Beef Lasagne. It's amazing. The sauce that's in the lasagne is so good. It's piping hot when it comes out and you will definitely be wanting more after you finish it. What else is good is the Balls of Fire and the Zing Wings. You can also have Sisha here and the price is about the same as the other places around Arab street. Overall this place is great for a casual night out with friends.

Whilst the shophouses they occupy are atmospheric and nicely done up, they've also got a sequence of unsightly tables lined up along the pavement. Not really the best seats in the house, but this is where you usually end up if you arrive later in the evening and all the other seating options have been taken up."

The bar expands up 3 floors and across to another building. On a cool weekend evening, its often hard to find a table, both outside and in. They often host themed nights such as 90's RNB which are buzzing till late.The food is mediocre unless paired with some alcohol to amplify the taste, my personal favorite are the Balls of Fire. The sheesha is quite good and reasonably priced with a selection of flavors to boot. Drinks are also reasonably priced and there is something for everyone.The facilities are weirdly located almost inside the kitchen but are kept relatively clean.

It's well hidden in a place people seldom go or walk past! A friend of mine walked passed it a few weeks back and we decided to give it a go. Anyways this review is strictly about their teppanyaki menu only as we did not try anything else!I've been on the search to find reasonably priced but GOOD teppanyaki for the longest time.Anyways we went there on a Sunday evening at around 6-7pm. There isn't that many people. They do sell other types of Japanese food like Sushi, Sashimi, Chirashi etc.. but I was craving Teppanyaki so we decided to go for the Sets.The teppanyaki comes either as alacarte or sets. They have a few sets to choose from like Wagyu Beef Set, Normal Beef, Chicken, Seafood & if im not wrong, lobster. I decided to try the Chicken since i was feeling a bit sick of beef at the moment. My friend however did order the beef and I tried it. The beef was well cooked and really soft! The sets come with miso soup, salmon, veg, rice and desserts like ice cream.From experience, many Teppanyaki places Ive been to normally have almost all the food taste really similar coz they seem to use the same sauce for everything! This was not the case down here. It had a kind of a bit more ""homely"" taste. It costs about 60 - 80bucks per person for the teppanyaki sets, depending on which one you go for.I still don't think it's really worth the price coz the food was so-so. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't that good either. For $70 a head... I'm definitely not looking for so-so."

As few would know the existence of the restaurant, until someone bring you here.First, I would like to comment on their hand roll. Please go for California hand roll. It is my top favourite food in the restaurant. Crispy seaweed wrap around the fresh crabmeat. You can even hear the crack of the seaweed when you eat it.

It's close enough from the main area with all the hookah bars and restaurants, but because it's surrounded by shops that close early, people think that part of Haji Lane is dead.

This place is truly magical in every important aspect you would want a chilled out cafe bar to be. Plus it has a whole spiritual element to it that makes it so unique and different to any other place i've ever been to. Great people all over this bar... not just working there, but the regulars that go to visit the place. The decor of the space is colorful unique and important. They play lovely world chillout music. So if you want to relax, take it easy, try something different... have a chakra lassi at Going Om. They serve them in 7 different colours as alcoholic or non - alcoholic beverages.They have an incredible goddess by the name of Tian who plays soothing feel good music with a ukulele on thursday nights. A charming unbeatable cafe on haji lane with infectiously enjoyable parties."

The whole vibe is super chilled out and borderline hippie-ish, but a rastafari feel is prevalent as well. Think lots of plants, pretty lights and helpful but laid back service staff.My favourite place to sit is outside because it's great for people watching. They set up tables along the street (like most places in the district do) and you've got your choice of spots if you go early enough. What really adds to the laid back feel of Om is that there is no menu. This also ensures that the staff are knowledgeable enough to know everything on the menu, their prices and their discounts. And the prices are pretty cheap too: Beer (Asahi, Heinken, usual beer options) Liquor (Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum, Whiskey) + mixed (free)Cocktails ($12 onwards)Shisha ($25) If you head upstairs, and you'll have to take your shoes off, there's a cosy little attic which is really good for functions. Spread yourselves out on the floor amidst carpets and cushions, and order plenty of drinks - a bucket of beer is $40 which is great for a group or that one alcoholic friend we all have. Definitely one of the coolest places in Arab Street simply because it doesn't try."

Apart from the typical shisha custom mixes such as Apple-Mint, Grape etc, they have a surprise in store for you. If you ask the staff nicely, they whip up a mean ""Vodka-infused"" shisha. Their shisha is smooth on the throat, and is one of the best I've had in Singapore. Ofcourse, comparing it to the shisha joints in Egypt will not be a fair comparison. Don't bother requesting for a menu, just ask the staff to recommend something for you. Their fried oyster mushroom nibblets were pretty good, and so are their wedges. They offer both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages too."

In the day, it is a calm and peaceful oasis where lush, tropical plants and exotic eastern meditation music welcome weary shoppers seeking respite from the heat. Crystal healing, yoga classes, intuitive card readings and free meditation sessions are some of the unusual additional services offered here.At night, the place is transformed and the atmosphere is almost carnival. People from all walks of life converge here. There are live acoustic performances every night, and a roving magician makes an appearance to entertain and befuddle guests on Thursdays. A real treat is when the Starlight Alchemy movement artists make their weekly appearances. They perform with enchanting lights along the entire length and breadth of the narrow little street, delighting all the customers seated along the street. There is a large variety of flavoured tobacco for shisha, and you can request for custom mixes. However, I have not seen their innovative Watermelon Shisha anywhere else in Singapore. There is no menu here. While the usual western-styled food and bar snacks are available, the owners at Going Om also whip up their own original creations, so expect new dishes every time you head down. The staples fresh salads with homemade dressings and homemade desserts, such as the ""Strawberry Surprise"" and the ""Apple & Pear Crumble"", are popular dishes here.The Going Om Chakra drinks are also a must try here. The seven flavours correspond with the seven chakra or energy points in our bodies. They have both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions."

I've been to restaurants where the brick oven pizza is so fresh that it hurts to hold it in my hand (ie: Alt Pizza at Suntec). For a party of 2 on a Friday night, the bill came out to just over $60 including 10% service charge and GST.

We had chosen to dine at cicheti because she wanted to satisfy her craving of having squid ink pasta and google proved aforementioned restaurant to have one of the better squid ink dishes. Our family got the pulpo and burratina to share as appetizers. The pulpo was way too salty and over cooked - it was really tough. The burratina was 'weak,' for lack of a better word - it was hardly even creamy and more watery than anything. As our mains, we got 2 seafood stews (which tasted decent), a Bismark pizza and the tonnareli nero. My mom complained that the pizza was way overpriced since it came with such basic ingredients. And for the pasta, it was too salty for my sister's liking. She returned it back to the kitchen and the chefs willingly cooked up another portion for her - but it still came out salty the 2nd time around. Maybe the water used to boil the pasta was way over salted? Maybe the pasta itself was made too salty in the kitchen because it's supposedly homemade? I don't know...The kitchen kindly gave us a complimentary dessert (chocolate cake) to make up for all the problems so that was nice of them. But overall, it wasn't a very satisfying meal. We wouldn't come back."

Period. This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore, as told by many before me. They have a wood-fired oven that makes the pizza really authentic and just so fresh. Everything we've ordered was excellent. I'm a huge fan of those places where their integrity in food shows through from the bread they serve on the side -- they were so well-baked to be crips on the surface and textured just right on the inside. I've had the prawns (4/5) for appetizer -- again very fresh and loved the bread on the side. (good food just don't require much words.) Carbonara pizza (5/5)--excellent, excellent, excellent. I definitely would agree that pizzas are Cicheti's greatest strength. Despite the misconception that carbonara is some creamy, alfredo-like saucy anything, this was an authentic carbonara creation with egg in the middle with caramelized onion that complemented the rich pizza so well. Gnocchi (3/5) on the other hand, was a bit dull. It was good, but not to the standard that was shown through with pizza and the appetizer. I really liked the ricotta bits that were dropped on gnocchi but that was about it. Nothing spectacular. Panna cotta (5/5) -- THE best I've had in Singapore. Generous portion of really well-made panna cottaChocolate fondant (2/5) -- disappointing. Just overly sweet without much sophistication. Would not recommend. Service was okay. I've been told that I wouldn't be able to grab a seat as a walk-in that easily. So I did make the reservation. However, they really need to work on the speed. I am not talking about the slowness in general (as I do understand that good food can take some time) but the interval at which they brought us our food just left us in a very awkward eating & stopping cycle that did not create a good meal experience.All in all, pizza was super impressive and I loved the restaurant. Will definitely be back."

As bufala mozzarella is a soft cheese, it did make the pizza slightly watery, but the tomato sauce and chewy, slightly charred crust made up for it. Not sure if I was just hungry or if it was just THAT good, but I was able to eat the entire pizza myself. I noticed other people were splitting their pies, haha."

Cicheti is located near Arab Street and parking can be a challenge.Since we were driving, arrived early to find parking on the street. Bought parking passes at 7-11. There is a covered parking over at Landmark Hotel if you cannot find parking on the street. The restaurant is a rustic but sophisticated dining room that has both upstairs and downstairs seating. Enjoyed dining downstairs much better since that's where all the cooking and action takes place. Plus it had a cool vibe to it. Music was cool as well...kind of a Buddha Bar Euro sound.Uncomfortable Seating alert! I am kind of a skinny minnie (it's ""all about the bass"" they say) so I don't have a bass for the stool I sat on. It hurt my rear really bad. Bring a pillow to sit on if you are here more than an hour. Service was terrific. Our waiter was really welcoming and very helpful. Our water glasses were always full. To start, ordered the pumpkin salad. It was excellent. Pumpkin was perfectly seared and greens were fresh, fresh, fresh!Next was the spaghetti with New Zealand clams. Sad to say, that dish was a thumbs down. Clams were just too sandy. Would never order this dish again.Of course, the star of the show, and the reason we were here, was the wood fire pizza. .

We absolutely loved the caramelized onions that formed part of the topping and we soacked up all the egg yolk with our leftover crust. Perfection! We were sad that the pizzas got cold after awhile. We shared the salted chocolate cake for dessert. Fantastic choice!! I am a big fan of molten lava cakes in general and this one did not disappoint. The portion is quite big - perfect for 2 ladies to share. The melted chocolate oozed out once we dug in. There was just the right amount of salt added to boost the flavor, and the generous scoop of vanilla gelato accompanied with crumbles complemented it perfectly. Heaven in a mouthful! Only gripe is that the kitchen is small so once the place hits capacity service can potentially get slow. Hopefully they have more help for peak hours."

My finger hovered over the mouse clicker for what felt like an eternity before I clicked on four. I may yet change my mind... nah, probably not. Gotta be tough sometimes, know what I'm sayin'?Anyway, the food and potential of this place is straight up five stars. The pizza is fantastic, and most probably my new favourite pizza in Singapore beating out previous faves Extra Virgin and Limoncello. The pasta also is simply wonderful: proper al dente, hand-made especially for the restaurant (according to front-of-house) with a delicately put-together sauce (the pappardelle ragu in this case) and no scrimping on quality ingredients.Moreover the price point is really quite brilliant. Approx. $70 for two pastas and a pizza. I'm not saying it's a steal but given the trend of skyrocketing prices these days, it's pretty damn great. The pizzas themselves are under $20 which is already cheaper than the two previous favourites I mentioned.What let this place down are some details. Firstly, the pizza came out incredibly quickly and was lukewarm. I suspect it was prepared earlier for another patron. The fact that I still rate it so highly is a testament to its overall quality but the misstep still deserves mention.The other letdown was the service. It wasn't terrible. Front of house (a European chap) served us the entire time. He was affable and fairly attentive. But i walked in at 8pm hoping to secure a table and was told that none were available until 9pm. I saw several free, assumed they were booked, agreed to come back for 9 and requested a call should any table free up earlier.My request was rebuffed. I was told that the restaurant was ""short-staffed"" and that front of house simply did not have time to check his reservations. This is not good enough. Staff your restaurant properly. When I returned at ten to nine, sure enough, the same tables that were available earlier were still empty. Something tells me no one ever ended up taking them and I could have well eaten earlier. This lack of attention and care for your customer is disappointing.The moral of this story: book ahead at Cicheti and accept some arrogance - the place is clearly buzzy right now. But the quality of the food is well worth turning a blind eye to the flaws."

Gnocchi (3/5) on the other hand, was a bit dull. It was good, but not to the standard that was shown through with pizza and the appetizer. I really liked the ricotta bits that were dropped on gnocchi but that was about it. Nothing spectacular. Panna cotta (5/5) -- THE best I've had in Singapore.

Once you enter, you're transported into some (fancy) hole in the wall Italian spot with some legit offerings.I had the margherita bufala, and after looking at all the Yelp photos post-meal, I realised it's a very popular choice! As bufala mozzarella is a soft cheese, it did make the pizza slightly watery, but the tomato sauce and chewy, slightly charred crust made up for it. Not sure if I was just hungry or if it was just THAT good, but I was able to eat the entire pizza myself. I noticed other people were splitting their pies, haha."

Unfortunately, this doesn't cut it as a 5 stars only because of the wait/reservation system. As one other reviewer noted, even when making a reservation, they basically say you have to be out of the restaurant by a certain time and make it a point to re-emphasize the fact while you're there.

I am not talking about the slowness in general (as I do understand that good food can take some time) but the interval at which they brought us our food just left us in a very awkward eating & stopping cycle that did not create a good meal experience.All in all, pizza was super impressive and I loved the restaurant. Will definitely be back."

I noticed that they have a traditional woodfire oven but we didn't order any of the pizza. Instead, we ordered their daily specials, vongole and roasted veal. The vongoles was nicely cooked with white wine and garlic (not spaghetti), fresh and fragrant. And the veal was perfectly cooked at medium rare paired with Brussels sprouts and bacon. My friend and I love this dish. Price wise, the final bill was $80. Not really cheap but considered the food quality and the good service, worth it. Next time, I will try their pasta and pizza."

Once you enter, you're transported into some (fancy) hole in the wall Italian spot with some legit offerings.I had the margherita bufala, and after looking at all the Yelp photos post-meal, I realised it's a very popular choice! As bufala mozzarella is a soft cheese, it did make the pizza slightly watery, but the tomato sauce and chewy, slightly charred crust made up for it. Not sure if I was just hungry or if it was just THAT good, but I was able to eat the entire pizza myself. I noticed other people were splitting their pies, haha."

Unfortunately, this doesn't cut it as a 5 stars only because of the wait/reservation system.

This is my second visit.  Last visit left a very good impression, esp. the pizza so we decided to venture back for some good crust which is such a rarity on this island before heading to the Projector for some german films.  We had the burratina and the bismark and they were as good as I remember - the burratina was fresh, and I'm not just talking about the cheese but the arugula as well which is such a pleasant surprise.  There were too many times when I had not-so-fresh salads here.  The other thing I find restaurants tend to do here is being too generous with the dressing or perhaps it's reflective of local preference but I definitely prefer my salad fresh and with just a tinge of olive oil and/or vinegar, which Cicheti has executed perfectly.  The figs were delightful as i love the fruit and adds some interesting texture and flavor.  Now the pizza came fresh from the oven and I still love the crust - right thickness, right amount of chewiness.  I will definitely recommend this place if you are looking for some authentic pizza.The place seems quite busy and we were lucky getting a seat walking in.  We sat at the patio, which I didn't know about.  It's a fairly small area with three small high tables but quite atmospheric sitting in the open air and munching the dough while listening to the call to prayer.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Also just a stone-throw from all the action around hajilane or if you like movies, the projector across beach road.  Perfect starting point to a good night out."

BUT better make a reservation if you want to eat here because it is very popular! Could not get same day reservations for Thursday but secured a reservation for a Saturday night. Cicheti is located near Arab Street and parking can be a challenge.Since we were driving, arrived early to find parking on the street. Bought parking passes at 7-11. There is a covered parking over at Landmark Hotel if you cannot find parking on the street. The restaurant is a rustic but sophisticated dining room that has both upstairs and downstairs seating. Enjoyed dining downstairs much better since that's where all the cooking and action takes place. Plus it had a cool vibe to it. Music was cool as well...kind of a Buddha Bar Euro sound.Uncomfortable Seating alert! I am kind of a skinny minnie (it's ""all about the bass"" they say) so I don't have a bass for the stool I sat on. It hurt my rear really bad. Bring a pillow to sit on if you are here more than an hour. Service was terrific. Our waiter was really welcoming and very helpful. Our water glasses were always full. To start, ordered the pumpkin salad. It was excellent. Pumpkin was perfectly seared and greens were fresh, fresh, fresh!Next was the spaghetti with New Zealand clams. Sad to say, that dish was a thumbs down. Clams were just too sandy. Would never order this dish again.Of course, the star of the show, and the reason we were here, was the wood fire pizza. . We ordered the Bismark...And it was brilliant! I will definitely will return for the pizza for sure. Oh, and I will bring a pad to sit on. Those chairs are the worst.."

We absolutely loved the caramelized onions that formed part of the topping and we soacked up all the egg yolk with our leftover crust. Perfection! We were sad that the pizzas got cold after awhile. We shared the salted chocolate cake for dessert. Fantastic choice!! I am a big fan of molten lava cakes in general and this one did not disappoint. The portion is quite big - perfect for 2 ladies to share. The melted chocolate oozed out once we dug in. There was just the right amount of salt added to boost the flavor, and the generous scoop of vanilla gelato accompanied with crumbles complemented it perfectly. Heaven in a mouthful! Only gripe is that the kitchen is small so once the place hits capacity service can potentially get slow. Hopefully they have more help for peak hours."

My finger hovered over the mouse clicker for what felt like an eternity before I clicked on four. I may yet change my mind... nah, probably not. Gotta be tough sometimes, know what I'm sayin'?Anyway, the food and potential of this place is straight up five stars. The pizza is fantastic, and most probably my new favourite pizza in Singapore beating out previous faves Extra Virgin and Limoncello. The pasta also is simply wonderful: proper al dente, hand-made especially for the restaurant (according to front-of-house) with a delicately put-together sauce (the pappardelle ragu in this case) and no scrimping on quality ingredients.Moreover the price point is really quite brilliant. Approx. $70 for two pastas and a pizza. I'm not saying it's a steal but given the trend of skyrocketing prices these days, it's pretty damn great. The pizzas themselves are under $20 which is already cheaper than the two previous favourites I mentioned.What let this place down are some details. Firstly, the pizza came out incredibly quickly and was lukewarm. I suspect it was prepared earlier for another patron. The fact that I still rate it so highly is a testament to its overall quality but the misstep still deserves mention.The other letdown was the service. It wasn't terrible. Front of house (a European chap) served us the entire time. He was affable and fairly attentive. But i walked in at 8pm hoping to secure a table and was told that none were available until 9pm. I saw several free, assumed they were booked, agreed to come back for 9 and requested a call should any table free up earlier.My request was rebuffed. I was told that the restaurant was ""short-staffed"" and that front of house simply did not have time to check his reservations. This is not good enough. Staff your restaurant properly. When I returned at ten to nine, sure enough, the same tables that were available earlier were still empty. Something tells me no one ever ended up taking them and I could have well eaten earlier. This lack of attention and care for your customer is disappointing.The moral of this story: book ahead at Cicheti and accept some arrogance - the place is clearly buzzy right now. But the quality of the food is well worth turning a blind eye to the flaws."

The wood fired oven makes all the difference, and the crust comes out thin but not cracker-y, maintaining that chewiness and blistering I've been searching for in Singapore for a while. Toppings are minimal and classic. For SF-ers, most comparable to Delfina or Delarosa. The pastas are also very good because they are noticeably house-made, and whatever ""cicheti"" or small plates they have on special are a good bet. It's a small space so you're better off calling for a reservation and going during the week. Service is above average, with waiters keeping an eye on you, refilling wine glasses and sincerely in support of the menu items they recommend."

Cicheti is my new favorite pizza in Singapore. They impress me, which is hard to do given my probably unreasonably high standards for pizza. We have gone here once a week for the past month. Here's why:The mozzarella was fresh and perfect on both the salad and the pizza. The vegetables were all fresh. The char on the crust was there but not excessive. The Cioppino has so much seafood in it that I wonder how they can make a profit off of it. The tagliatelle carne is probably better than you would get in most restaurants in Rome. The gelato is very flavorful and the polenta cake pairs well with it.The only somewhat reasonable competition I know of in terms of Napoli-style (i.e. the best style) pizza is Operetta. I think Cicheti has a better ambiance than Operetta. While the quality of the ingredients are probably equivalent, Cicheti has better execution. The toppings were more evenly spread out on the pizza. The salad was also slightly larger. Cicheti is also cheaper than most other pizza places in Singapore, in part because they don't charge GST (yet?). It's a weird feeling to come here and get a salad, a pizza, a pasta, and the Cioppino for 90 SGD total. Comparing that to Operetta, which is nonetheless a great restaurant, it's like getting one of those dishes for free.If I were to think of anything to dock points for, it would be that their upstairs seating area is so cold that it gives me a headache. Lately we have been calling and asking to sit downstairs or outside and they have been accommodating.All-in-all, this is a rare Italian restaurant in Singapore that doesn't seem like mostly a cash-grab. They seem to care about the details, making great food with authentic ingredients, and making people happy."

The home-made capellini soaked in the saffron sauce completely, and it was a very well-balanced delicate sauce that I totally love.

The table was reserved on Monday evening at 6.30pm for dinner at 7.30pm on the same night. On arriving at the restaurant, my mum and I reached first and were shown to a high table meant for 6 people. We requested for a table with low seating since my mum has pain in her knees, so is unable to climb/ step up and sit comfortably. This was the start of the rudeness by the manager. He flatly refused to even make any attempt to accommodate us on any other table, saying that the place was fully booked (we were seated at the 3rd occupied table on the lower floor where there were 3 more tables empty at the time). So we adjusted and ordered our meal since we wanted to have a peaceful dinner. Midway through the meal my mum switched to the extra (till them empty) seat since I had ordered prawns and the smell was too strong and bothered her (she is vegetarian, and not a fan of seafood smell). Back came the manager to tell her off !!! We told him that she would switch back to her seat if any other guests showed up. That wasn't good enough for him, so instead of creating a hue and cry my mum simply sat back on the original seat.This is when I requested the manager to have a chat with me and then started his racist rant against Indians :(Some quotes from our conversation - things actually said by the Cicheti Manager to me: ""There is always problems with Indians only, they agree on the phone and then want something different when they come""""I hate Indians""""There are many other Italian restaurants, why don't you go there""We finished the food we had ordered till then, paid our bill, refused to pay the 10% service charge and left!We have lived in Singapore for nearly a decade now and also travelled extensively abroad. We have never faced such racist behaviour from people on the front line in the service industry. So appalled and disturbed by this experience that I felt compelled to share it in such great detail. I also saw that we are not the first to be spoken down to by the manager, there are some other reviews for the restaurant which say the same thing - the food is great, but the manager is awful and rude !"

Ordered the burratina for starters and 3 pizzas (diavola, bismark and prosciutto) for four and everything was quite delicious. The burratina cheese was fresh, cuddled by some rucola and delicious sweet onion bulbs. All 3 pizzas were perfectly done though I personally preferred the diavola and bismark.Unfortunately what dragged our meal down was the service. Despite being one of the earlier tables, boy did the food take forever to appear. Our starter took at least 20 minutes to be served despite most of the ingredients being raw. Our first pizza arrived about 20 minutes after that and then we waited again for the last two.We had to keep asking the servers to top up our water (every other table seemed to have a bottle of water except ours), provide serving cutlery for every dish (we stated we were sharing the food), check on our food...it just became painful after awhile. I don't think I've ever dreaded going back to restaurant that serves good food but I actually am. I think the front of house staff did the best they could but perhaps some smarter managemenet is needed - provide a bucket of cutlery on each table and flasks of water, have someone help the pizza guy (there was one guy flipping pizzas and 2-3 in the back with waitresses occasionally stepping in) and perhaps trim the menu if it expedites the lunch service."

My wife and I started with an Arugula and Pear Salad that had some roasted almonds, a balsamic glaze and a hint of goat cheese. Beautiful presentation...not the best tasting or best looking salad on the menu, but very good. We ordered a margarita with bufala mozzarella pizza as an appetizer...second time having this, terrific crust, a little under done but the mozzarella kills it, best pizza I've had in Singapore, hands down. I then ordered the paparedelle and lamb Raghu while my wife had the tagliatelle and squid ink pasta...both terrific, would have again, no questions asked.The negatives: they sat us right next to the door and they kept the door open. This is a problem because if you've been to Singapore before, it tends to be a little hot. I made the reservation 48 hours in advance, and they wouldn't move us away from the doorway, even though we were the first ones in the restaurant (1 star for service staff etiquette).

When we eventually visited Piedra Negra, my wife and I had a more than decent guacamole to start. We tried the lentil soup which is fabulous, tasty, simple and with a certain home-made quality. Our expectations went higher. While Diana had some really good chicken enchiladas made with a very hot and tasty green sauce, I asked for a lamb mixiote which turned out to be quite disappointing (expectations crashing down here). I need to explain: mixiotes are meat stews wrapped in the outer skin of maguey (century plant) leaves, or in aluminium foil or baking paper. The fact that I was given a stew inside a cute iron pot instead of wrapped in paper  means our pals at Piedra Negra don't understand what the dish is about. To be fair, the stew itself was delicious with the soft lamb melting in my mouth, worthy of a good Irish or Czech restaurant.The drinks menu has a decent assortment of tequilas, and a few Mexican beers, served with lime wedges just like everywhere, except in México. They have a single brand of mezcal, but it's the good stuff (I even got the worm for myself). Piedra Negra is a fun, lively place with salsa music, tasty food and a colourful, albeit kitsch environment. It's a pity they sell themselves as a Mexican restaurant. The fact that they put so much effort in looking Mexican rather than cooking Mexican ends up reinforcing stereotypes, instead of undermining them.Curious fact: the Mexican Embassy, ironically, is across the street."

Fine, fine...I've tried Piedra Negra's nachos before and their margaritas are pretty solid so why not just try a fish taco? Big mistake. The food here is horrendous. Nothing comparable to Mexican in California or TexMex in Chevys. After living in Singapore for the past three years, my expectations were LOW. Their baja fish taco tasted like sandpaper. The batter used to fry the fish was too thick and the fish was not fresh.As a prime establishment in Arab St., Piedra Negra simply needs to do better. With the new food culture popping up in Singapore (and the new array of Mexican restaurants), this one is a big thumbs down."

I was wrong. When we arrived it had already gotten busy and we were placed in a table in the alley. We had a large group (7 in total) and were all huddled around one table. There was so little room some members of our group had to place their plates in their lap to eat. There was a large open table close to the restaurant but we were told it was reserved. They held that table open for over an hour (no exaggeration) while we were left to dodge cars driving through the alley and eat out of our laps. The food was also nothing spectacular. My chicken quesadilla was decent but the thing they called a taco was more like an oversized taquito. It was a tortilla stuffed with meat and then rolled up and fried. It tasted okay but was not what we were expecting. The bright spot of the experience were the margaritas. We had a pitcher of strawberry and a pitcher of the original and they were both very tasty.The service staff was definitely overwhelmed; the restaurant is large and it was completely full. It did not seem like there were enough people working to adequately cover the needs of the restaurant and they were disorganized.

There are better Mexican spots out there, but if you insist on visiting (because, well, the location is great, and I did love the quirky decorative elements like the skeleton dolls), take note to avoid sitting by the main road.

Tasty food and a unique experience that builds greater textural food wisdom and provides an introduction to navigating life with out sight.I learned how important it was to hear someone's presence in the room (clicking sounds were often used to designate someone nearby)- to understand where they are and when they are moving, or close, or far away.The total damage to the wallet was about $330 at the end of it all.  Here's what we had:2 Pre-Dinner Signature Cocktails $402 Prix Fixe Dinners $1802 Mocktail Pairings (3 each) $601 Bottle of Sparkling Water $8In retrospect, I felt the mocktails were far too sweet, and not paired very well to the variety of dishes.  So if I came back, I might just get one cocktail downstairs to bring up to the meal with me and then just have sparkling water during the meal to really help the food flavors stand out.  If the mocktails had been more interesting and less like a blanket of sweet-juice over my pallet, it would have felt more worthy of adding to the meal."

We all heard a fair bit about the concept of dining in the total darkness, haven't we? I think NOX need no further introduction.NOX is located along the shop houses of beach road occupying 2 level of shop space.The service staff welcomed us into the lounge and gave us a drink menu to choose upon. The moment I sat down, the plushy sofa seat reminds me of Gold Class Cinema lounge, quite similar in a sense. Servers explained there is no food menu to choose from, rather there is a secret menu at $88++ per pax that consists of 12 dishes spreaded into 3 courses, appetizers, mains and desserts. Restaurant menu will be change every 6 - 8 weeks and should you have any dietary preference, e.g. vegetarian, please highlight to them.MocktailA citrus combination of orange with a bittersweet finishing taste from a pomelo. Its more sour than sweet per say with grapefruit, lemon juice, simple syrup and Grenadine that give a tart and sweet flavour to the naturally sour fruit.Grapefruit Spritz - $14The zesty and minty flavours make this quencher such refreshing. Out of 3 drinks tasted, I rate this the best. Ingredients were close to other drinks with passionfruit, simple syrup, lemon juice, lime juice, fresh mint leave and ginger ale.Virgin Passionfruit Julep - $14Being described as not the ordinary strawberry milkshake, it really make me wonder how does it taste like. Drink was milky pink served with little ice cubes and a strawberry. It was more of sweet and less of the sour taste with fresh milk, vanilla syrup, simple syrup, lemon juice and Amaretto Almond Syrup.Strawberry Shaker - $14StartersWe were served with the starters with a vegetarian on the left and 2 mini cones on the right for the non vegetarians. The fried vegetarian had a pleasant scent of truffle oil smell and looks good with its creaming sauce at its base.Starters for the non vegetarian was miniature. Raw salmon was served in the tip of the ice cream cone biscuit added with caviar. The presentation which depicts some plants on the soil had totally taken me away.Before Proceeding into the darknessWe was told not to bring any of our belongings to the dining area and had them kept in the given lockers, not even our handphones or watches with illumination / glow in the dark function. Instagrammers, sorry! For those who needs to go toilet, its best to have the ""passage"" clear before entering into the darkness.Entering the DarknessWe were quite excited while the door to the dining area swung open and we were greeted by the service staff. Have you wonder how to walk up a flight of steep stairs in total darkness? Well, we conquered the first stage by having 1 hand tapping to each other shoulder in a line and walk up the stair and into the dining.Dining in the darknessIt all started with uneasiness, getting ourselves up at the dining area. When we reached our table, we were led to the back of the chair and have to figure ourselves to take a seat under the clear instructions of course. We were briefed to locate our cutleries (spoon and fork) and the position to place our drinking glass on the table. With every course served, we was told to lean backwards to our chair as these visually impact servers placed the dishes onto our table accurately. Each course consist of 4 dishes served in a wooden tray and placed in a ""t"" shape. The rule to dine is to start with the dish nearest to ourselves at the ""6"" needle base on a analog clock and go clockwise.It was a challenge as well as fun locating the dish and place our spoon correctly into our mouth without dropping off the food, afterall this was my 1st time ever dining under such environment. I vividly remembered that our appetizers consist of rocket salad, foie gras, fried calamari, chick peas, lentils etc. While the mains were duck confit, wagyu beef cubes, cod fish. Meat was tender and tasty. Desserts was lava chocolate, popcorn ice cream, lemon sorbet and strudel. Finishing the mealWe stood up and walk a few meters on the carpeted ground using the same ""tapping shoulder method"" in a line before heading back to the stairs. Luckily the stairs were dimly lit and we could see and walk down under the shades of light. As we proceed back to the lounge, our eyes were tired and as though we had just woke up.We were told to fill up a questionaire to recall and guess what we had eaten. After which, the person in charge will come with an ipad, showing the pictures and naming out the 12 dishes we had.

The downstairs staff are so friendly and professional as are the waitstaff.  The waitstaff are your guides who help you walk up the stairs into the pitch black dining room, help explain where all your utensils, food, etc. are and also help you with anything you need. You really do make a ""transfer of trust"" to your guide, and this in itself is a very illuminating experience. As for the food, very unique! At $78 per person it does seem a bit steep, but they do serve quality food and it is fun to try and guess what you are eating. There are three courses, but each course comes with 4 different dishes (which also means 4 different desserts, a big plus if you have a sweet tooth like me) so a lot of food to try and my husband and I were definitely full afterwards.  Eating in the dark also raises your other senses so I could hear everything very clearly, and relying on just your taste to experience food is definitely very different from when you can clearly see what you are eating (and maybe even unconsciously judge food just based on the appearance).I was also trying to be extremely careful not to knock anything off the table. I am normally a bit of a messy eater so eating in the dark didn't help that, and I did end up with some chunks of food on my lap ;) The menu changes every month and a half, keeping the novelty and surprise alive. We would definitely return! They can also accommodate different dietary requirements. One of the highlights was at the end of the meal when they take you back downstairs and you write down what you think each dish consisted of and they reveal what it actually was and also show you the pictures of each dish. It was quite surprising and funny to see how wrong we were on some dishes and satisfying when you are right.  The hostess pointed out an interesting trend about how what you end up guessing right typically indicates what type of cuisine or food you normally eat. For example, most of the food I guessed right was geared towards veggies, seafood, etc. but my most inaccurate guesses were the meat dishes. All in all, my husband and I had a very wonderful time at Nox - Dine in the Dark, and it was a novel and enlightening dining activity to experience with each other."

Putting aside the gimmick of eating in the dark, which is fun and different for a few minutes, a restaurant still needs to sell food that people want to eat, and this food is objectionable. Anyone who has a food allergy - don't even try eating here. Went in a group with a few allergies and vegetarians - almost everyone ate something they weren't supposed to and in one case narrowly avoided a trip to the hospital.

We definitely spent a lot more time 'thinking' about and concentrating on the food we were eating, which made me realize how much I rush through my everyday eating experiences. It also did make my boyfriend and I giggle quite a bit as we tried 'toasting' in the dark as well as pouring water. Unfortunately I haven't given the restaurant more stars because I think it is overpriced for what it is. The 3-course menu is $88++ per person, add wine pairings (3 'small' glasses including a sickly sweet moscato at the end), plus 2 cocktails (as you spend 30 minutes in the bar prior to your dinner seating) and our bill was just shy of $370... Eek!!! Rather extravagant for a meal that I would call 'good' but definitely not 'fantastic'. I did like the quiz side of things at the end...something I was convinced was fish, then possibly chicken, turned out to be duck... and then they had one complete curve ball in there as well. Apparently they change the menu every 5-6 weeks so you don't have to worry about repetitive meals... having said that, I think this is something great to do once in your life but I wouldn't feel the need to return.

Well, we were glad that we proved ourselves wrong as we left the restaurant as clean as when we got there. :) This got to be the most interesting restaurant concept that I have been though the price is a little steep. The tasting menu is good (The chef was previously from Ember and Private Affairs)  but what stands out from other restaurants is that this dining concept teaches us a life lesson on appreciating the finest things in life without sight.  Having ""surrendered"" our phones and any light illuminating gadgets to the lockers provided within the restaurant prior to the dinner service, it is back to the good old school conversation that is sorely missed. Finally,  a gathering without having the camera to grace our food before we partake our meals and also  no distraction of Facebook, what's app and another other social media to distract us. Not to forget that the guide who is visually impaired did a great job with the dinner service.  He taught us how we can navigate around our new found surrounding and making us feel 'at home'. He shared with us how he turned visually impaired yet he is still very optimistic about life. We spent most of the time pacing ourselves with our friends and guessing the ingredients and dishes since there is a ""pop quiz"" at the end of the dinner.  We looked forward to moment where the hostess revealing the ""secret"" dishes. We were very excited that we got 70% of the dishes correct! :)It is not a restaurant that I would visit everyday but it is definitely a good experience and I do encourage everyone to check out this place at least once to see a different side of life."

When I heard about this from a friend I met in Thailand who just happened to be going to Singapore the same time I was, we made plans to do this and I'm so glad that I did because our travel partners were super lame and not adventurous enough to try this. This was undoubtedly one of the most interesting things I've ever done, let alone dining experiences. You're seated in the lobby with a menu to decide what you want; we did the ""ultimate NOX experience"" and I would highly recommend it. You start off with a small appetizer and cocktail downstairs. When you're done, you are led up a staircase and into a room with your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you, hoping you don't bump into anything along the way because you literally can't even see your hand in front of your face. Once you're seated, your appetizers arrive along with your first glass of wine assuming you do the wine pairing. I'm not a wine-o by any means, but I was glad to have splurged for the pairing. You get a glass with each course, the first cocktail and coffee or tea at the end. Your server will describe where everything is on your table so you can feel it out. About by the time we were done with the first course, I think we had pretty much got the hang of eating in the dark. Muscle memory I guess, you just remember where you left your fork, water/wine glass, etc. So unless there is some other offerings, I think the standard is a three course meal consisting of 4 plates per course and you eat in a clockwise fashion starting from 6 o'clock to 3 o'clock. It really makes you use and appreciate your scent and taste buds since you can't see what you're eating and guessing what you're tasting/smelling really makes you question how refined your palate is or how far off you are from reality. Our waiter told us a little bit about himself and how he lost his sight and his story was pretty inspiring. At the end of the meal, you are led downstairs to find out what each dish was and it's fun to talk about why you thought something was what it was (or wasn't) with other people you were eating with. I enjoyed every dish, some of which I didn't like having had them before; I won't say what because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. This was extremely enlightening and I would suggest it for anyone whose never tried such a thing and are adventurous enough to not know what's coming your way."

Since our family was visiting the Sultan Mosque, Zam Zam was a perfect choice, since it was right across the street from the mosque. We were seated on the second floor of the restaurant, which had air conditioning. Yay. There were many tables to be seated at. But, the tables were too close to each other. So, it felt quite cramped. Our waiter arrived to take our order. We got the mutton murtabak, mutton biryani, and pulled hot milk tea. Everything that we ordered was delicious. The murtabak tasted like an eggy, floury pancake with tons of flavorful mutton inside. Also, the rice in the biryani had a great fluffy texture. They didn't skimp on the mutton in this dish either. What I was quite impressed with was the pulled milk tea. It was such an aromatic tea, and had the right amount of sweet condensed milk. It was even better than the best pulled milk tea I've had in Hong Kong. The only thing was that the customer service was quite brutish here. It's probably best to be very direct with what you want to order. You can point to the menu items you want to get.

This place is right on Arab Street, directly in front of the Sultan Mosque. The specialization here is biryani and murtabak. I found the biryani to be on the bare side. It's got a good mix of spices for complexity, and although the mutton was tender and easy to peel, I've had better. Murtabak is very good. The deer option is their popular one, and it's good. It's an ideal shareable item. It's pretty bulky, and it's filling. They're generous with the meat portion inside. Also, you can try the fish head curry. My opinion? It's just okay. It makes for a good picture, but I found the actual fish to be rather tough- not as flaky/peel-able. This place has been featured on some travel programs, and it's also a popular YouTube travel vlog destination. That said, despite being a legitimate landmark mamak shop, I'll say that the food is good, but not amazingly outstanding as I initially expected. If you're from Malaysia, you probably will not be impressed, and there's a 90% chance you'll say/brag to some extent about how the mamak food in Malaysia is better than Singapore. Otherwise, this food will probably blow your tourist mind away. It's good though."

To eat, we started with the mutton biryani, which was a pile of basmati rice with a tender piece of mutton in the center and a creamy curry on the side. Though tasty, I found the rice to be rather bland (compared to some other biryanis I've had), since it wasn't actually cooked with the meat or with many spices. We also had the special deer murtabak, a stuffed flatbread filled with ground deer and egg. Overall, the murtabak was rather bland and flavorless--it came with a curry on the side for dipping, but otherwise had almost no flavor.

In between the layers of dough are ground beef and onion - but the flavor is fairly mild overall.I'd recommend using the fork and spoon to tear the murtabak into bite sized pieces, and then using the spoon to dip the pieces into the curry. The murtabak by itself is actually pretty mild in flavor and has a nice chewy texture. The dough is spread very thin but it has to have enough gluten to do that so the chew is nice.The curry has a mild body, isn't too heavy on the coconut, and is very dense in flavor. It's got good chili flavor, some heat, and some tang. Really tasty with the murtabak and really amps up the flavor.Skip the coffee. Seriously, not worth getting.

There are more tables upstairs to accommodate the diners. We were lucky to get a table at 7 pm as the rain probably kept people away. We shared the chicken murtabak and mutton briyani. Both were really good. The murtabak was huge and full of chicken pieces. I was expecting a flattish murtabak which was my experience at other joints so this was a surprise. The mutton was very tender and you could cut it with your fork. The rice was flavorful with the mutton and the gravy was just perfect too. Teh halia was another winner though if you dislike sugar, you will probably need to ask them to reduce it. For me, that is what a typical teh is. Sweet to wash down a heavy meal, and you don't even need dessert after that."

It comes in small, medium, or large, and a small size is good for one person. The roti was nicely browned and the chicken was moist with lots of flavor. We also tried the fish biriyani, but the fish was rather dry and the rice was intermittently flavored -- perhaps it was supposed to be like that, but I would have liked a more complex flavor. The curry that came with it also tasted mildly of lamb, which was a bit off putting. The iced teh chio was quite yummy, but my friend said the teh c wasn't sweet enough. Also, the tea was still piping hot when they iced it, making the bottom warm while the top cold, which made for a rather inconsistent drink. Service was spotty at best -- we were sitting right by the staircase where there were constantly waiters running back and forth, yet it was almost impossible to catch anyone's attention. It's possible that Zam Zam may have been a top-notch joint at some point, but like many other restaurants, complacence and laziness took over, making the food passionless and mediocre."

This is an Indian Muslim restaurant that specializes in Murtabak and Biryani, and it does both well, although it makes it's name with the Murtabak. Their Murtabak is fantastic, cooked just crispy enough, stuffed with egg, onion, and garlic; but it isn't too greasy. You can get it filled with Chicken, Mutton, Beef, Deer or Sardine and also vegetarian; I recommend the chicken.  It is served with a tasty, slightly spicy curry that is great for dipping. They also serve other typical mamak shop foods such as nasi goreng and mee goreng, both made in the bright red Malay style. All the food came out great, but beware, eat this for lunch and you will have a tough time staying awake in the afternoon as it is heavy and tasty."

The set up is pretty basic, but it was actually more comfortable than I expected! We ordered chicken and deer murtabak. The chicken was definitely my favourite, filled with delicious bright orange tandoori chicken. Deer wasn't bad, but a tad dry and I probably wouldn't order it again.

I wasn't planning on stopping here but as I walked down the sidewalk with that ""yes I'm Tourist"" look on my face, I was being ushered into a restaurant by some guy in a blue shirt standing in the middle of the sidewalk. At first I responded with a quick ""I'm good thanks"", but then the smells and happy noises coming from inside the restaurant caught my attention. So I realized blue shirt is actually a ZamZam employee and he was there to make sure you didn't miss the restaurant. Side note: the upstairs is chilled, so ask to go upstairs if the first floor is too hot or too crowded. So I go in, ordered a feast as you can see, the fish dish covered in a spicy red sauce was my favorite. Wow that was great!! The calamari was ok, a bit chewy but missing a strong flavor, I think if it was made to order it would be exceptional. The mutton biryani.... well it appears they cook the biryani on its own then if u want mutton/lamb, chicken, fish etc that just dig the appropriate protein outta the pot and into a plate then scope the biryani over the protein. The actual rice dish was great, the lamb...meh. overall I would give the entire mutton biryani a 6.5, cheap enough to order again but wouldn't cry if they were sold out. The fish head curry, I honestly can't review. I was so full from everything else and that dish was so HUGE I didn't know where to start. I did pick a pea sized portion of the fish and I gave the whole dish to some homeless guys on the corner. Going off their facial expressions, sound effects and speed: when they  realized what they had, removing the packaging, and digging in, I would give the fish dish a 9. Maybe next time I will judge it a bit better. Overall great experience I never planned to have."

What a heavenly mess!In addition to the Pratas, the Biryani is the signature dish of Zam Zam. The main component of these dishes is flavored rice. It will come with spicy roasted meat. You can also order a vegetarian version, of course. The rice is roasted with a good amount of onions, chilies and nut. Sometimes they will add a few raisins.

Although we had not heard much about zam zam , right after checking out the sultan mosque as we passed this place, some of the indian workers  called out to us in native tongue and urged us to check this place out.I have tried malabari cuisine in india as well (surprisingly many excellent moslem hotels in india are named zam zam, zam zam being the name of the well in mecca). malabari is remotely derived from saudi arabian  and tastes similar.Zam zam served both arabian and traditional singaporean dishes. We decided to try out the murtabak ( saudi arabian dish , (paratha) stuffed with fired onion , cucumber, tomato , lamb/beef /chicken or deer.  Since many workers were from south india , they helped us with the best out of the menu and we ended up getting a beef, lamb and deer murtabak with a biriyani and traditional sweet milk singaporean tea served with ice.It tasted so good and rich that i salivated a bit now writing this sentence. But beware it is basically super heavy food. after having one murtabak you are expected to cross a desert .We washed it down with the sweet milk tea which was not bad. but murtabak is a must try here. Its been 1 year since i visited and it still fills my senses with its unique flavor when i think about it.""I have always wanted to eat one with grated coconut mixed with lamb in it"". probably next time when iam in Calicut, IndiaPros1.

I've found a few small ones in mine before.  The dough is soft and chewy.  They are simply unbeatable, crispy and soft inside with liberal amounts of filling. Their briyani tastes just as good.

But if it's your first time visiting, it will be a nice experience! If you didn't make a reservation in advance, prepare to wait for 40-60 minutes, especially on a busy weekend night. This location is Clarke Quay is right near other bars and restaurants - so if you get an outdoor table (like we did) you'll have a great view. However, it does get loud later into the evening. Chili crab is a must get, obviously!! It was so delicious - spicy but fragrant flavor - but make sure to get extra buns or fried rice to sop up all the yummy sauce after you finish the crab meat. Goes well with a Tiger beer or Coca Cola :)Fried shrimp was meh - wouldn't get again. Would love to come back and try other dishes!"

Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out! This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!!

There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off. There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating.

My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs."

I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!!

I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!!  OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive.

We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd.

You don't need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early.Since it was only the two of us, we didn't want to order too many items. We ended up getting:-Chilli crab (OMG, so good. So messy.

I ordered a chilli crab, and while it was absolutely delicious, it would cost me about 100 SGD if I had not purchased the Klook voucher.I came here for lunch and since I was here on my own, it took about 20 minutes to get a seat without a reservation. They asked if I minded sharing a table with another party, and I said no because I knew I would get seated sooner. I was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother, so it was all pleasant.I ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab, along with the tools they provided to crack the shell. I noticed some other people were provided with gloves, and I think it's not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available. Maybe this would be something I'd be aware of if I ate more messy seafood or if I were a Singapore local?Big note: They will offer you peanuts and tea as if they don't cost extra, but they do!! So if you're trying to save some money, refuse the peanuts and tea. Just get some water (though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water).Another note: They don't have napkins or anything at the table, so if you need wet napkins, definitely call someone over to provide you with some. You will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy.Anyway, the chilli crab was very delicious; I basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too. The DIY breaking into the crab was fun but super messy. I'd probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce, but without the mess.Since I am just one person, I wasn't able to try any of the other delicious items they have. I hope I'll be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns!"

The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal.

Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer. Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab.

I'd pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is. We also ordered the ho fun, sadly I didn't take a picture of it but is really good! The gravy was very flavorful. My sister and I love the chili crab sauce  so much that we even ended up mixing it with our noodles. Finger licking, bowl slurping good."

The ambiance was amazing...the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby. You put your name in  the queue and they will call you when your table is ready. You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45.  Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in).  I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it. Morning Glory was to DIE FOR.  And their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce!It seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in Singapore so this is another good one! I enjoyed myself and left with a food coma!"

We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns. Chili crab - definitely an A+. It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade. Black pepper crab - that's a B. I have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere. Deep fried prawns in cereal - A.  The small order has generous amount of prawns. At $24 and came without the shells, that was not bad at all. This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better. Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have ""become fatter"" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab.  Service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously. So no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out Singapore's famous and very popular Chili Crab!!"

I love the flavor and savoring the sauces w a bowl of rice! we did not ask price as it's not indicated on the menu, and we were aware it was by weight so we ordered one to share along w other dishes. the razor clam was really delicious too! Overall, I like the food, although it's definitely overpriced especially the chili crab, ours came out to be over 60 SD for one small crab, as some of the yelpers mentioned, there were also shady about the price. And yes, they charged petty things like napkins, tea and peanuts!  I'd probably not want to return w such terrible manager and steep touristy price!"

Jumbo has numerous outlets across Singapore and this review is for The Riverwalk outlet. Their baby squid appetizer is a must have.They are crunchy with the right amount of sweetness. I had the herbal live Prawns, cereal prawns, mocha ribs and many other dishes. All were delicious. Service was great too as staff were very attentive. However, my dining experience was spoiled by a company having their staff dinner celebration. They were obnoxious with their loud 'yum shengs' throughout the duration I was there. While I understand it is Chinese New Year, I feel that party should have spared a thought for other diners in the restaurant. Maybe Jumbo can advise big parties to be mindful with their noise level next time as this restaurant is rather small and any noise is amplified in this enclosed airconditioned area. I talked to a service staff abt the noise disturbance and the management served my party with a complimentary dessert. A nice gesture by the management of Jumbo. While I appreciate the nice gesture, I would have preferred to enjoy my dinner without the noise disturbance. I recommend this seafood restaurant and hopefully next time, I will not be dining with large noisy groups."

So my sister and I trekked over to this location before our flight. Luckily for us, there was no wait! I think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in - it got really busy as we were eating. The chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns. I noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people (150 SGD) which included a variety of items. Although the price tag was steep, who knew when we would be back in Singapore! We took the plunge and I would say I am pretty happy with our decision. We were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda, dragonfruit lobster salad, fried rice with egg, cereal prawns, chili crab, and a pomelo sago dessert. I loved the lychee soda - refreshing and not too sweet. My least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad - it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo. The fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion (I think this could have been enough for 4 people)!The star of the show, the chili crab, was DELICIOUS! The crab meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was not as spicy as I thought it would be - in fact, it was pretty sweet. However, it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce. I also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal! Sounds weird but it was yummy! We ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago. I would give Jumbo Seafood five stars if not for the spotty service. The girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming. The waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly, but service was very slow."

Chilli Crab is expensive, I get it, but the quantity we got just wasn't the best for the price we paid. Other than that, though, now that that is out of the way, the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use. The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce. Would still recommend coming to this place if you've never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab, but I won't be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality:value ratio of Singapore's National Dish."

When we finally got a seat we ordered the benchmark Chili Crab,  kang kong sambal, and scallops in purple yam. We also ordered the Lychee Italian soda and the green apple Italian soda. The drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined. I wasn't drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab. The crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection. I wish I had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone. The crab was fresh and good. The kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good. Second piece of advice, the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce. The bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab. Would eat again with more folks to feel less guilty."

Keep in mind that there is one right across from Clark Quay that we got this location confused with - so we ended up being slightly late for our lunch reservation here. That said, we were able to get a seat inside easily enough, although by the time we had left, the restaurant was quite packed for a weekday lunch. Service was pretty quick and easy, although one of the menu items we wanted was not available despite it being early on in the day...a bit puzzling, but not a dealbreaker. The drink selection has a lot of juices, but the alcoholic selections (beer and wine) are a bit on the light side.The crabs themselves...they are huge, but they are very tasty as well. For someone who is a bit less experienced at pulling apart seafood, I made an abject mess of it (thankfully, there are wet wipes and plenty of extra napkins provided), but the meat was fresh and infused with the delicious fragrance and taste of red chilis. One could be forgiven for thinking that the crabs were swimming in chili oil before being cooked. Be prepared to fight for the meat, though; it takes a lot of patience, and you have to watch our for the sharper edges on the shell once your hands are slippery from the oil. Outside of that, though, the rest of the meal was very standard-issue Chinese food, and given the premium the restaurant places on the crab, everything else is pretty overpriced in comparison. The fish maw soup I had here was definitely worse than I have had in China (or in Chinatown in NYC), and it was quite a bit more expensive. The mushroom tofu dish we got as our other side was similarly bland and uninspiring, but it set us back nearly S$20 (possibly more).The crab lives up to the hype, and I would come back just to eat that alone. But the rest of the meal was overpriced mediocrity, to put it bluntly - unfortunately, the magic that comes along with the crab isn't really present on any of the other dishes."

I was told I must make a reservation and was glad for the advice when i realized i couldn't get in for a couple days. This location was less busy than the one just up the river at riverside. Overall my experience was just ok. The service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i hadn't ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it (I guess its like up selling) I told them I did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items (so they were going to charge me!) I was also by myself and was brought a rather large crab ($61) I probably should have requested something smaller but didn't think that was the way they worked here. The Chili crab was ok, but I won't go out of my way to try again. I would say this is a great place to try Chili or pepper crab if you are visiting, but once is enough."

However, despite a bit of difficulty getting reservation (we used the app Chope) and slowness in service, I have to say the food itself was AMAZING! :) For the two of us, we ordered 1 veggie dish sautéed in garlic sauce and one chili crab and they were both a pure delicacy! We got medium spiciness and was just perfectly sauced, spiced, cooked/steamed and cracked  (to be eaten easily). What a joy! We then proceeded to order a Pepper crab which was warmed in delicious butter and exotic black pepper and it was like experiencing a whole new world, a world's apart journey in flavor from the chili crab. Yum!! I'd recommend both since they are very different, but if I had to choose one, would probably go with the classic (chili crab). Also beware that the crabs are not cheap - about $70 SGD a piece - so be prepared to spend some $$$ if you're willing to adventure on trying both! Next time I definitely want to try their buns to dip it in the chili sauce as well as the fried rice! Also I'd highly recommend this location located by the beautifully lit Singapore River as it's only a short walk to all the beautiful sights and sceneries by the water as well as the Fullerton Hotels and the Merlion :)"

What tainted our experience was the hostess at the other Jumbo location on Merchant road (not sure where this review most appropriately fits). Being tourists, our cab dropped us off at the Merchant road location, right in time for our reservation at the Riverwalk. Once they let us know we were in the wrong spot, we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way. The hostess said she would not. Having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess, and she reminded us we had 10 minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away. Eventually, the food was good. I have never had chili crab, and thought it was okay. The fried buns are a bit greasy, I would stick with the regular ones. The food is pricey as expected.

Minor thing to call out, they put peanuts on the table for snacking before the meal comes out, you think it's free but there's a small charge.  I've also heard they sometimes charge for the napkins (which you'll need) so ask before taking a big stack.  Overall, this place is slightly price given it's a chain restaurant but it was a good meal!Make sure to call for a reservation.  We had a 7pm rez and had until 8:30 to finish, I didn't feel rushed but I'm sure they would have notified us had we overstayed out time.  There's another location just a short walk on the Clarke Quay Riverside walk so make sure to go to the right location."

Maybe it is the mess where everyone just digs in using our hands and fingers, trying to pry the sweet meat from the shells. Bibs are now provided so you don't get gravy stains on your tops. The must order dish is the chili crab, plus the fried mini buns (mantous) to soak up the addictive spicy sweet chili gravy. The rest is an afterthought. The food is generally decent but for the fried rice and hor fun, they lacked the wok hei flavor of tze char. Sambal kang kong, fried tofu, cereal prawns and the likes are just ok or average. The service is fast and there are two seatings. The first is from 5.45pm to 7.45pm and with the speedy way they served the dishes, our two tables were done within 90 minutes. Lots of eating and less talking I guess. Getting to the place is a bit of a hassle, if you have elderly or those who can't walk well in your dining party, as they are plenty of steps to navigate.

Although I use Yelp regularly, I never write reviews but this one place was so unbelievably bad, I felt compelled to write my first review. On the one positive side, the seating process is efficient given that the place is run like a factory. On a busy Friday night I was seated within 10 minutes. But sadly this is the only positive thing about the restaurant. The service was appalling! I was the only one at the table who didn't have a place setting and I asked 4 times before I got one. The waitress kept mumbling under her nose. I noticed that none of the dishes on the menu had prices. I ordered one chili crab and a glass of wine. The waitress also brought peanuts and tea. I didn't love the crab but felt good about having tried it as the typical local dish. Then the bill came. It was over $120. The crab was $80 which I thought was ridiculously overpriced. I was also charged for the peanuts and tea I didn't order and also didn't touch. I was appalled. The entire experience was very unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth. I recommend you avoid this restaurant."

It was definitely disappointing to speak to a manager who's more defending himself rather trying to accommodate his customers.Moving on to chili crabs, it was delicious, forgot which one we ordered, but it's got eggs on its broth, fresh and juicy! I love the flavor and savoring the sauces w a bowl of rice! we did not ask price as it's not indicated on the menu, and we were aware it was by weight so we ordered one to share along w other dishes. the razor clam was really delicious too! Overall, I like the food, although it's definitely overpriced especially the chili crab, ours came out to be over 60 SD for one small crab, as some of the yelpers mentioned, there were also shady about the price. And yes, they charged petty things like napkins, tea and peanuts!  I'd probably not want to return w such terrible manager and steep touristy price!"

BUT, you get a yummy sauce for some bread with the chili option, so depends if you're in a dippin' mood or not. I gave it 3-stars mostly because the service was very very average. Everyone around us seemed to be taken care of, while we felt ignored for 90% of our meal. I realize the service-standard is completely different in the US of A compared to many parts of the world, but it was enough to make us leave in a hurry.

Even with a reservation on a weeknight, we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. But once we sat down it didn't take long for them to take our order and deliver our starters.The drunken shrimp tasted exactly like I thought it would, in a flavorful broth with a hint of liquor. The pepper crab tasted like pepper crab should. I'm always amazed at how they can get the meat to taste all peppery even though the crab shell is tough to break through! And of course, the granddaddy of them all- chilli crab. I liked this version a lot because it did have a little kick to it, but not to the point where I was sweating balls.The service was good, even though the restaurant was fully booked. I also found it kid friendly, as our table did have a toddler, there were other smaller kids at the tables nearby us, and none of the other diners seemed to mind. Perhaps it's because we're all wearing bibs, given how messy crab can get, so we all look like children anyway.Overall, a solid place to bring tourists (or just your local selves!) to experience Singaporean realness. Just remember that this location is NOT to be mistaken for ""Riverside Point"", which is located in the heart of Clarke Quay. I made that mistake while reserving, since this location is called ""The Riverwalk"". But no worries, as they are only about a 5-7 minute walk apart."

The shells on those crabs are so thick you almost need a small hammer in addition to the cracker. The little fried buns they give you are great to soak up the sauce the crab if floating in. The pepper crab was okay. Peppery. Totally outdone by the chili crab.The egg custard shrimp were delicious. The whole peking duck was wonderful. They prepare the whole thing- bring it table side and then skin it in front of you - Wrapping the bits of crispy skin into crepes with cucumber, green onion and a bit of sauce. Yummy! Then take the duck back and roast it again and bring it to you de-boned and sliced. The seafood fried rice was a bit on the salty side.The venison was very tender, not gamey at all and almost buttery. Both dining experiences were great and I'd say this is a must go - local or tourist :)"

I think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in - it got really busy as we were eating. The chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns. I noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people (150 SGD) which included a variety of items. Although the price tag was steep, who knew when we would be back in Singapore! We took the plunge and I would say I am pretty happy with our decision. We were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda, dragonfruit lobster salad, fried rice with egg, cereal prawns, chili crab, and a pomelo sago dessert. I loved the lychee soda - refreshing and not too sweet. My least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad - it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo. The fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion (I think this could have been enough for 4 people)!The star of the show, the chili crab, was DELICIOUS! The crab meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was not as spicy as I thought it would be - in fact, it was pretty sweet. However, it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce. I also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal! Sounds weird but it was yummy! We ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago. I would give Jumbo Seafood five stars if not for the spotty service.

The drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined. I wasn't drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab. The crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection. I wish I had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone. The crab was fresh and good. The kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good. Second piece of advice, the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce. The bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab.

Atmosphere is to be desired. Big open room packed with tables. Huge fish tanks in the back where you watch whatever you ordered get taken. Lol maybe it's just my tender heart but I've always had a hard time with that type of display, but moving on. A lot of bareness in regards to decoration etc.We had a wait but it wasn't bad for dinner on a Saturday night. Once we were seated we went to order. I thought seafood would be easy gluten free but apparently not. I was initially told they couldn't make me anything. When my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that I could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces (it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them, even the garlic and olive oil) and the scallops and vegetables plain. My friends ordered other things. The worst part is that all these things came out and I was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for 45 mins. They finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well. We then all sat and waited. We had to ask five.. Yes five.. Times about the last crab. Me still starving. We were blown off several times. Asked to speak to a manager twice who never came. Two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat. Food was good though mine was bland as they offered no sauce options, but seafood was fresh and portions good. They also charge for everything without telling you, the peanuts on the table? Yep. The tea they bring you? Bet ur bottom $When I return to Singapore I won't be rushing back."

Needless to say, expectations were met and then some.The queue was short on the Saturday night in January that we went (party of three). The night was warm, and there was a cool breeze off of the river. People were starting to gather at the lively Clark Quay area, and only made the anticipation of my meal greater.Once seated, we ordered the Black Pepper Crab, Chili Crab,Cereal Prawns, Scallops in Yam Rings, and then load of fried and steamed buns. For three people it looked like a lot of food (and it was), but I could not stop eating. The flavors were not too spicy, not too sweet, not too salty - nice and balanced.

I was told I must make a reservation and was glad for the advice when i realized i couldn't get in for a couple days. This location was less busy than the one just up the river at riverside. Overall my experience was just ok. The service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i hadn't ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it (I guess its like up selling) I told them I did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items (so they were going to charge me!) I was also by myself and was brought a rather large crab ($61) I probably should have requested something smaller but didn't think that was the way they worked here. The Chili crab was ok, but I won't go out of my way to try again. I would say this is a great place to try Chili or pepper crab if you are visiting, but once is enough."

After I asked him he said they are not complimentary and we had to pay for it so I kindly asked him to remove it from our table as I was not about to pay for something I didn't order. The food was good, DEFINITELY order the black pepper crab if you like spicy food. It was sooooo tasty and full of flavor. The drinks was ok nothing special and the portion of the fried rice was a lot. We also enjoyed the free wifi!"

One of the reasons I really like jumbos is also because you can get the cereal prawns deshelled. I'm sorry but I'm a white guy and I dont like durian and I dont like prawns with the shell on.  I find the chili crab sauce here to be a tad bit sweeter.  There are other spots that have bigger crabs but I think all around with the food, crab options and different branches all over its a pretty safe bet. In terms of this branch there is ALWAYS a wait. If youre calling for reservations the same day for dinner forget it. Otherwise you'll be eating at 10pm.  The service is not friendly but its there.  If youre a live here and you and your friends are ALWAYS taking friends/visitors to chili crab sign up for the jumbo membership:)"

But if it's your first time visiting, it will be a nice experience! If you didn't make a reservation in advance, prepare to wait for 40-60 minutes, especially on a busy weekend night. This location is Clarke Quay is right near other bars and restaurants - so if you get an outdoor table (like we did) you'll have a great view. However, it does get loud later into the evening. Chili crab is a must get, obviously!! It was so delicious - spicy but fragrant flavor - but make sure to get extra buns or fried rice to sop up all the yummy sauce after you finish the crab meat. Goes well with a Tiger beer or Coca Cola :)Fried shrimp was meh - wouldn't get again. Would love to come back and try other dishes!"

Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes.

My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs."

I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!!

I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!!  OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive. I still love my chilly crab and want to come back to Singapore for this, but next time, my bf for sure will just watch me eat!!!"

We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored."

I ordered a chilli crab, and while it was absolutely delicious, it would cost me about 100 SGD if I had not purchased the Klook voucher.I came here for lunch and since I was here on my own, it took about 20 minutes to get a seat without a reservation. They asked if I minded sharing a table with another party, and I said no because I knew I would get seated sooner. I was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother, so it was all pleasant.I ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab, along with the tools they provided to crack the shell. I noticed some other people were provided with gloves, and I think it's not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available. Maybe this would be something I'd be aware of if I ate more messy seafood or if I were a Singapore local?Big note: They will offer you peanuts and tea as if they don't cost extra, but they do!! So if you're trying to save some money, refuse the peanuts and tea. Just get some water (though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water).Another note: They don't have napkins or anything at the table, so if you need wet napkins, definitely call someone over to provide you with some. You will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy.Anyway, the chilli crab was very delicious; I basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too. The DIY breaking into the crab was fun but super messy. I'd probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce, but without the mess.Since I am just one person, I wasn't able to try any of the other delicious items they have. I hope I'll be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns!"

The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well!

Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer. Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab. If you're willing to deal with the steep prices (they charge for everything including the peanuts and wipes), the lackluster service and are lucky enough to score a reservation in the air conditioned section, you will be treated to a very tasty meal."

It was a lot for 5 people!The cereal prawns were really crispy, loved the cereal topping, we devoured the entire dish right after it hit the table! The prawn rolls were good as well.

The sauce for the Chili  Alaska King crab tasted like ketchup and was a little bit spicy not what I was expecting.Service was also very disappointing, workers were rushing us to pay the bill even before we started to eat. Felt like we were been hustled, peanuts that we did not ask for and was put in our table 2 SGD in the bill, bread rolls that I didn't even touch also put in the bill, at least ask the guest if they want it instead of putting it on the table and charging for it.

My sister and I got one crab to share which was more than enough. It's truly the sauce that makes this dish so great. I love tomatoes, anything tomato based I'm typically a fan right off the bat and their sauce has a tomato-y base that is sweet and spicy and so addicting! I'd pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is. We also ordered the ho fun, sadly I didn't take a picture of it but is really good! The gravy was very flavorful. My sister and I love the chili crab sauce  so much that we even ended up mixing it with our noodles. Finger licking, bowl slurping good."

The ambiance was amazing...the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby. You put your name in  the queue and they will call you when your table is ready. You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45.  Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in).  I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it. Morning Glory was to DIE FOR.  And their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce!It seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in Singapore so this is another good one!

We are not on the airport runway, lol!), indoor seating with really good AC, no visible bugs and plenty of soap & towels for the patrons. Back to my review:I love that the restaurant gives out bibs to the patrons. The bibs are so cute!!Had a reservation at noon today. We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns. Chili crab - definitely an A+. It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade. Black pepper crab - that's a B. I have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere. Deep fried prawns in cereal - A.  The small order has generous amount of prawns. At $24 and came without the shells, that was not bad at all. This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better. Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have ""become fatter"" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab.  Service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously. So no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out Singapore's famous and very popular Chili Crab!!"

But I must say, it was VERY pricy for the crab. Also I thought the flavours hadn't really penetrated the crab. It tasted more like ketchup and sweetness than a savoury food which was really disappointing. The rice and buns were okay. Maybe because the location was in a very central location, which was why it was busier and more expensive? I would suggest trying somewhere else?Tip: the peanuts they offer you at the beginning cost money, so if you don't want to eat them, don't let them put it down."

Night one after arrival, we found ourselves here.  There were 6 of us, and I thought my (male) coworkers were joking when they said we were going to order 4 crabs.  At about $60/crab...say what?!?1  But wanting to have the full experience, I acquiesced.  The final menu for our table:- 4 crabs (2 chili, 2 black pepper)- an order of the tiger prawns- fresh steamed abalone- fried rice- bok choy (because you need your greens)The crabs were good, but to be honest, I enjoyed the black pepper crab better than the chili crab, which was marinated in so much tomato sauce that it was actually quite difficult to eat.   The tiger prawns though....this was worth it.  It was about $15/skewer (of ONE prawn) but it was one of the best prawns I have ever had.  The abalone was silky smooth.  The fried rice and bok choy were as good as fried rice and bok choy can be, but nothing out of this world.The total bill was a whopping $700SGD...ouch!  But when in Rome, right?  I am glad we tried it, but at these prices, I am not so sure it was worth it.  I wish I had a point of comparison, and should have tried it at other places, but that will have to wait for the next trip.   I would definitely recommend a go at the Abalone and for sure the prawns. This is what upped it from a 3 to 4 star in my books.p.s. I truly do appreciate they have a hand-washing station. A definitely must! =)"

It was definitely disappointing to speak to a manager who's more defending himself rather trying to accommodate his customers.Moving on to chili crabs, it was delicious, forgot which one we ordered, but it's got eggs on its broth, fresh and juicy! I love the flavor and savoring the sauces w a bowl of rice! we did not ask price as it's not indicated on the menu, and we were aware it was by weight so we ordered one to share along w other dishes. the razor clam was really delicious too! Overall, I like the food, although it's definitely overpriced especially the chili crab, ours came out to be over 60 SD for one small crab, as some of the yelpers mentioned, there were also shady about the price.

Just look at the sgd/gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay, or that will satisfy ur belly. Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out! This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!!

There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off. There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating.

My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs."

I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!!  OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive.

We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored."

You don't need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early.Since it was only the two of us, we didn't want to order too many items. We ended up getting:-Chilli crab (OMG, so good. So messy.

I ordered a chilli crab, and while it was absolutely delicious, it would cost me about 100 SGD if I had not purchased the Klook voucher.I came here for lunch and since I was here on my own, it took about 20 minutes to get a seat without a reservation. They asked if I minded sharing a table with another party, and I said no because I knew I would get seated sooner. I was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother, so it was all pleasant.I ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab, along with the tools they provided to crack the shell. I noticed some other people were provided with gloves, and I think it's not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available. Maybe this would be something I'd be aware of if I ate more messy seafood or if I were a Singapore local?Big note: They will offer you peanuts and tea as if they don't cost extra, but they do!! So if you're trying to save some money, refuse the peanuts and tea. Just get some water (though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water).Another note: They don't have napkins or anything at the table, so if you need wet napkins, definitely call someone over to provide you with some. You will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy.Anyway, the chilli crab was very delicious; I basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too. The DIY breaking into the crab was fun but super messy. I'd probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce, but without the mess.Since I am just one person, I wasn't able to try any of the other delicious items they have. I hope I'll be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns!"

The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal. When I saw this on the menu, I thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp, but when the dish came, I saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp!

Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer. Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab.

My sister and I got one crab to share which was more than enough. It's truly the sauce that makes this dish so great. I love tomatoes, anything tomato based I'm typically a fan right off the bat and their sauce has a tomato-y base that is sweet and spicy and so addicting! I'd pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is. We also ordered the ho fun, sadly I didn't take a picture of it but is really good! The gravy was very flavorful. My sister and I love the chili crab sauce  so much that we even ended up mixing it with our noodles. Finger licking, bowl slurping good."

The ambiance was amazing...the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby. You put your name in  the queue and they will call you when your table is ready. You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45.  Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in).  I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it. Morning Glory was to DIE FOR.  And their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce!It seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in Singapore so this is another good one!

Back to my review:I love that the restaurant gives out bibs to the patrons. The bibs are so cute!!Had a reservation at noon today. We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns. Chili crab - definitely an A+. It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade. Black pepper crab - that's a B. I have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere. Deep fried prawns in cereal - A.  The small order has generous amount of prawns. At $24 and came without the shells, that was not bad at all. This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better. Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have ""become fatter"" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab.  Service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously. So no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out Singapore's famous and very popular Chili Crab!!"

This is what upped it from a 3 to 4 star in my books.p.s. I truly do appreciate they have a hand-washing station. A definitely must! =)"

It was definitely disappointing to speak to a manager who's more defending himself rather trying to accommodate his customers.Moving on to chili crabs, it was delicious, forgot which one we ordered, but it's got eggs on its broth, fresh and juicy! I love the flavor and savoring the sauces w a bowl of rice! we did not ask price as it's not indicated on the menu, and we were aware it was by weight so we ordered one to share along w other dishes. the razor clam was really delicious too! Overall, I like the food, although it's definitely overpriced especially the chili crab, ours came out to be over 60 SD for one small crab, as some of the yelpers mentioned, there were also shady about the price. And yes, they charged petty things like napkins, tea and peanuts!  I'd probably not want to return w such terrible manager and steep touristy price!"

I had the herbal live Prawns, cereal prawns, mocha ribs and many other dishes. All were delicious. Service was great too as staff were very attentive. However, my dining experience was spoiled by a company having their staff dinner celebration. They were obnoxious with their loud 'yum shengs' throughout the duration I was there. While I understand it is Chinese New Year, I feel that party should have spared a thought for other diners in the restaurant. Maybe Jumbo can advise big parties to be mindful with their noise level next time as this restaurant is rather small and any noise is amplified in this enclosed airconditioned area. I talked to a service staff abt the noise disturbance and the management served my party with a complimentary dessert. A nice gesture by the management of Jumbo. While I appreciate the nice gesture, I would have preferred to enjoy my dinner without the noise disturbance. I recommend this seafood restaurant and hopefully next time, I will not be dining with large noisy groups."

So my sister and I trekked over to this location before our flight. Luckily for us, there was no wait! I think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in - it got really busy as we were eating. The chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns. I noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people (150 SGD) which included a variety of items. Although the price tag was steep, who knew when we would be back in Singapore! We took the plunge and I would say I am pretty happy with our decision. We were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda, dragonfruit lobster salad, fried rice with egg, cereal prawns, chili crab, and a pomelo sago dessert. I loved the lychee soda - refreshing and not too sweet. My least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad - it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo. The fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion (I think this could have been enough for 4 people)!The star of the show, the chili crab, was DELICIOUS! The crab meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was not as spicy as I thought it would be - in fact, it was pretty sweet. However, it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce. I also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal! Sounds weird but it was yummy! We ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago. I would give Jumbo Seafood five stars if not for the spotty service. The girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming. The waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly, but service was very slow."

The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce.

When we finally got a seat we ordered the benchmark Chili Crab,  kang kong sambal, and scallops in purple yam. We also ordered the Lychee Italian soda and the green apple Italian soda. The drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined. I wasn't drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab. The crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection. I wish I had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone. The crab was fresh and good. The kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good. Second piece of advice, the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce. The bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab. Would eat again with more folks to feel less guilty."

Keep in mind that there is one right across from Clark Quay that we got this location confused with - so we ended up being slightly late for our lunch reservation here. That said, we were able to get a seat inside easily enough, although by the time we had left, the restaurant was quite packed for a weekday lunch. Service was pretty quick and easy, although one of the menu items we wanted was not available despite it being early on in the day...a bit puzzling, but not a dealbreaker. The drink selection has a lot of juices, but the alcoholic selections (beer and wine) are a bit on the light side.The crabs themselves...they are huge, but they are very tasty as well. For someone who is a bit less experienced at pulling apart seafood, I made an abject mess of it (thankfully, there are wet wipes and plenty of extra napkins provided), but the meat was fresh and infused with the delicious fragrance and taste of red chilis. One could be forgiven for thinking that the crabs were swimming in chili oil before being cooked. Be prepared to fight for the meat, though; it takes a lot of patience, and you have to watch our for the sharper edges on the shell once your hands are slippery from the oil. Outside of that, though, the rest of the meal was very standard-issue Chinese food, and given the premium the restaurant places on the crab, everything else is pretty overpriced in comparison. The fish maw soup I had here was definitely worse than I have had in China (or in Chinatown in NYC), and it was quite a bit more expensive. The mushroom tofu dish we got as our other side was similarly bland and uninspiring, but it set us back nearly S$20 (possibly more).The crab lives up to the hype, and I would come back just to eat that alone. But the rest of the meal was overpriced mediocrity, to put it bluntly - unfortunately, the magic that comes along with the crab isn't really present on any of the other dishes."

My host ordered many side dishes which were also delicious. The atmosphere was nice too. While it was a muggy Singapore night, after a small beer and the start of food, I paid no mind."

Overall my experience was just ok. The service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i hadn't ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it (I guess its like up selling) I told them I did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items (so they were going to charge me!) I was also by myself and was brought a rather large crab ($61) I probably should have requested something smaller but didn't think that was the way they worked here. The Chili crab was ok, but I won't go out of my way to try again. I would say this is a great place to try Chili or pepper crab if you are visiting, but once is enough."

We had one chili crab and one pepper crab for five people. Soooo good. also some fried noodles, spinach with garlic, prawns with some kind of sweet, dry crust on them (wish I could remember the name) and of course, buns to soak up the sauces. Plenty of pitchers of cold Tiger beer to round out the meal. Reservations are highly recommended as it is crowded every night. On the border of Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Service is efficient, lots of people refilling glasses, getting more beer. Not overly friendly but that's not really an issue, you'll be too busy chowing down to care. Highly recommended"

However, despite a bit of difficulty getting reservation (we used the app Chope) and slowness in service, I have to say the food itself was AMAZING! :) For the two of us, we ordered 1 veggie dish sautéed in garlic sauce and one chili crab and they were both a pure delicacy! We got medium spiciness and was just perfectly sauced, spiced, cooked/steamed and cracked  (to be eaten easily). What a joy! We then proceeded to order a Pepper crab which was warmed in delicious butter and exotic black pepper and it was like experiencing a whole new world, a world's apart journey in flavor from the chili crab. Yum!! I'd recommend both since they are very different, but if I had to choose one, would probably go with the classic (chili crab). Also beware that the crabs are not cheap - about $70 SGD a piece - so be prepared to spend some $$$ if you're willing to adventure on trying both! Next time I definitely want to try their buns to dip it in the chili sauce as well as the fried rice! Also I'd highly recommend this location located by the beautifully lit Singapore River as it's only a short walk to all the beautiful sights and sceneries by the water as well as the Fullerton Hotels and the Merlion :)"

What tainted our experience was the hostess at the other Jumbo location on Merchant road (not sure where this review most appropriately fits). Being tourists, our cab dropped us off at the Merchant road location, right in time for our reservation at the Riverwalk. Once they let us know we were in the wrong spot, we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way. The hostess said she would not. Having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess, and she reminded us we had 10 minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away. Eventually, the food was good. I have never had chili crab, and thought it was okay. The fried buns are a bit greasy, I would stick with the regular ones. The food is pricey as expected.

Minor thing to call out, they put peanuts on the table for snacking before the meal comes out, you think it's free but there's a small charge.  I've also heard they sometimes charge for the napkins (which you'll need) so ask before taking a big stack.  Overall, this place is slightly price given it's a chain restaurant but it was a good meal!Make sure to call for a reservation.  We had a 7pm rez and had until 8:30 to finish, I didn't feel rushed but I'm sure they would have notified us had we overstayed out time.  There's another location just a short walk on the Clarke Quay Riverside walk so make sure to go to the right location."

Maybe it is the mess where everyone just digs in using our hands and fingers, trying to pry the sweet meat from the shells. Bibs are now provided so you don't get gravy stains on your tops. The must order dish is the chili crab, plus the fried mini buns (mantous) to soak up the addictive spicy sweet chili gravy. The rest is an afterthought. The food is generally decent but for the fried rice and hor fun, they lacked the wok hei flavor of tze char. Sambal kang kong, fried tofu, cereal prawns and the likes are just ok or average. The service is fast and there are two seatings. The first is from 5.45pm to 7.45pm and with the speedy way they served the dishes, our two tables were done within 90 minutes. Lots of eating and less talking I guess. Getting to the place is a bit of a hassle, if you have elderly or those who can't walk well in your dining party, as they are plenty of steps to navigate.

Recommend this spot for people visiting or for a special date that you met somewhere other than Tinder."

My friend and I came here to try their crab around 9:30pm. Our waitress told us they only have one last Alaskan king crab left that would cost about $600. Our first reaction was holy &$@/. We even asked her if she was sure if that was the only type of crab left and if we could get any other type of smaller crab, but she promised us that it was the last one and even spoke to the back with her transponder to ""save the LAST crab for me"". She even promised us that it would not be too much for 2 people. I thought it was weird that this place would run out of its signature dish so quick, but since I'm only here for 2 days, I decided to get it.Then as more customers came and ordered smaller crabs, we called her over to question her and she denied everything and saying she only said that was the last Alaskan crab. Now I would forgive her if we didn't ask her 3 times to make sure that was the last of any crab and if she didn't quote ""save the LAST CRAB for me""...They also charge everything from peanuts to water, and they WON'T tell you unless you ask. So definitely watch out for that since they bring out the peanut to you without you asking for it like it was free."

The photos of the food on the menu did NOT match what arrived in several cases.  The low quantity and low quality of the food for the high price charged was simply outrageous.  They seemed more interested in upselling alcohol than serving food, once they knew you weren't going to be drinkers, the wait-staff ignored us for quite a while before coming back to place our order.  When the food was ready, it was rushed to the table in an effort to turn the table as soon as possible.  They charged $78.00 for a single chopped up crab (a/k/a crab bits) was more than a bit pricey for what you got. For $22.00 you get a 3-cm cube of codfish. Six tiny scallops surrounded by an enormous amount of yam cost $18, again not worth the price and they tasted oily.Maybe they were good at one time, that's not the case any more -- at least not tonight, and for a bill over $200.00, you'd expect that you'd get quality service and quality food with a hand-wash facility for patrons and staff that had the basic necessities. All-in-all, I have nothing positive to say about this place and need to simply state that this seems to be an expensive, low-quality tourist trap for those that don't know any better.  Avoid at all costs and seek Singapore Chilli Crab elsewhere -- ask a LOCAL.  We'll never return."

For sides we had greens at almost 12 USD, and the portion was tiiiiny. Do not accept the peanuts they try to give you when you first sit down. They will charge you.

BUT, you get a yummy sauce for some bread with the chili option, so depends if you're in a dippin' mood or not. I gave it 3-stars mostly because the service was very very average. Everyone around us seemed to be taken care of, while we felt ignored for 90% of our meal. I realize the service-standard is completely different in the US of A compared to many parts of the world, but it was enough to make us leave in a hurry.

Even with a reservation on a weeknight, we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. But once we sat down it didn't take long for them to take our order and deliver our starters.The drunken shrimp tasted exactly like I thought it would, in a flavorful broth with a hint of liquor. The pepper crab tasted like pepper crab should. I'm always amazed at how they can get the meat to taste all peppery even though the crab shell is tough to break through! And of course, the granddaddy of them all- chilli crab. I liked this version a lot because it did have a little kick to it, but not to the point where I was sweating balls.The service was good, even though the restaurant was fully booked. I also found it kid friendly, as our table did have a toddler, there were other smaller kids at the tables nearby us, and none of the other diners seemed to mind. Perhaps it's because we're all wearing bibs, given how messy crab can get, so we all look like children anyway.Overall, a solid place to bring tourists (or just your local selves!) to experience Singaporean realness. Just remember that this location is NOT to be mistaken for ""Riverside Point"", which is located in the heart of Clarke Quay. I made that mistake while reserving, since this location is called ""The Riverwalk"". But no worries, as they are only about a 5-7 minute walk apart."

The shells on those crabs are so thick you almost need a small hammer in addition to the cracker. The little fried buns they give you are great to soak up the sauce the crab if floating in. The pepper crab was okay. Peppery. Totally outdone by the chili crab.The egg custard shrimp were delicious. The whole peking duck was wonderful. They prepare the whole thing- bring it table side and then skin it in front of you - Wrapping the bits of crispy skin into crepes with cucumber, green onion and a bit of sauce. Yummy! Then take the duck back and roast it again and bring it to you de-boned and sliced. The seafood fried rice was a bit on the salty side.The venison was very tender, not gamey at all and almost buttery. Both dining experiences were great and I'd say this is a must go - local or tourist :)"

What is the name of this delicious dish?

Even I lived in Singapore would still like to visit again and again. Famous tourism restaurant can still provide very nice chili crab which is my favorite one in SG. Not too sweet and perfect match with fried mento! And I love black pepper crab as well!

So naturally, this was on the list of must-eats during the trip. I had emailed a co-worker based in Singapore, what were some of the recommendations to eat while in the city? It's like asking a NYC local where was the best place to get pizza. She mentioned chili crab at Jumbo Seafood, and so when my wife's friend's family took us here, I was more than happy. They have several locations, but the one we went to was next to the waters. The view was fantastic, especially at night, and they had plenty of outdoor tables. It bustling with people enjoying chili crab and other local seafood.We ate a ton of food, but let's talk about the chili crab. The crab isn't your standard Dungeness crab that we're all used to in the states. They used Sri-Lankan crabs, which had huge, meaty claws. The crab meat was succulent -- nice and sweet, extremely juicy and tender. It was a like giant, delicious mutant crab.As for the chili sauce, it's hard to describe, but it's similar to the dipping sauce that Brodard uses for their pork spring rolls -- only chunkier with more crab meat inside, with a lot more complex flavors, and ton spicier. I'm talking really spicy. Maybe it was because I was practically drinking the stuff, with the help of the fried and steamed bread (man-tou) sopping up the juices. Then I washed it down with some local Tiger beer. Man, was it good. If this was in the states, I'd be a bona fide regular."

We needed to find the best place to test, to have a thorough opinion, so we poked the brains of every uber/taxi driver and local we could find. We found out everyone has a different opinion. So since we wanted to go to Clark Quey, we decided on the Jumbo at the end so we could walk through the madness afterwards. We ordered the chili crab, malay style noodles, and the little bread balls. Before I state my opinion, I have to say that I am a big fan of crab. I love Than Long, PPQ, Crawstation... and at most places, I can eat the shells clean and usually want to take a straw to the leftover broth, but I was not tempted to ask for a straw here. We were slightly disappointed in the flavor that was so hyped up by our friend. The malay noodles on the other hand...omg must get. The flavor was beautiful. The little bread balls were nice to, not necessarily necessary, but good for soaking up said chili sauce (which is not the same as sipping the broth; the bread just needed something).This location is pretty sweet and we didn't have to wait in line. You might need to sit with other people at a large round table, but it's a cool experience and you can see what other people order. The group to the right of us ordered the king crab legs, and the servers brought out the giant crab ALIVE in a basket so he could meet the people that held his fate in their stomachs before being whisked away to the hot tub. I'd go back and maybe try chili crab at another place...maybe."

On the one positive side, the seating process is efficient given that the place is run like a factory. On a busy Friday night I was seated within 10 minutes. But sadly this is the only positive thing about the restaurant. The service was appalling! I was the only one at the table who didn't have a place setting and I asked 4 times before I got one. The waitress kept mumbling under her nose. I noticed that none of the dishes on the menu had prices. I ordered one chili crab and a glass of wine. The waitress also brought peanuts and tea. I didn't love the crab but felt good about having tried it as the typical local dish. Then the bill came. It was over $120. The crab was $80 which I thought was ridiculously overpriced. I was also charged for the peanuts and tea I didn't order and also didn't touch. I was appalled. The entire experience was very unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth.

Lol maybe it's just my tender heart but I've always had a hard time with that type of display, but moving on. A lot of bareness in regards to decoration etc.We had a wait but it wasn't bad for dinner on a Saturday night. Once we were seated we went to order. I thought seafood would be easy gluten free but apparently not. I was initially told they couldn't make me anything. When my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that I could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces (it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them, even the garlic and olive oil) and the scallops and vegetables plain. My friends ordered other things. The worst part is that all these things came out and I was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for 45 mins. They finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well. We then all sat and waited. We had to ask five.. Yes five.. Times about the last crab. Me still starving. We were blown off several times. Asked to speak to a manager twice who never came. Two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat. Food was good though mine was bland as they offered no sauce options, but seafood was fresh and portions good. They also charge for everything without telling you, the peanuts on the table? Yep. The tea they bring you? Bet ur bottom $When I return to Singapore I won't be rushing back."

They have ample seating both indoors and outdoors, but wait times can be long on busy evenings. Reservations for weekends are recommended.Service is attentive and with a smile - a good balance of Singapore efficiency (that you see everywhere, including the way trees are planted on sidewalks) and hospitality; the waiters here who make sure you are taken care of without becoming too much in your face!We ordered the following - Crab with salt ad pepper - if you are a fan of good crabs, I mean really good crabs, and are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and flex your muscles in cracking crab shells, then this dish is for you. Cooked perfectly and great flavors and spices, this dish is a winner. I had to stop myself in sucking on pieces of the shell so as not to look like a hobo!Seafood noodles - well made and the shrimp and squid were cooked perfectly. Had a bit off a kick tho, but I still could not stop eating it.Farmed frogs - One of the best versions of frog legs that I have had ever. The sauce was awesome (pardon my limited repertoire of powerful English words) and stood on its own compared to the crab!a MUST try seafood restaurant when in Singapore!"

There were five of us and we ordered two crabs, one chili and one black pepper. we also ordered some noodles and veggie plate.I shared the ginormous chili crab with the birthday gal and oi was it delicious! the sauce was amazing! I thought it was going to be super spicy but it wasn't. The sauce was just perfect - spicy but not so spicy that it feels like your tongue is on fire...as a matter of fact it was very flavorful. You can enjoy both the spiciness and flavor - what's more amazing is if you dipped the bread into the sauce or even put a few spoons onto the noodles. The crab, itself was fresh and meaty. We each paid about 35 dollars...which isn't too bad honestly. I consider it pretty cheap. I would definitely want to try the pepper crab next time since this time I didn't really get to try it."

With nothing to compare it to, the crab was just OK.

One of the reasons I really like jumbos is also because you can get the cereal prawns deshelled. I'm sorry but I'm a white guy and I dont like durian and I dont like prawns with the shell on.  I find the chili crab sauce here to be a tad bit sweeter.  There are other spots that have bigger crabs but I think all around with the food, crab options and different branches all over its a pretty safe bet. In terms of this branch there is ALWAYS a wait. If youre calling for reservations the same day for dinner forget it. Otherwise you'll be eating at 10pm.  The service is not friendly but its there.  If youre a live here and you and your friends are ALWAYS taking friends/visitors to chili crab sign up for the jumbo membership:)"

It's probably just an unfounded bias that eating seafood next to the sea makes the catch more fresh?! When in reality, I know that the all of the products probably came from the same wholesaler who delivers them to each Jumbo branch. For convenience's sake, you might want to dine at the branch at Riverwalk which is at the heart of Singapore's nightlife - Clark Quay.My favorite food picks are, 1. Black pepper crab - Order the fried buns (known as ""mantous"") it's sooo good! Then dip it in the black pepper sauce :)- Expect to get your hands super duper dirty! (Definitely not a dish for the first date). They will give you some lime water to clean your hands with after the meal but the crab smell will still linger. 2. Steamed bamboo clam with garlic and vermicelli- Love it! bamboo clams taste like chewy abalone :) 3. Steamed prawns- You'd be surprise how good these prawns are even without any seasoning! They usually serve you some soya sauce with slices of red chili to dip the prawns. 4. Fried you tiao stuff with fish cake- Honestly, I did not expect to be a fan of this dish because ""you tiaos"" (fried dough strips) are sooo oily but the ones at Jumbo are crispy and golden. The fish cake inside makes it even more flavorful and savory! Perfect combination. Ambiance: Jumbo's restaurant (outdoor seating area) is overlooking the beautiful Singapore river so you get a good view of Singpore's old port (now a tourist hotspot for boat cruises). I would recommend Jumbo over the boat cruise any day!"

Of course, chilli crab is a must, and it's very good. The sauce is hot but really flavorful.  It's not quite as great of a chilli sauce as the Seafood International out by East Coast Park, but still good.  A perfect dish is the fried 'mantou' (buns); excellent dipped in the chilli sauce.  The slightly-sweet breadiness helps to cut the spice. We usually get a couple of veg dishes, too, which are pretty standard. The cereal prawns are not bad, but since then I've gotten just salt and pepper prawns instead.All in all, I will still come here if I'm meeting people in the downtown area.

First things first, this restaurant is a very tourist-y place - as our Grab driver joked with us. A bit overpriced and I'm sure you could get the same dishes elsewhere. But if it's your first time visiting, it will be a nice experience! If you didn't make a reservation in advance, prepare to wait for 40-60 minutes, especially on a busy weekend night. This location is Clarke Quay is right near other bars and restaurants - so if you get an outdoor table (like we did) you'll have a great view. However, it does get loud later into the evening. Chili crab is a must get, obviously!! It was so delicious - spicy but fragrant flavor - but make sure to get extra buns or fried rice to sop up all the yummy sauce after you finish the crab meat. Goes well with a Tiger beer or Coca Cola :)Fried shrimp was meh - wouldn't get again. Would love to come back and try other dishes!"

Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out! This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!!

We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating.

My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs."

Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!!  OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap!

We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd.

You don't need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early.Since it was only the two of us, we didn't want to order too many items. We ended up getting:-Chilli crab (OMG, so good. So messy.

I ordered a chilli crab, and while it was absolutely delicious, it would cost me about 100 SGD if I had not purchased the Klook voucher.I came here for lunch and since I was here on my own, it took about 20 minutes to get a seat without a reservation. They asked if I minded sharing a table with another party, and I said no because I knew I would get seated sooner. I was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother, so it was all pleasant.I ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab, along with the tools they provided to crack the shell. I noticed some other people were provided with gloves, and I think it's not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available. Maybe this would be something I'd be aware of if I ate more messy seafood or if I were a Singapore local?Big note: They will offer you peanuts and tea as if they don't cost extra, but they do!! So if you're trying to save some money, refuse the peanuts and tea. Just get some water (though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water).Another note: They don't have napkins or anything at the table, so if you need wet napkins, definitely call someone over to provide you with some. You will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy.Anyway, the chilli crab was very delicious; I basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too. The DIY breaking into the crab was fun but super messy. I'd probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce, but without the mess.Since I am just one person, I wasn't able to try any of the other delicious items they have. I hope I'll be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns!"

The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal.

Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer. Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab.

I'd pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is. We also ordered the ho fun, sadly I didn't take a picture of it but is really good! The gravy was very flavorful. My sister and I love the chili crab sauce  so much that we even ended up mixing it with our noodles. Finger licking, bowl slurping good."

The ambiance was amazing...the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby. You put your name in  the queue and they will call you when your table is ready. You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45.  Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in).  I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it. Morning Glory was to DIE FOR.  And their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce!It seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in Singapore so this is another good one! I enjoyed myself and left with a food coma!"

We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns. Chili crab - definitely an A+. It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade. Black pepper crab - that's a B. I have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere. Deep fried prawns in cereal - A.  The small order has generous amount of prawns. At $24 and came without the shells, that was not bad at all. This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better. Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have ""become fatter"" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab.  Service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously. So no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out Singapore's famous and very popular Chili Crab!!"

I love the flavor and savoring the sauces w a bowl of rice! we did not ask price as it's not indicated on the menu, and we were aware it was by weight so we ordered one to share along w other dishes. the razor clam was really delicious too! Overall, I like the food, although it's definitely overpriced especially the chili crab, ours came out to be over 60 SD for one small crab, as some of the yelpers mentioned, there were also shady about the price. And yes, they charged petty things like napkins, tea and peanuts!  I'd probably not want to return w such terrible manager and steep touristy price!"

Jumbo has numerous outlets across Singapore and this review is for The Riverwalk outlet. Their baby squid appetizer is a must have.They are crunchy with the right amount of sweetness. I had the herbal live Prawns, cereal prawns, mocha ribs and many other dishes. All were delicious. Service was great too as staff were very attentive. However, my dining experience was spoiled by a company having their staff dinner celebration. They were obnoxious with their loud 'yum shengs' throughout the duration I was there. While I understand it is Chinese New Year, I feel that party should have spared a thought for other diners in the restaurant. Maybe Jumbo can advise big parties to be mindful with their noise level next time as this restaurant is rather small and any noise is amplified in this enclosed airconditioned area. I talked to a service staff abt the noise disturbance and the management served my party with a complimentary dessert. A nice gesture by the management of Jumbo. While I appreciate the nice gesture, I would have preferred to enjoy my dinner without the noise disturbance. I recommend this seafood restaurant and hopefully next time, I will not be dining with large noisy groups."

So my sister and I trekked over to this location before our flight. Luckily for us, there was no wait! I think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in - it got really busy as we were eating. The chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns. I noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people (150 SGD) which included a variety of items. Although the price tag was steep, who knew when we would be back in Singapore! We took the plunge and I would say I am pretty happy with our decision. We were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda, dragonfruit lobster salad, fried rice with egg, cereal prawns, chili crab, and a pomelo sago dessert. I loved the lychee soda - refreshing and not too sweet. My least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad - it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo. The fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion (I think this could have been enough for 4 people)!The star of the show, the chili crab, was DELICIOUS! The crab meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was not as spicy as I thought it would be - in fact, it was pretty sweet. However, it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce. I also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal! Sounds weird but it was yummy! We ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago. I would give Jumbo Seafood five stars if not for the spotty service. The girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming. The waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly, but service was very slow."

Chilli Crab is expensive, I get it, but the quantity we got just wasn't the best for the price we paid. Other than that, though, now that that is out of the way, the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use. The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce. Would still recommend coming to this place if you've never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab, but I won't be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality:value ratio of Singapore's National Dish."

When we finally got a seat we ordered the benchmark Chili Crab,  kang kong sambal, and scallops in purple yam. We also ordered the Lychee Italian soda and the green apple Italian soda. The drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined. I wasn't drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab. The crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection. I wish I had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone. The crab was fresh and good. The kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good. Second piece of advice, the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce. The bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab. Would eat again with more folks to feel less guilty."

Keep in mind that there is one right across from Clark Quay that we got this location confused with - so we ended up being slightly late for our lunch reservation here. That said, we were able to get a seat inside easily enough, although by the time we had left, the restaurant was quite packed for a weekday lunch. Service was pretty quick and easy, although one of the menu items we wanted was not available despite it being early on in the day...a bit puzzling, but not a dealbreaker. The drink selection has a lot of juices, but the alcoholic selections (beer and wine) are a bit on the light side.The crabs themselves...they are huge, but they are very tasty as well. For someone who is a bit less experienced at pulling apart seafood, I made an abject mess of it (thankfully, there are wet wipes and plenty of extra napkins provided), but the meat was fresh and infused with the delicious fragrance and taste of red chilis. One could be forgiven for thinking that the crabs were swimming in chili oil before being cooked. Be prepared to fight for the meat, though; it takes a lot of patience, and you have to watch our for the sharper edges on the shell once your hands are slippery from the oil. Outside of that, though, the rest of the meal was very standard-issue Chinese food, and given the premium the restaurant places on the crab, everything else is pretty overpriced in comparison. The fish maw soup I had here was definitely worse than I have had in China (or in Chinatown in NYC), and it was quite a bit more expensive. The mushroom tofu dish we got as our other side was similarly bland and uninspiring, but it set us back nearly S$20 (possibly more).The crab lives up to the hype, and I would come back just to eat that alone. But the rest of the meal was overpriced mediocrity, to put it bluntly - unfortunately, the magic that comes along with the crab isn't really present on any of the other dishes."

I was told I must make a reservation and was glad for the advice when i realized i couldn't get in for a couple days. This location was less busy than the one just up the river at riverside. Overall my experience was just ok. The service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i hadn't ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it (I guess its like up selling) I told them I did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items (so they were going to charge me!) I was also by myself and was brought a rather large crab ($61) I probably should have requested something smaller but didn't think that was the way they worked here. The Chili crab was ok, but I won't go out of my way to try again. I would say this is a great place to try Chili or pepper crab if you are visiting, but once is enough."

We had one chili crab and one pepper crab for five people. Soooo good. also some fried noodles, spinach with garlic, prawns with some kind of sweet, dry crust on them (wish I could remember the name) and of course, buns to soak up the sauces. Plenty of pitchers of cold Tiger beer to round out the meal. Reservations are highly recommended as it is crowded every night. On the border of Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Service is efficient, lots of people refilling glasses, getting more beer. Not overly friendly but that's not really an issue, you'll be too busy chowing down to care. Highly recommended"

We went after getting repeated recommendation/vouches for the jumbo seafood as the ""go to"" place to try Singaporean chili crab even though at first we were hesitant due to the fact that it was a chain joint. However, despite a bit of difficulty getting reservation (we used the app Chope) and slowness in service, I have to say the food itself was AMAZING! :) For the two of us, we ordered 1 veggie dish sautéed in garlic sauce and one chili crab and they were both a pure delicacy! We got medium spiciness and was just perfectly sauced, spiced, cooked/steamed and cracked  (to be eaten easily). What a joy! We then proceeded to order a Pepper crab which was warmed in delicious butter and exotic black pepper and it was like experiencing a whole new world, a world's apart journey in flavor from the chili crab. Yum!! I'd recommend both since they are very different, but if I had to choose one, would probably go with the classic (chili crab). Also beware that the crabs are not cheap - about $70 SGD a piece - so be prepared to spend some $$$ if you're willing to adventure on trying both! Next time I definitely want to try their buns to dip it in the chili sauce as well as the fried rice! Also I'd highly recommend this location located by the beautifully lit Singapore River as it's only a short walk to all the beautiful sights and sceneries by the water as well as the Fullerton Hotels and the Merlion :)"

What tainted our experience was the hostess at the other Jumbo location on Merchant road (not sure where this review most appropriately fits). Being tourists, our cab dropped us off at the Merchant road location, right in time for our reservation at the Riverwalk. Once they let us know we were in the wrong spot, we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way. The hostess said she would not. Having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess, and she reminded us we had 10 minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away. Eventually, the food was good. I have never had chili crab, and thought it was okay. The fried buns are a bit greasy, I would stick with the regular ones. The food is pricey as expected.

Minor thing to call out, they put peanuts on the table for snacking before the meal comes out, you think it's free but there's a small charge.  I've also heard they sometimes charge for the napkins (which you'll need) so ask before taking a big stack.  Overall, this place is slightly price given it's a chain restaurant but it was a good meal!Make sure to call for a reservation.  We had a 7pm rez and had until 8:30 to finish, I didn't feel rushed but I'm sure they would have notified us had we overstayed out time.  There's another location just a short walk on the Clarke Quay Riverside walk so make sure to go to the right location."

Maybe it is the mess where everyone just digs in using our hands and fingers, trying to pry the sweet meat from the shells. Bibs are now provided so you don't get gravy stains on your tops. The must order dish is the chili crab, plus the fried mini buns (mantous) to soak up the addictive spicy sweet chili gravy. The rest is an afterthought. The food is generally decent but for the fried rice and hor fun, they lacked the wok hei flavor of tze char. Sambal kang kong, fried tofu, cereal prawns and the likes are just ok or average. The service is fast and there are two seatings. The first is from 5.45pm to 7.45pm and with the speedy way they served the dishes, our two tables were done within 90 minutes. Lots of eating and less talking I guess. Getting to the place is a bit of a hassle, if you have elderly or those who can't walk well in your dining party, as they are plenty of steps to navigate.

My friend and I came here to try their crab around 9:30pm. Our waitress told us they only have one last Alaskan king crab left that would cost about $600. Our first reaction was holy &$@/. We even asked her if she was sure if that was the only type of crab left and if we could get any other type of smaller crab, but she promised us that it was the last one and even spoke to the back with her transponder to ""save the LAST crab for me"". She even promised us that it would not be too much for 2 people. I thought it was weird that this place would run out of its signature dish so quick, but since I'm only here for 2 days, I decided to get it.Then as more customers came and ordered smaller crabs, we called her over to question her and she denied everything and saying she only said that was the last Alaskan crab. Now I would forgive her if we didn't ask her 3 times to make sure that was the last of any crab and if she didn't quote ""save the LAST CRAB for me""...They also charge everything from peanuts to water, and they WON'T tell you unless you ask. So definitely watch out for that since they bring out the peanut to you without you asking for it like it was free."

The photos of the food on the menu did NOT match what arrived in several cases.  The low quantity and low quality of the food for the high price charged was simply outrageous.  They seemed more interested in upselling alcohol than serving food, once they knew you weren't going to be drinkers, the wait-staff ignored us for quite a while before coming back to place our order.  When the food was ready, it was rushed to the table in an effort to turn the table as soon as possible.  They charged $78.00 for a single chopped up crab (a/k/a crab bits) was more than a bit pricey for what you got. For $22.00 you get a 3-cm cube of codfish. Six tiny scallops surrounded by an enormous amount of yam cost $18, again not worth the price and they tasted oily.Maybe they were good at one time, that's not the case any more -- at least not tonight, and for a bill over $200.00, you'd expect that you'd get quality service and quality food with a hand-wash facility for patrons and staff that had the basic necessities. All-in-all, I have nothing positive to say about this place and need to simply state that this seems to be an expensive, low-quality tourist trap for those that don't know any better.  Avoid at all costs and seek Singapore Chilli Crab elsewhere -- ask a LOCAL.  We'll never return."

For sides we had greens at almost 12 USD, and the portion was tiiiiny. Do not accept the peanuts they try to give you when you first sit down. They will charge you. You are given one measly towellete to use. How is this possible when you have to dig in with your hands???I guess you are paying for the view and location?

BUT, you get a yummy sauce for some bread with the chili option, so depends if you're in a dippin' mood or not. I gave it 3-stars mostly because the service was very very average. Everyone around us seemed to be taken care of, while we felt ignored for 90% of our meal. I realize the service-standard is completely different in the US of A compared to many parts of the world, but it was enough to make us leave in a hurry.

Even with a reservation on a weeknight, we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. But once we sat down it didn't take long for them to take our order and deliver our starters.The drunken shrimp tasted exactly like I thought it would, in a flavorful broth with a hint of liquor. The pepper crab tasted like pepper crab should. I'm always amazed at how they can get the meat to taste all peppery even though the crab shell is tough to break through! And of course, the granddaddy of them all- chilli crab. I liked this version a lot because it did have a little kick to it, but not to the point where I was sweating balls.The service was good, even though the restaurant was fully booked. I also found it kid friendly, as our table did have a toddler, there were other smaller kids at the tables nearby us, and none of the other diners seemed to mind. Perhaps it's because we're all wearing bibs, given how messy crab can get, so we all look like children anyway.Overall, a solid place to bring tourists (or just your local selves!) to experience Singaporean realness. Just remember that this location is NOT to be mistaken for ""Riverside Point"", which is located in the heart of Clarke Quay. I made that mistake while reserving, since this location is called ""The Riverwalk"". But no worries, as they are only about a 5-7 minute walk apart."

The shells on those crabs are so thick you almost need a small hammer in addition to the cracker. The little fried buns they give you are great to soak up the sauce the crab if floating in. The pepper crab was okay. Peppery. Totally outdone by the chili crab.The egg custard shrimp were delicious. The whole peking duck was wonderful. They prepare the whole thing- bring it table side and then skin it in front of you - Wrapping the bits of crispy skin into crepes with cucumber, green onion and a bit of sauce. Yummy! Then take the duck back and roast it again and bring it to you de-boned and sliced. The seafood fried rice was a bit on the salty side.The venison was very tender, not gamey at all and almost buttery. Both dining experiences were great and I'd say this is a must go - local or tourist :)"

What is the name of this delicious dish?

Not too sweet and perfect match with fried mento! And I love black pepper crab as well!

So naturally, this was on the list of must-eats during the trip. I had emailed a co-worker based in Singapore, what were some of the recommendations to eat while in the city? It's like asking a NYC local where was the best place to get pizza. She mentioned chili crab at Jumbo Seafood, and so when my wife's friend's family took us here, I was more than happy. They have several locations, but the one we went to was next to the waters. The view was fantastic, especially at night, and they had plenty of outdoor tables. It bustling with people enjoying chili crab and other local seafood.We ate a ton of food, but let's talk about the chili crab. The crab isn't your standard Dungeness crab that we're all used to in the states. They used Sri-Lankan crabs, which had huge, meaty claws. The crab meat was succulent -- nice and sweet, extremely juicy and tender. It was a like giant, delicious mutant crab.As for the chili sauce, it's hard to describe, but it's similar to the dipping sauce that Brodard uses for their pork spring rolls -- only chunkier with more crab meat inside, with a lot more complex flavors, and ton spicier. I'm talking really spicy. Maybe it was because I was practically drinking the stuff, with the help of the fried and steamed bread (man-tou) sopping up the juices. Then I washed it down with some local Tiger beer. Man, was it good. If this was in the states, I'd be a bona fide regular."

We needed to find the best place to test, to have a thorough opinion, so we poked the brains of every uber/taxi driver and local we could find. We found out everyone has a different opinion. So since we wanted to go to Clark Quey, we decided on the Jumbo at the end so we could walk through the madness afterwards. We ordered the chili crab, malay style noodles, and the little bread balls. Before I state my opinion, I have to say that I am a big fan of crab. I love Than Long, PPQ, Crawstation... and at most places, I can eat the shells clean and usually want to take a straw to the leftover broth, but I was not tempted to ask for a straw here. We were slightly disappointed in the flavor that was so hyped up by our friend. The malay noodles on the other hand...omg must get. The flavor was beautiful. The little bread balls were nice to, not necessarily necessary, but good for soaking up said chili sauce (which is not the same as sipping the broth; the bread just needed something).This location is pretty sweet and we didn't have to wait in line. You might need to sit with other people at a large round table, but it's a cool experience and you can see what other people order. The group to the right of us ordered the king crab legs, and the servers brought out the giant crab ALIVE in a basket so he could meet the people that held his fate in their stomachs before being whisked away to the hot tub. I'd go back and maybe try chili crab at another place...maybe."

On the one positive side, the seating process is efficient given that the place is run like a factory. On a busy Friday night I was seated within 10 minutes. But sadly this is the only positive thing about the restaurant. The service was appalling! I was the only one at the table who didn't have a place setting and I asked 4 times before I got one. The waitress kept mumbling under her nose. I noticed that none of the dishes on the menu had prices. I ordered one chili crab and a glass of wine. The waitress also brought peanuts and tea. I didn't love the crab but felt good about having tried it as the typical local dish. Then the bill came. It was over $120. The crab was $80 which I thought was ridiculously overpriced. I was also charged for the peanuts and tea I didn't order and also didn't touch. I was appalled. The entire experience was very unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth.

A lot of bareness in regards to decoration etc.We had a wait but it wasn't bad for dinner on a Saturday night. Once we were seated we went to order. I thought seafood would be easy gluten free but apparently not. I was initially told they couldn't make me anything. When my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that I could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces (it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them, even the garlic and olive oil) and the scallops and vegetables plain. My friends ordered other things. The worst part is that all these things came out and I was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for 45 mins. They finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well. We then all sat and waited. We had to ask five.. Yes five.. Times about the last crab. Me still starving. We were blown off several times. Asked to speak to a manager twice who never came. Two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat. Food was good though mine was bland as they offered no sauce options, but seafood was fresh and portions good. They also charge for everything without telling you, the peanuts on the table? Yep. The tea they bring you? Bet ur bottom $When I return to Singapore I won't be rushing back."

This location is Clarke Quay is right near other bars and restaurants - so if you get an outdoor table (like we did) you'll have a great view. However, it does get loud later into the evening. Chili crab is a must get, obviously!! It was so delicious - spicy but fragrant flavor - but make sure to get extra buns or fried rice to sop up all the yummy sauce after you finish the crab meat.

There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off. There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating. Nothing really wow'ed us, we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid. Honestly, every hawker stand we tried, the food was SO good! Being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip, we were slightly bitter and disappointed."

My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs."

I was sooo excited to come, and I have to say, by far, it is the best crab I've ever had in my life!!The sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut. I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!! During the past 5 months, I have tried a couple of Malaysian and Chinese restaurants in the Northeast and haven't found anything that was close to this!! I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!!  OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive. I still love my chilly crab and want to come back to Singapore for this, but next time, my bf for sure will just watch me eat!!!"

We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored."

I ordered a chilli crab, and while it was absolutely delicious, it would cost me about 100 SGD if I had not purchased the Klook voucher.I came here for lunch and since I was here on my own, it took about 20 minutes to get a seat without a reservation. They asked if I minded sharing a table with another party, and I said no because I knew I would get seated sooner. I was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother, so it was all pleasant.I ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab, along with the tools they provided to crack the shell. I noticed some other people were provided with gloves, and I think it's not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available. Maybe this would be something I'd be aware of if I ate more messy seafood or if I were a Singapore local?Big note: They will offer you peanuts and tea as if they don't cost extra, but they do!! So if you're trying to save some money, refuse the peanuts and tea. Just get some water (though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water).Another note: They don't have napkins or anything at the table, so if you need wet napkins, definitely call someone over to provide you with some. You will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy.Anyway, the chilli crab was very delicious; I basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too. The DIY breaking into the crab was fun but super messy. I'd probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce, but without the mess.Since I am just one person, I wasn't able to try any of the other delicious items they have. I hope I'll be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns!"

The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal. When I saw this on the menu, I thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp, but when the dish came, I saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp! Luckily, the crispy, sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal, even eaten on its own!"

I would opt out of the fried rice and order extra buns instead. The chilli sauce is scrumptious. You would want to eat it all up. We got lucky and were able to walk in without a reservation. We sat outside while it was lightly drizzling, but we were not uncomfortable at all. The outdoor part of the restaurant had umbrellas to shield us from the rain, and the waiters provided covers to protect our belongings."

Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer. Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab. If you're willing to deal with the steep prices (they charge for everything including the peanuts and wipes), the lackluster service and are lucky enough to score a reservation in the air conditioned section, you will be treated to a very tasty meal."

My sister and I got one crab to share which was more than enough. It's truly the sauce that makes this dish so great. I love tomatoes, anything tomato based I'm typically a fan right off the bat and their sauce has a tomato-y base that is sweet and spicy and so addicting! I'd pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is. We also ordered the ho fun, sadly I didn't take a picture of it but is really good! The gravy was very flavorful.

You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45.  Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in).  I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it.

We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns. Chili crab - definitely an A+. It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade. Black pepper crab - that's a B. I have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere. Deep fried prawns in cereal - A.  The small order has generous amount of prawns. At $24 and came without the shells, that was not bad at all. This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better. Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have ""become fatter"" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab.  Service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously. So no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out Singapore's famous and very popular Chili Crab!!"

It tasted more like ketchup and sweetness than a savoury food which was really disappointing. The rice and buns were okay. Maybe because the location was in a very central location, which was why it was busier and more expensive?

I had the herbal live Prawns, cereal prawns, mocha ribs and many other dishes. All were delicious. Service was great too as staff were very attentive. However, my dining experience was spoiled by a company having their staff dinner celebration. They were obnoxious with their loud 'yum shengs' throughout the duration I was there. While I understand it is Chinese New Year, I feel that party should have spared a thought for other diners in the restaurant. Maybe Jumbo can advise big parties to be mindful with their noise level next time as this restaurant is rather small and any noise is amplified in this enclosed airconditioned area. I talked to a service staff abt the noise disturbance and the management served my party with a complimentary dessert. A nice gesture by the management of Jumbo. While I appreciate the nice gesture, I would have preferred to enjoy my dinner without the noise disturbance. I recommend this seafood restaurant and hopefully next time, I will not be dining with large noisy groups."

So my sister and I trekked over to this location before our flight. Luckily for us, there was no wait! I think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in - it got really busy as we were eating. The chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns. I noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people (150 SGD) which included a variety of items. Although the price tag was steep, who knew when we would be back in Singapore! We took the plunge and I would say I am pretty happy with our decision. We were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda, dragonfruit lobster salad, fried rice with egg, cereal prawns, chili crab, and a pomelo sago dessert. I loved the lychee soda - refreshing and not too sweet. My least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad - it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo. The fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion (I think this could have been enough for 4 people)!The star of the show, the chili crab, was DELICIOUS! The crab meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was not as spicy as I thought it would be - in fact, it was pretty sweet. However, it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce. I also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal! Sounds weird but it was yummy! We ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago. I would give Jumbo Seafood five stars if not for the spotty service. The girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming. The waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly, but service was very slow."

The drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined. I wasn't drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab. The crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection. I wish I had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone. The crab was fresh and good. The kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good. Second piece of advice, the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce. The bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab.

Keep in mind that there is one right across from Clark Quay that we got this location confused with - so we ended up being slightly late for our lunch reservation here. That said, we were able to get a seat inside easily enough, although by the time we had left, the restaurant was quite packed for a weekday lunch. Service was pretty quick and easy, although one of the menu items we wanted was not available despite it being early on in the day...a bit puzzling, but not a dealbreaker. The drink selection has a lot of juices, but the alcoholic selections (beer and wine) are a bit on the light side.The crabs themselves...they are huge, but they are very tasty as well. For someone who is a bit less experienced at pulling apart seafood, I made an abject mess of it (thankfully, there are wet wipes and plenty of extra napkins provided), but the meat was fresh and infused with the delicious fragrance and taste of red chilis. One could be forgiven for thinking that the crabs were swimming in chili oil before being cooked. Be prepared to fight for the meat, though; it takes a lot of patience, and you have to watch our for the sharper edges on the shell once your hands are slippery from the oil. Outside of that, though, the rest of the meal was very standard-issue Chinese food, and given the premium the restaurant places on the crab, everything else is pretty overpriced in comparison. The fish maw soup I had here was definitely worse than I have had in China (or in Chinatown in NYC), and it was quite a bit more expensive. The mushroom tofu dish we got as our other side was similarly bland and uninspiring, but it set us back nearly S$20 (possibly more).The crab lives up to the hype, and I would come back just to eat that alone. But the rest of the meal was overpriced mediocrity, to put it bluntly - unfortunately, the magic that comes along with the crab isn't really present on any of the other dishes."

Someone bring buns and put on their common table then my server comes and serve them to customers.  So fucking ridiculous. Why not serve buns to me directly.  So my bun was there in front of me and I had to wait for fucking 10min to get this cold bun.Besides customers nearby me ordered bun and they forgot and asked them again like in 15min. Love dish but attitude and efficiency need to be improved here.  I wont come back and will keep going to the one in Ion Orchard.

The service was notably great. They were attentive, efficient, mindful of the number of guests in our party, and quick to keep us updated on the status of our cooking crabs. One manager even went out of his way to convince us NOT to order so much. He saved us $100 and a night of misery. That was very hospitable and ethical of him. FoodOMG. If crab was meant to be served and eaten by gods, then there ought to be no other way to serve or eat crab than this. The perfect balance of sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy. I don't know how else to describe the succulent taste that enraptures your taste buds. We ordered both the Chili Crab and the Blk Pepper Crab. Both excellent. But above I am speaking of the Chili crab. EnvironmentExcellent location. The restaurant is always jamming. But they do a good and efficient job of spacing everyone apart.

It's dry compare to the chili crab, there's no sauce but it's more intense and flavorful to me!It's about ~$90SGD/crab after tax for the smallest size you can pick.I ordered some other rice dish and vegetable dish because some of my family dont eat seafood, the dishes were ok but definitely not worth the price.Again, come here for the crab and you will not be disappointed!Tips: Line/queue might be long, so try to make reservation before you come!"

Overall my experience was just ok. The service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i hadn't ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it (I guess its like up selling) I told them I did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items (so they were going to charge me!) I was also by myself and was brought a rather large crab ($61) I probably should have requested something smaller but didn't think that was the way they worked here.

We had one chili crab and one pepper crab for five people. Soooo good. also some fried noodles, spinach with garlic, prawns with some kind of sweet, dry crust on them (wish I could remember the name) and of course, buns to soak up the sauces.

We went after getting repeated recommendation/vouches for the jumbo seafood as the ""go to"" place to try Singaporean chili crab even though at first we were hesitant due to the fact that it was a chain joint. However, despite a bit of difficulty getting reservation (we used the app Chope) and slowness in service, I have to say the food itself was AMAZING! :) For the two of us, we ordered 1 veggie dish sautéed in garlic sauce and one chili crab and they were both a pure delicacy! We got medium spiciness and was just perfectly sauced, spiced, cooked/steamed and cracked  (to be eaten easily). What a joy! We then proceeded to order a Pepper crab which was warmed in delicious butter and exotic black pepper and it was like experiencing a whole new world, a world's apart journey in flavor from the chili crab. Yum!! I'd recommend both since they are very different, but if I had to choose one, would probably go with the classic (chili crab). Also beware that the crabs are not cheap - about $70 SGD a piece - so be prepared to spend some $$$ if you're willing to adventure on trying both! Next time I definitely want to try their buns to dip it in the chili sauce as well as the fried rice! Also I'd highly recommend this location located by the beautifully lit Singapore River as it's only a short walk to all the beautiful sights and sceneries by the water as well as the Fullerton Hotels and the Merlion :)"

What tainted our experience was the hostess at the other Jumbo location on Merchant road (not sure where this review most appropriately fits). Being tourists, our cab dropped us off at the Merchant road location, right in time for our reservation at the Riverwalk. Once they let us know we were in the wrong spot, we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way. The hostess said she would not. Having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess, and she reminded us we had 10 minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away. Eventually, the food was good. I have never had chili crab, and thought it was okay. The fried buns are a bit greasy, I would stick with the regular ones. The food is pricey as expected.

Minor thing to call out, they put peanuts on the table for snacking before the meal comes out, you think it's free but there's a small charge.  I've also heard they sometimes charge for the napkins (which you'll need) so ask before taking a big stack.  Overall, this place is slightly price given it's a chain restaurant but it was a good meal!Make sure to call for a reservation.  We had a 7pm rez and had until 8:30 to finish, I didn't feel rushed but I'm sure they would have notified us had we overstayed out time.  There's another location just a short walk on the Clarke Quay Riverside walk so make sure to go to the right location."

This is the go-to place for the extended family, especially when relatives are here from overseas. Somehow there is something about eating crabs which brings the family closer. Maybe it is the mess where everyone just digs in using our hands and fingers, trying to pry the sweet meat from the shells. Bibs are now provided so you don't get gravy stains on your tops. The must order dish is the chili crab, plus the fried mini buns (mantous) to soak up the addictive spicy sweet chili gravy. The rest is an afterthought. The food is generally decent but for the fried rice and hor fun, they lacked the wok hei flavor of tze char. Sambal kang kong, fried tofu, cereal prawns and the likes are just ok or average. The service is fast and there are two seatings. The first is from 5.45pm to 7.45pm and with the speedy way they served the dishes, our two tables were done within 90 minutes. Lots of eating and less talking I guess. Getting to the place is a bit of a hassle, if you have elderly or those who can't walk well in your dining party, as they are plenty of steps to navigate. Parking is available at The Riverwalk (turn into Upper Circular Road) or at the URA parking lot behind. I much prefer Dempsey location which is equally crowded."

Every local will have their own favorite spot. We chose this place since it was most convenient and we were walking along Boat Quay. Eating crab can be quite messy and that is why I chose a nice sit down restaurant with white tablecloths. If you haven't figured this out, most food places (food court, hawker centres, etc.) don't provide napkins. I really appreciated the cloth napkins, bowl of water and lemon, and the large sink right outside their bathrooms.Since my foodie friend was still recovering from food poisoning, she only could eat the steamed mantou. :( So I ended up eating the whole chili crab and finishing it all by myself! :D It was delicious!The seafood was fresh. Service was very quick and efficient. The restaurant was clean and empty at 2pm.FYI: There is free wifi nearby (but weak signal). If you can, they have a promo going on that if you ""Like"" them on Facebook you'll get a free drink! :) Check their website for more specials!Nearest MRT station: Clarke Quay"

We even asked her if she was sure if that was the only type of crab left and if we could get any other type of smaller crab, but she promised us that it was the last one and even spoke to the back with her transponder to ""save the LAST crab for me"". She even promised us that it would not be too much for 2 people. I thought it was weird that this place would run out of its signature dish so quick, but since I'm only here for 2 days, I decided to get it.Then as more customers came and ordered smaller crabs, we called her over to question her and she denied everything and saying she only said that was the last Alaskan crab.

The photos of the food on the menu did NOT match what arrived in several cases.  The low quantity and low quality of the food for the high price charged was simply outrageous.  They seemed more interested in upselling alcohol than serving food, once they knew you weren't going to be drinkers, the wait-staff ignored us for quite a while before coming back to place our order.  When the food was ready, it was rushed to the table in an effort to turn the table as soon as possible.  They charged $78.00 for a single chopped up crab (a/k/a crab bits) was more than a bit pricey for what you got. For $22.00 you get a 3-cm cube of codfish. Six tiny scallops surrounded by an enormous amount of yam cost $18, again not worth the price and they tasted oily.Maybe they were good at one time, that's not the case any more -- at least not tonight, and for a bill over $200.00, you'd expect that you'd get quality service and quality food with a hand-wash facility for patrons and staff that had the basic necessities. All-in-all, I have nothing positive to say about this place and need to simply state that this seems to be an expensive, low-quality tourist trap for those that don't know any better.  Avoid at all costs and seek Singapore Chilli Crab elsewhere -- ask a LOCAL.  We'll never return."

Especially after watching so many videos about it. Needless to say i should have payed attention to the fact only asians were on the videos. I had a 7pm reservation. Not even 2 minutes after being seated i was being rushed to order. I politely asked the waitress for a few minutes to look over the menu. 10 minutes later a new waitress comes and ask for my order. As i am trying to order my food she kept saying ""thats too much for you"" to everything. I asked aee you speaking of the portions or the price. I was well aware of what i would be spending. I am not a budget traveler. She did not answer and walked off. I payed for my tea with another waitress and walked out."

Even with a reservation on a weeknight, we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. But once we sat down it didn't take long for them to take our order and deliver our starters.The drunken shrimp tasted exactly like I thought it would, in a flavorful broth with a hint of liquor. The pepper crab tasted like pepper crab should. I'm always amazed at how they can get the meat to taste all peppery even though the crab shell is tough to break through! And of course, the granddaddy of them all- chilli crab. I liked this version a lot because it did have a little kick to it, but not to the point where I was sweating balls.The service was good, even though the restaurant was fully booked. I also found it kid friendly, as our table did have a toddler, there were other smaller kids at the tables nearby us, and none of the other diners seemed to mind. Perhaps it's because we're all wearing bibs, given how messy crab can get, so we all look like children anyway.Overall, a solid place to bring tourists (or just your local selves!) to experience Singaporean realness. Just remember that this location is NOT to be mistaken for ""Riverside Point"", which is located in the heart of Clarke Quay. I made that mistake while reserving, since this location is called ""The Riverwalk"". But no worries, as they are only about a 5-7 minute walk apart."

The shells on those crabs are so thick you almost need a small hammer in addition to the cracker. The little fried buns they give you are great to soak up the sauce the crab if floating in. The pepper crab was okay. Peppery. Totally outdone by the chili crab.The egg custard shrimp were delicious. The whole peking duck was wonderful. They prepare the whole thing- bring it table side and then skin it in front of you - Wrapping the bits of crispy skin into crepes with cucumber, green onion and a bit of sauce. Yummy! Then take the duck back and roast it again and bring it to you de-boned and sliced. The seafood fried rice was a bit on the salty side.The venison was very tender, not gamey at all and almost buttery. Both dining experiences were great and I'd say this is a must go - local or tourist :)"

Marcus L and his girlfriend did the ordering and soon we had the plastic bibs on and red chill sauce stained in a glove shape all over our hands.We ate a lot of great food, my favourite was the crab, though I think when you have such beautiful crab meat it's a shame to cover up its delicate and exquisite taste with an overwhelming chilli sauce, I would have much preferred it just steamed and eaten it cold without any seasoning or sauce, but I think I'm a seafood purist when it comes to crabs.I also loved the dish which is tiles of cooked fish and prawn paste and topped tightly with a chicken skin. What is the name of this delicious dish? Jumbo was expensive, even by Perth's extortionate standard, but it's 'the best' and right on the water so I guess that's to be expected.Book ahead to get a table inside in the air-con!"

So naturally, this was on the list of must-eats during the trip. I had emailed a co-worker based in Singapore, what were some of the recommendations to eat while in the city? It's like asking a NYC local where was the best place to get pizza. She mentioned chili crab at Jumbo Seafood, and so when my wife's friend's family took us here, I was more than happy. They have several locations, but the one we went to was next to the waters. The view was fantastic, especially at night, and they had plenty of outdoor tables. It bustling with people enjoying chili crab and other local seafood.We ate a ton of food, but let's talk about the chili crab. The crab isn't your standard Dungeness crab that we're all used to in the states. They used Sri-Lankan crabs, which had huge, meaty claws. The crab meat was succulent -- nice and sweet, extremely juicy and tender. It was a like giant, delicious mutant crab.As for the chili sauce, it's hard to describe, but it's similar to the dipping sauce that Brodard uses for their pork spring rolls -- only chunkier with more crab meat inside, with a lot more complex flavors, and ton spicier. I'm talking really spicy. Maybe it was because I was practically drinking the stuff, with the help of the fried and steamed bread (man-tou) sopping up the juices. Then I washed it down with some local Tiger beer. Man, was it good. If this was in the states, I'd be a bona fide regular."

We needed to find the best place to test, to have a thorough opinion, so we poked the brains of every uber/taxi driver and local we could find. We found out everyone has a different opinion. So since we wanted to go to Clark Quey, we decided on the Jumbo at the end so we could walk through the madness afterwards. We ordered the chili crab, malay style noodles, and the little bread balls. Before I state my opinion, I have to say that I am a big fan of crab. I love Than Long, PPQ, Crawstation... and at most places, I can eat the shells clean and usually want to take a straw to the leftover broth, but I was not tempted to ask for a straw here. We were slightly disappointed in the flavor that was so hyped up by our friend. The malay noodles on the other hand...omg must get. The flavor was beautiful. The little bread balls were nice to, not necessarily necessary, but good for soaking up said chili sauce (which is not the same as sipping the broth; the bread just needed something).This location is pretty sweet and we didn't have to wait in line. You might need to sit with other people at a large round table, but it's a cool experience and you can see what other people order. The group to the right of us ordered the king crab legs, and the servers brought out the giant crab ALIVE in a basket so he could meet the people that held his fate in their stomachs before being whisked away to the hot tub. I'd go back and maybe try chili crab at another place...maybe."

But sadly this is the only positive thing about the restaurant. The service was appalling! I was the only one at the table who didn't have a place setting and I asked 4 times before I got one. The waitress kept mumbling under her nose. I noticed that none of the dishes on the menu had prices. I ordered one chili crab and a glass of wine. The waitress also brought peanuts and tea. I didn't love the crab but felt good about having tried it as the typical local dish. Then the bill came. It was over $120. The crab was $80 which I thought was ridiculously overpriced.

When my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that I could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces (it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them, even the garlic and olive oil) and the scallops and vegetables plain. My friends ordered other things. The worst part is that all these things came out and I was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for 45 mins. They finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well. We then all sat and waited. We had to ask five.. Yes five.. Times about the last crab. Me still starving. We were blown off several times. Asked to speak to a manager twice who never came. Two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat.

Reservations for weekends are recommended.Service is attentive and with a smile - a good balance of Singapore efficiency (that you see everywhere, including the way trees are planted on sidewalks) and hospitality; the waiters here who make sure you are taken care of without becoming too much in your face!We ordered the following - Crab with salt ad pepper - if you are a fan of good crabs, I mean really good crabs, and are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and flex your muscles in cracking crab shells, then this dish is for you. Cooked perfectly and great flavors and spices, this dish is a winner. I had to stop myself in sucking on pieces of the shell so as not to look like a hobo!Seafood noodles - well made and the shrimp and squid were cooked perfectly. Had a bit off a kick tho, but I still could not stop eating it.Farmed frogs - One of the best versions of frog legs that I have had ever. The sauce was awesome (pardon my limited repertoire of powerful English words) and stood on its own compared to the crab!a MUST try seafood restaurant when in Singapore!"

There were five of us and we ordered two crabs, one chili and one black pepper. we also ordered some noodles and veggie plate.I shared the ginormous chili crab with the birthday gal and oi was it delicious! the sauce was amazing! I thought it was going to be super spicy but it wasn't. The sauce was just perfect - spicy but not so spicy that it feels like your tongue is on fire...as a matter of fact it was very flavorful. You can enjoy both the spiciness and flavor - what's more amazing is if you dipped the bread into the sauce or even put a few spoons onto the noodles. The crab, itself was fresh and meaty. We each paid about 35 dollars...which isn't too bad honestly. I consider it pretty cheap. I would definitely want to try the pepper crab next time since this time I didn't really get to try it."

The chili crab, I found the sauce to be too ""gooey"", not for me, to each his own. I also ordered other items like Mee Goreng noodles, VERY good and spicy. The seafood fried rice was also very good. Overall the service was fast and typical for a place like this. Surprisingly, they have some good white wines that pair very well with the spicy dishes. Recommended."

They did put a 75 min time limit on my meal, which was a first but something I actually found very efficient! Service was excellent -- I received constant attention. I'm still getting used to the lack of napkins in Singapore, so that was an adjustment -- Bibb, plastic gloves, finger bowls and wet wipes, but no napkins for a very messy meal. With nothing to compare it to, the crab was just OK. I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow my mind and leave me salivating to return (though perhaps Chili Crab in general just isn't tasty enough for me to yearn for it, especially at the price -- which was very comparative for chili crab in Singapore).

I'm sorry but I'm a white guy and I dont like durian and I dont like prawns with the shell on.  I find the chili crab sauce here to be a tad bit sweeter.  There are other spots that have bigger crabs but I think all around with the food, crab options and different branches all over its a pretty safe bet. In terms of this branch there is ALWAYS a wait. If youre calling for reservations the same day for dinner forget it.

It's probably just an unfounded bias that eating seafood next to the sea makes the catch more fresh?! When in reality, I know that the all of the products probably came from the same wholesaler who delivers them to each Jumbo branch. For convenience's sake, you might want to dine at the branch at Riverwalk which is at the heart of Singapore's nightlife - Clark Quay.My favorite food picks are, 1. Black pepper crab - Order the fried buns (known as ""mantous"") it's sooo good! Then dip it in the black pepper sauce :)- Expect to get your hands super duper dirty! (Definitely not a dish for the first date). They will give you some lime water to clean your hands with after the meal but the crab smell will still linger. 2. Steamed bamboo clam with garlic and vermicelli- Love it! bamboo clams taste like chewy abalone :) 3. Steamed prawns- You'd be surprise how good these prawns are even without any seasoning! They usually serve you some soya sauce with slices of red chili to dip the prawns. 4. Fried you tiao stuff with fish cake- Honestly, I did not expect to be a fan of this dish because ""you tiaos"" (fried dough strips) are sooo oily but the ones at Jumbo are crispy and golden. The fish cake inside makes it even more flavorful and savory! Perfect combination. Ambiance: Jumbo's restaurant (outdoor seating area) is overlooking the beautiful Singapore river so you get a good view of Singpore's old port (now a tourist hotspot for boat cruises). I would recommend Jumbo over the boat cruise any day!"

This is the place to go for chilli crab, black / white pepper crab / egg yolk crab which I categorise as ""die die must eat"" hahaha....If you have enough people to share, I suggest you to order a bigger size (i.e. 1.5 kg), which the claw is more like a piece of steak and is much more fulfilling...sometimes sharing a 900g crab by 2 is not so enough. In that case I usually end up coming again before I take off back to HK...There are 2 Jumbos around Clarke Quay - One is right at the river side which is more open and the view is better, good to go with client / foreigners. The other one is at this Upper Circular Road which is indoor and it is less crowded in terms of seating but usually serves 3 rounds everyday (6:00 - 7:30, 7:30 - 9:00, 9:00 onward).

Of course, chilli crab is a must, and it's very good. The sauce is hot but really flavorful.  It's not quite as great of a chilli sauce as the Seafood International out by East Coast Park, but still good.  A perfect dish is the fried 'mantou' (buns); excellent dipped in the chilli sauce.  The slightly-sweet breadiness helps to cut the spice. We usually get a couple of veg dishes, too, which are pretty standard.

This was the third time this year that I've been to Jumbo and again it lived up to the billing. My pal Sophia, my go-to Singapore Foodie says Jumbo is the place to go for crab and when it comes to food in Singapore, what Sophia says goes!There were a group of 12 of us, thirsty from chatting with customers all day and ready to drain some Tiger beer and murder some crab. We started with some appetizers including some great river shrimp. The chili crab was the first to come-as the other reviewer said, the mantou buns are a must, for mopping up the extra sauce, of which there's plenty. We also got some veggie dishes and noodles to keep the crab company, but I was waiting for his brother to make an appearance. Finally the pepper crab came-also awesome! Whereas the chili crab has an ebi-chili sweetness about it, the pepper crab lives up to its name an has a peppery after-kick.   Good thing I cut my nails the day before-Singapore crab, like sand at the beach, gets everywhere, and it was nice not to have to dig it out, per prior visits.The riverside branch of the restaurant was bustling, as always, and we sat outside, as always. great people watching and the river after dark feels cool-the icy Tiger helped. Bill for a dozen, eating and drinking reasonably but not leaving hungry, was SIN $600-ish, pretty reasonable by business dinner standards, compared to North America US or Western Europe. It's F1 this weekend, so the place is probably packed-reservations advised even after the show moves on. It's popular with locals, expats and tourists alike. There are six locations to choose from.

The shell was only the size of my Samsung galaxy and pieces were mixed from other crab. The texture of the meats of each pieces and even the sizes of each legs did not match what I was expecting from a 1.5kg crab. I asked the waitress, which she denied and tried to brush it off.

Got lucky and was sent to a table instantly, rather than the party ahead of us who had to wait 45 mins. This jumbo seafood restaurant is at Riverwalk, across from Clark Quay and on the water still. This night we got a table outside but still under cover, the rain had just stopped also. Since we had a few other people in our party, we ordered a bit more food than usual and it turned out to be just enough. The black pepper crab was the single best item ordered. The crabs overall seemed a bit small compared to Spring Court but not bad still. The chili crab was OK but the sauce was a bit thin and definitely not as good as East Coast or Spring Court. The fried buns were delicious as always (but are these ever bad? anywhere??), the kang kong tasted the same and the fried rice was good too, nothing especially good though. An enjoyable meal overall but not the best of anything."

Perhaps I ordered the wrong menu items?The sigara borek is pretty good - think fried Turkish spring rolls with cheese filling. The karisik kebab (mixed kebab plate) was next. Although the meats (lamb, chicken, ground beef) were grilled well, they came smothered with an asian-like brown sauce and accompanied by stir fried broccoli and cauliflower (!). Don't get me wrong, it tastes good but I don't think it's authentic.Sadly, the künefe was also disappointing. The kadaif pastry (noodly phyllo dough) was left too long over the fire and was pretty charred when it came to the table (see photo). Too much of the element with atomic number 6 isn't my idea of a good time.Eh, so there's this row of Turkish restaurants along Bussorah St leading up to the Sultan Mosque, all in competition with one another. The menus were mindbogglingly extensive and restaurants were filled with tourists. Had to pick one restaurant to try. Decided to come here as the menu items looked pretty authentic, but I guess I was wrong. I don't claim to be Turkish food expert, but I've lived with a couple of Turkish roommates and was educated on the food and how to make a mean pot of Turkish coffee. I'm sure Singaporean stomachs can digest the authentic stuff. Off to try the next restaurant along the row."

Alaturka is the place to go for some really good turkish cuisine and still have a cool glass/bottle of beer to go with it. (Alaturka sectioned their restaurant into 2 areas where those who would like to order alcohol can sit in the other section, away from the main restaurant where they strictly do not serve alcohol.)If you want to truly enjoy a hearty turkish meal here, I would advise to come with a few more friends. This is because the serving is rather generous and between 2 pax, it may be challenging to order a variety.Some staple that will ALWAYS be on my table, regardless of whether Im there with only 2 pax or more, are the HUMMUS and one of their huge platter for two that has a combination of different types of kebabs. The hummus is really smooth and the amount of olive oil is just right in my opinion, thus it not too wet nor too dry. The bread that comes along with it is also exceptionally delicious. It's definitely a great complement to the hummus.As for the platter, it would have been more ideal to share between three to four light eaters as it comes with a whole lot of different types of protein such as chicken, beef and lamb and a serving of veg and rice. The gravy is slightly salty thus the rice (buttery on its own) is a great side to neutralise the saltiness of the dish.To round up the meal, a pot of the hot turkish apple tea will surely do the trick. Slightly sour while rich in it's apple fragrance and sweetness, I simply love the taste of it. Will definitely introduce it to my friends. :)"

The place is small, a little narrow and tables are close together - but it has a nice homey feel. The food is yummmmy! Rice and Kebabs are my fave, the Adana Kebab, and their traditional Turkish bread, the Sarmusatli & Ekmek. There are not too many Turkish places at Arab Street, so it really does stand out.MUST HAVES: The Musaka, eggplant & lamb stew, Omg, I'm like literally aching for one now. Hahahaha. The Ali Nazik is yummy too.Desserts: Baklava and Kunefe is REALLY REALLY yummy here! Especially the Kunefe!What I don't love: Prices. It's quite a pricey place. But the food is good. It's an average of $18-25 per pax, just for the mains. So, if you're getting a starter, main, drink and dessert, it would range from $30-35 per pax. So, it's pricier than other places in Arab Street.

I came here at 10:30 in the morning and there was already a line with 3 people in front of me. With only one item being served and only one size, ordering was a breeze. When it's your turn, just let them know how many bowls when you're standing in the queue. Watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times. The bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake, and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl. Taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa I've had before was by no means on par with Sungei Road. The soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste, the complex blends that builds the curry, and finally the spiciness from the chili paste.Eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long, don't wear a white shirt by the way! The bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards."

They do not give you chopsticks and only provide you with a small soup spoon to slurp up all of the noodles in the bowl, but I didn't find this to be a problem at all. The coconut flavor was pretty strong, but after I finished my bowl, I found that the overall flavor was not as strong as I was expecting. I liked the spices and seasoning in the broth as they were not overwhelmingly heavy. I thought that I would still be starving after downing such a tiny bowl, but I was surprisingly content.

I came here at 10:30 in the morning and there was already a line with 3 people in front of me. With only one item being served and only one size, ordering was a breeze. When it's your turn, just let them know how many bowls when you're standing in the queue. Watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times. The bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake, and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl. Taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa I've had before was by no means on par with Sungei Road. The soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste, the complex blends that builds the curry, and finally the spiciness from the chili paste.Eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long, don't wear a white shirt by the way! The bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards."

I'd never seen anyone so cavalierly scoop spoonfuls of cockles out of a big bucket of cockles before. To me, cockles are things you laboriously pry open for minutes on end just for one sweet bite. Having 7 of them in one bowl was unimaginably decadent.Also, the broth: while it's coconutty, that's not the dominant taste. It's funky and green and very spicy if you choose to mix the whole dollop of chili in. They don't let you use chopsticks, which I don't understand, unless it's to recreate the frustration of trying to get cockles out of their shells; the noodles are too slippery and long to be held by the spoons and you end up slurping them right out of the bowl. Luckily, that's not considered rude in Asia."

The soup was good, but not as rich as I expected for laksa. One bowl is probably not enough for a meal, but a great snack size. The noodles were quite soft, a bit too soft for my liking. Almost don't have to chew...Ordering system is a bit quirky. You tell them how many bowls you want, when there are still customers in front of you, so they can start preparing them. Its quite interesting to watch them work. It seems like they have the process down to a science. The number of scoops of soup in and out of bowls, etc. And they work with a charcoal stove.

Well, its right here at Jalan Berseh in a humble corner of a coffeeshop. Considering bowls of laksa that we had eaten before, nowadays, how many of them still have the gravy cook over charcoal fire?There are a few stalls named Sungei Road Laksa, apparently they are not affiliated with this stall as they have openly declared on their signage that there are no other branches. Sungei Road Laksa is a family business and you can the family members each having their dedicated tasks. You can observed the flow of their ordering process while you are in the long snaky queue.What makes a perfect bowl of Laksa? I'm not a fan of Laksa with strong ""Lemak"" (Coconut Milk"" gravy and Sungei Road Laksa has a well balance of all flavours in a simple $3 portion bowl. Just like the traditional way of eating, there is no use of chopsticks for the noodles as the long noodles wereLaksa - $3Gravy is not spicy and that is one of the reasons why I started loving it when I was a kid. Ingredients are simple with cockles, slices of fishcakes, laksa leaves and chilli to add some spicy kick to the bowl.I wouldn't say no to this comfort bowl of childhood favourite.  They are opened daily 9.30am to 5pm but closed on Wednesday.

Yelpers gave another great suggestion and this place definitely did not disappoint. The place is located in a more residential part of town. I actually took a taxi here as it wasn't very close to any subways stations. But it was so worth it! Its one of 5 stalls in a smaller hawker center. So order your food, watch them cook it, and take your order to any open table. They only sell one item (not even drinks), but its so good! Their laksa broth is creamy and flavorful, yet still light. You get a choice of spicy or not spicy. The spicy comes with a spoonful of chili sauce. Get it spicy, as it provides a good kick without the burning sensation. I rarely ever finish the soup when I eat noodles as I always feel like restaurant soup noodles use a lot of msg or salt in their soup. However, this was one of those times where I drank all the soup, licked the bowl, and still wanted more! I love the cockles they have in the soup. It has that seafood freshness and sweet taste, which I've never had before. The bowl is really small, but is only $2 SGD. The taxi driver suggested I order 2 bowls since the bowls are small. He was right, and 2 bowls were just perfect! They don't sell drinks. Instead, you'll see a lady come by from another stall taking drink orders. I brought my own bottled water, so I declined. But the lady sells juices and beer. There's also another old lady that comes by to sell you tissue packets, just in case you weren't carrying any on you. (No napkins provided here either.)FYI, they don't give you chopsticks for these noodles, and you don't really need them. The spoon they provide is enough to finish all the noodles and soup!"

Katong laksa being a signature Singaporean dish.It's also unique in its own right that you do not eat it with fork or chopsticks, but only with a spoon. I guess that's where half the flavor comes from (the broth).It's tasty and cheap ($3 !) for that it gets 5 stars alone. Not to mention it's cooked on a charcoal fired stove which adds to the flavor.This particular place is a family business and very recently got passed down to the next generation, so I'm very happy that we can still enjoy the cheap and tasty goodness that this place has to offer.The best time to come is around opening time (9-10am) or late lunchtime (around 3pm), otherwise expect a long queue.

I had only tried laksa a couple times before at sit down restaurants, which likely have a completely different approach to this dish. Anyway, being in Singapore, I knew I had to come and try an authentic bowl of laksa. After reading a few google hits on ""best laksa in singapore,"" I saw that this place consistently was mentioned and was closest to my hotel (my mom will walk nowhere in the heat). So we came here. It was located inside a pretty archetypal hawker market. not the cleaner style newer ones that are inside and air conditioned, but an open air alcove of food stalls with just a few ceiling fans to combat the heat. (Note, this place does have bathrooms that don't charge, which is a plus for a hawker market). Anyway, the sungie road laksa stall is located in one of the corners to the market. I'm pretty sure they only serve this one dish, so it's pretty efficient service. However, note that they do not provide chopsticks, which I found weird. Although the laksa noodles are cut short, they still don't fit that well onto the spoon and chopsticks would have been helpful. Moving on. I ordered a bowl for myself and a bowl for my dad. I guess the first thing I noticed was that this version didn't have prawns, which I thought was a sine qua non for laksa. It had only fish cakes and what I thought were clams but what my Singaporean mom said were cockles. So I guess they were cockles. It was not aesthetically pleasing like the laksa I had seen before. Also, while I used to love them, I'm not a huge fan of bivalves anymore because they kind of taste like sand and saltwater to me now. Also they look gross. But how did the whole thing taste? The broth was tasty, though it started getting very spicy toward the end because I mixed the entire dollop of chili paste into my broth. Definitely buy a chaser of water with this dish. The fish cakes had a very light flavor to them, however, the cockles tasted like the aforementioned saltwater and sand, which I didn't prefer, but ate anyway because I was starving. Overall, I guess I was just expecting more. More seafood, more flavor, more presentation. But, my Singaporean dad, who grew up eating laksa, said it was one of the best he had ever had, so I guess it's probably really good to people who know what they are talking about."

The illustrious heritage hawker still uses charcoal to fire up his stove, and if you ever thought it was no biggie to use charcoal fire, Sungei Road Laksa will change your mind; it's immediately evident that the smoky char of the fire imbues each bowl of laksa with an irresistibly heady aroma.The queues may be legendary but clockwork-efficient production of the noodles ensures the line moves fast. But if you're really averse to waiting in line, the best time to hit up Sungei Road Laksa is after the peak lunch hours on weekdays. There's hardly a queue then. The standard order Laksa ($3) is loaded with beansprouts, fishcake and cockles. The cockles, though petite, are swimmingly fresh and succulent, and lend a briny accent to the rich and robust gravy. If you can take the heat, ask for extra helpings of the sambal chilli to stir into the gravy, it adds a potent punch and complements the laksa base."

The restaurant was one of the largest restaurants in the city to offer Halal-Certified International cuisine. Its menu ranged from Western, Asian to Indian and Mediterranean delights. Currently they are running a seafood promotion buffet. For a typical weekday night, I was surprised to find that the restaurant was packed with lots of customers. The first station which met us was the typical salad bar with a variety of salads and dressings. But the smell which attracted me was Sup Tulang (Malay for ""bone soup""). I was met was a huge pile of bones with tender meat. Don't forget to ask for a straw to tastiest bits of marrow out from the skeletal hollows. The soup was rich and full-bodied. I could have bowls of this if there was no other delicious food around. There was none of the gamy taste that was commonly associated with mutton dishes. It was the first time for me to see this dish in a buffet, let alone a hotel restaurant.Another unique dish was Chilli Crab. Unlike the usual version which was served in a pool of gravy with egg, the version here was dry and coated in a rich thick delicious sambal paste. Next to the soup, was a bed of seafood such as mussels, cooked prawns and clams on ice. The seafood was fresh and juicy. At the Live Station, there was pasta cooked upon order with choice of tomato or cream sauce. I had the spaghetti in cream sauce which was well cooked and tasted rich and creamy.There was also a INDIAN CORNER, which offered a variety of Indian dishes as such Tandoori Chicken, Mix Dal, Aloo Gobi, Butter Chicken and assorted Naans (Garlic, Plain and Butter). The butter chicken covered in a rich spicy gravy, was very tender and flavourful.Don't forget to help oneself to the BEVERAGES Corner, which was filled with soft drinks and hot drinks.Lastly there was the Dessert Corner, which offered a variety of malay style of kuehs, Gulam Jamun, Bubur Pulut HItam, Mango pudding, Tropical Fresh fruit. Interesting seeing Gulam Jamun in the buffet which usually only spotted in Indian restaurants. The kuehs were delicious and well made.We ended with a cup of Masala Chai (Spiced Milk Tea), which was another drink which I usually spotted at Indian restaurants. Overall the food was delicious especially the local dishes which were not commonly found in buffet in Singapore. The price for the buffet was quite reasonable too at $30++ per adult. It was considered quite cheap when compared to most hotel buffets."

So we tried again the next day right at 9am, before our flight out at noon, thinking that we had plenty of time in between. Man, we were wrong. First off, we didn't know that we should have got there even earlier to claim one of the 25 tokens that will keep your first 25 spots before the line even started to form. So although there were only about 8 people in front of us when we got in line, it took them 1.5 hour total to go through those 25 tokens and the people in front of the line AND AT LEAST 10 OTHER to-go orders (which, I think, should have been taken care of ONLY AFTER those people who are actually waiting in person). Food: we ordered 2 Bak Chor Mee and they were tasty. It's a shame that we had to inhale our food right away to leave for the airport; and not so much enjoying it after the long wait. Overall, I think I can go somewhere else for similar noodles without the wait and cheaper price tag (not that $8 was expensive but Singapore just offers so many options for cheap eat). The verdict: I'm glad that I tried their noodles and it was honestly really good. I can see why they got the Michelin Star. However, I would only go back if the wait is a lot shorter and definitely not before catching a flight in less than 3 hours."

You'll find the long lines but not of locals but of tourists. I've had better Pork noodles in singapore at a cheaper price and shorter wait. Yes the noodles stand out but i feel like the soup and ingredients were standard. The fish cracklins were great though. Crunchy and flavorful. It's a try if in the area but i wouldn't go out of ones way to get a bowl.

I planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported. Arrived at 5pm and there was a queue but tolerable. Waited 30 minutes for my food. A good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you. Multiply by 2 as each is likely ordering for 2 people. Then multiply by 2 again as it takes 2 mins to prepare a bowl of noodles. So # of people in front of you * 4 = average wait time. Is it worth waiting more than 30 mins? I don't think so. The bak chor mee (minced pork Noodles) is ok. Nothing to scream about. I had the $8 dry version with mee pok (flat yellow egg noodles). Good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat (sliced pork, minced pork, sliced liver, gyoza and deep fried fish (ti po)). A dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms. The black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good. There is a ji chai soup for $6 which in my mind is way over priced. Dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee. Can skip without missing anything. A good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar. This place missed out on the mushroom. Presentation wise, tai Hwa has it better than others. The over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye. Remember it still has a lot of carbs. My suggestion is to go at off peak times, order the $6 dry or soup version and if wait is longer than 30 mins, come back another time."

Halfway through the wait (maybe 5-6 people ahead of you), you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait. The noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop. I ordered the $6 bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what I previously remembered. I would have skipped the meatball soup if I knew there were more 2 meatballs in the $6 portion. I ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with 15 meatballs for $6.

Let's get that right out of the way. So much so, that I've spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is Tai Hwa Pork Noodle. Obviously my homemade version isn't as good, but with some tweaks I think it could be a passable substitute. Here is where the wheels fall off the wagon. It's cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it's received. On our first attempt, we waited for about 1.25 hours and only moved 4 tiles (we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go) which was not much. We gave up.We returned the next morning 30 minutes before opening and received number `11`. If you guys are missing a number `11`, I might know why. It was another hour wait before we got our food -- this time we were determined; which was delicious as I've mentioned. The whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of Singaporean weather was just lost on me. Yes the food was delicious. Yes it was cheap. But for a Michelin star you have to do something above and beyond. I feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over Singapore, you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha.. It's the challenge that Yelp and Michelin diners face -- seek these places out! Find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent. Blaze the trail for others to follow. Don't just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective. You might find something you really like... A diamond in the rough."

Pretty good time if you ask me.This was literally the best thing I ate in Singapore! We only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls, and this was most convenient to us. It was the first time I inhaled my food on this trip. I was only there for 4 days, and I've lived in Hong Kong for a while so the Chinese styled food did not wow me but this did! Now I didn't have much expectation for it since it didn't look that appealing but the taste was amazing! The flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency, al dente, which is how I like mine. The sauce was what made it amazing! Now, I don't typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy. This sauce was spectacular. It had a vinegary taste (which some people may not like), and perfectly salted. Not too strong either. The condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles. ...my mouth is watering as I am writing this. The generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me. I've never had liver so perfectly cooked before, and I've never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture. But this was was just melt in your mouth liver, and it was so good! Comes with a cup of liver/seaweed soup. It's so good! Reminds me of my momma's soup but taste so much better! I don't know if you can tell, but I love this place.Everything was cooked so fast too! The line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so I was quite happy. They were efficient with cooking, and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive.Need drinks too? You can go right next to it. Get some coffee or lemon honey. They make it right in front of you! The location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters. Would defos come back if I were in Singapore again!"

Unlike the other stall, they don't really advertise their Michelin star and the only way you'll know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line. I got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue. Whilst lining up, I noticed there were signs for a $5, $6, $10, and $12 noodle. Asking around, people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order, that's not quite the case. Ordering was a bit daunting but somehow I managed to communicate for a $5 dry, non-spicy Bak Chor Mee. Watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing, he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one. Then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands, he'll handle your cash payment...When I got my order, I noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that I had seen in the pictures and inquired why. They simply stated it was because I ordered the $5 version, the full version was at $6, so I found out the hard way the pricing didn't dictate size alone. The noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't identify. Texturally, the dish was very interesting, with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate. In terms of the flavor profile, it really wasn't for me. The vinegar was simply too overpowering and I don't really get the hype with this dish. The side bowl of soup was also quite bland, nothing really special. If you're a fan of sour and spicy, it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait, but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors, give this place a pass."

I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration. While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon. I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now. When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness). The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls. A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size). While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side). Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used. The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp. The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer. The SoupIf you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it... As long as the queue isn't anything more that 30 mins."

I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order. Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big! Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like ""I'll come back one day"". Note:- Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try! Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466. Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it!"

In long, flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex. But almost to a fault. The dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar. The liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals. The dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost.  The soupy rice noodle is a bit better, but the noodles lack al dente texture. The sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor.  The ground pork is again tough and relatively bland. The fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish, as does seaweed slivers. Singapore is an immaculate city, but an interesting practice occurred at this joint: the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls...but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish.  After the top dish touched the soiled countertop, it defied logic why he'd place the dish on top of the other bowl's noodles, but hey, what do I know.  In sum, certainly worth a try, but not all that glitters with Michelin stars is gold."

Once the restaurant opens, they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line. It was our last meal in Singapore so we definitely went all out. Instead of one $10 bowl, we both got two $5 bowls which meant more food for the price! It's pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it.  You can taste the difference and it tastes good. I can see why they got a Michelin star. The bowls are small though. The people there speak little English and mostly mandarin. Ordering was easy though because there aren't too many choices. The bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go. It's vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture. I hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me.

It is fun watching the chef create the dish at the front of the line.I got the dry and soup noodles. As for the soup noodles, I did not get much flavor in the noodles. I was questioning what was the hype. But then after trying the broth, I knew that was the key. Very flavorful and very thoughtful how they created this dish. The dry noodle dish is good as well. It has strong vinegar taste to it. Also the soup provided is on the sour side. All very good.I can see it getting hot eating here. You are eating hot food after all.

So we tried again the next day right at 9am, before our flight out at noon, thinking that we had plenty of time in between. Man, we were wrong. First off, we didn't know that we should have got there even earlier to claim one of the 25 tokens that will keep your first 25 spots before the line even started to form. So although there were only about 8 people in front of us when we got in line, it took them 1.5 hour total to go through those 25 tokens and the people in front of the line AND AT LEAST 10 OTHER to-go orders (which, I think, should have been taken care of ONLY AFTER those people who are actually waiting in person). Food: we ordered 2 Bak Chor Mee and they were tasty. It's a shame that we had to inhale our food right away to leave for the airport; and not so much enjoying it after the long wait. Overall, I think I can go somewhere else for similar noodles without the wait and cheaper price tag (not that $8 was expensive but Singapore just offers so many options for cheap eat). The verdict: I'm glad that I tried their noodles and it was honestly really good. I can see why they got the Michelin Star.

Hard to find the sweet spot on when the wait will be shortest. The queue system is neater now. Halfway through the wait (maybe 5-6 people ahead of you), you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait. The noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop. I ordered the $6 bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what I previously remembered. I would have skipped the meatball soup if I knew there were more 2 meatballs in the $6 portion. I ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with 15 meatballs for $6. It was soft but a bit on the salty side. I still gave it a 3 stars because of the queue system. Not everyone can stand for that long. I rather you order it and then get a number or buzzer and wait."

Let's get that right out of the way. So much so, that I've spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is Tai Hwa Pork Noodle. Obviously my homemade version isn't as good, but with some tweaks I think it could be a passable substitute. Here is where the wheels fall off the wagon. It's cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it's received. On our first attempt, we waited for about 1.25 hours and only moved 4 tiles (we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go) which was not much. We gave up.We returned the next morning 30 minutes before opening and received number `11`. If you guys are missing a number `11`, I might know why. It was another hour wait before we got our food -- this time we were determined; which was delicious as I've mentioned. The whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of Singaporean weather was just lost on me. Yes the food was delicious. Yes it was cheap. But for a Michelin star you have to do something above and beyond. I feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over Singapore, you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha.. It's the challenge that Yelp and Michelin diners face -- seek these places out! Find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent. Blaze the trail for others to follow. Don't just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective. You might find something you really like... A diamond in the rough."

The wait was totally worth it. The noodles were hand pulled, very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base. There was a wide selection of minced pork, liver, sliced pork, wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl. Plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours.

Pretty good time if you ask me.This was literally the best thing I ate in Singapore! We only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls, and this was most convenient to us. It was the first time I inhaled my food on this trip. I was only there for 4 days, and I've lived in Hong Kong for a while so the Chinese styled food did not wow me but this did! Now I didn't have much expectation for it since it didn't look that appealing but the taste was amazing! The flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency, al dente, which is how I like mine. The sauce was what made it amazing! Now, I don't typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy. This sauce was spectacular. It had a vinegary taste (which some people may not like), and perfectly salted. Not too strong either. The condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles. ...my mouth is watering as I am writing this. The generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me. I've never had liver so perfectly cooked before, and I've never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture. But this was was just melt in your mouth liver, and it was so good! Comes with a cup of liver/seaweed soup. It's so good! Reminds me of my momma's soup but taste so much better! I don't know if you can tell, but I love this place.Everything was cooked so fast too! The line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so I was quite happy. They were efficient with cooking, and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive.Need drinks too? You can go right next to it. Get some coffee or lemon honey. They make it right in front of you! The location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters.

Unlike the other stall, they don't really advertise their Michelin star and the only way you'll know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line. I got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue. Whilst lining up, I noticed there were signs for a $5, $6, $10, and $12 noodle. Asking around, people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order, that's not quite the case. Ordering was a bit daunting but somehow I managed to communicate for a $5 dry, non-spicy Bak Chor Mee. Watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing, he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one. Then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands, he'll handle your cash payment...When I got my order, I noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that I had seen in the pictures and inquired why. They simply stated it was because I ordered the $5 version, the full version was at $6, so I found out the hard way the pricing didn't dictate size alone. The noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't identify. Texturally, the dish was very interesting, with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate. In terms of the flavor profile, it really wasn't for me. The vinegar was simply too overpowering and I don't really get the hype with this dish. The side bowl of soup was also quite bland, nothing really special. If you're a fan of sour and spicy, it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait, but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors, give this place a pass."

I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration. While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon. I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now. When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness). The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls. A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size). While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side). Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used. The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp. The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer. The SoupIf you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it...

I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order. Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big! Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like ""I'll come back one day"". Note:- Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try! Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466. Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it!"

In long, flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex. But almost to a fault. The dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar. The liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals. The dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost.  The soupy rice noodle is a bit better, but the noodles lack al dente texture. The sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor.  The ground pork is again tough and relatively bland. The fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish, as does seaweed slivers. Singapore is an immaculate city, but an interesting practice occurred at this joint: the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls...but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish.  After the top dish touched the soiled countertop, it defied logic why he'd place the dish on top of the other bowl's noodles, but hey, what do I know.  In sum, certainly worth a try, but not all that glitters with Michelin stars is gold."

Definitely get there before they open because the line goes out the door the moment the store actually is open for orders. Once the restaurant opens, they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line. It was our last meal in Singapore so we definitely went all out. Instead of one $10 bowl, we both got two $5 bowls which meant more food for the price! It's pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it.  You can taste the difference and it tastes good. I can see why they got a Michelin star. The bowls are small though. The people there speak little English and mostly mandarin. Ordering was easy though because there aren't too many choices. The bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go. It's vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture. I hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me. There isn't a lot of meat but most dishes don't come with a lot of meat in south east Asia. We also got the meatball soup! Yummy! I would definitely come back as long as I could avoid the lines.

The queue during lunch might be a little daunting, so try to come down during off peak hours but even during off peak, one can expect to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes to see the front of the queue.

You will have to order in a particular sequence - price of the bowl you want, type of noodle, dry or soup and then all the misc special request (less spicy, more vinegar, no liver etc). If in a group, please remember to order per bowl. so don't go like ""2 bowls of $5 mee pok, no chill"" - you will be left #ignored. When your bowl is presented to you, you will be glad you actually waited. the noodles are cooked perfectly with all the quality ingredients one will want in a bowl of bak chor mee. you have the minced pork, the liver slices, the singluar meatball, that lonely piece of vegetable mixed in a crazy sauce that one will relish till the very last drop. Mix them all up and slowly enjoy the goodness in every bite. The accompanying soup is also really flavourful and one can only wonder how their wonton soup will taste like!

I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration. While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon. I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now. When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness). The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls. A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size). While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side). Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used. The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp. The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer. The SoupIf you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it... As long as the queue isn't anything more that 30 mins."

And as it was with in walking distance from my hotel I decided to track down this establishment. What I found was a small hawker stall just off North Bridge road (about a 1/4 mile NE of Raffles) that, in the middle of the afternoon, had a queue. No other stall I passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day. The queue was a very promising sign.It was fortunate that I had written down ""bak chor mee"" (even though I had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish -- I was being adventuresome), because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff doesn't seem to understand much English. Upon my placing the order phonetically, the man asked ,me a question I didn't understand. I guessed that he wanted to know if I wanted chili sauce on my noodles. I nodded.My bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork -- shredded, sliced, and some pieces of liver-- together with few other items I couldn't identify. I was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty, although I might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference ( just for reference: I like my salsas between mild and medium). A bowl of soup accompanied the noodles, a flavorful (seaweed?) both that had a little aftertaste of liver. Overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile."

Anyway, i was not disappointed with the taste, not too salty and very flavourful with just a highlight of sourness coming from the vinegar.I also liked the fried bits of lard and the liver bits, which wasn't too overpowering and given in the correct amount.

I was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt, seeing as how it was a family-run stall dating back to 1932. Despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a Wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway, and contributed to the already high expectations that I'd had of the noodles here.Um sadly. Wasn't impressed.I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following. The gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do, which I suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick. The fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia (thin noodles), and the pork used here in all its forms - minced, sliced, livers and balls - is fresh, chewy and of good quality. Oh, the one thing that I liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it. I could literally see a meat cloud in it, which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted.I'm going to go all out blasphemous and say that I don't get the hype about the bak chor mee here. At all. This was okay bak chor mee, yes - but to call it the best bak chor mee in Singapore when I can't even decide if I prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood? Nahhh, I'll take convenience any day.Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm."

The pork balls are also very tasty without having that artificial flavour to it, and to crown it off, they add some bits of crispy deep fried dried fish, which adds that bit of crunch and saltiness to the whole bowl. One wonders why this doesn't feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination!
