What do I mean when I say best, the softest chicken meat, no weird smells of chicken, the fluffiest rice and awesome sauce (ginger, garlic, chili, etc.). This place has it all.This place is not located in a convenient location mind you, but once you get there the food will sure please you. A train and bus ride is what I took.The chicken was succulent yet soft and very fragrant. Rice was good with the sauce.This trip was well worth it!"

I think not.What's good? Fresh ginger sauce was spot on. Liver & gizzard was good but far from foie gras. Service was good & friendly. What could be improved? Chili sauce too watery & diluted for my liking. Chicken thigh lacked the gelatinous jelly I like at Tian Tian. Rice was rather plain. Chicken soup was an improvement over dish water but still weak. Overall nott bad but overhyped.

I may conceive of words like ethereal, unctuous, decadent, seraphic, and climactic, but in the end they are just words, so much powdery dust in the mouth, when what I experience each time pork fat attains body temperature and melts over the papules of my sensation is nothing short of revelatory.  Iskina's belly-chon or belly lechon does not disappoint.  The skin is goodness and light itself, a brown crispy rind, barely layered over that pale vein of subcutaneous fat, a gossamer thin covering barely concealing the voluptuous pleasures underneath.  This truly took time, skill and the restraint bestowed by expertise, maturity, and doing the same damned thing over and over again.I won't sully this review with mundane details like price point or serving portions.  I'll just say that something this good over steamed rice with some chili vinegar and a sprinkling of ajinomoto laced soy would easily make it onto my list of ""One Food I Could Eat Everyday for the Rest of My Life"", but alas, I'm back on no-carbs for the time being.  Till I fall off the no-carb wagon, nirvana will just have to exist in my early morning waking dreams."

They were run by students in training to be chefs and wait staff in top restaurants. They then had changed their name to ""Charcoal"". Now they have relocated here and changed their branding to ""The Sapling"". The concept is the same, most-times tasty food served by eager wait staff who at times made mistakes. But hey, they are in training so cut them some slack lah! I enjoyed their pricing the most! All mains are no more than $12 and you can top up $4.90 for a buffet of soup, salad bar and desserts with your main. My good friend who had dined there a few times did mention that I should manage my expectations as there were hits and misses with their food. She usually eats the same main there and there was once the fish she felt was too overdone, to the point that it was charred. We were a big group of us and we had:Vongole with Linguine - this was a fusion dish which was essentially Hokkien fried mee style with linguine instead of yellow noodle and white clams instead of prawns. It's a tad spicy with worked well as a dish! Good!Tea-smoked Duck with Pasta in cream sauce - I thought the duck slices were very good, could taste the tea-infused flavours. I liked the creamy sauce but another friend who had it didn't. Oh well. Seafood Stew - I didn't quite understand the name because the dish was a big slab of fish with skin that  was pan-fried till crispy and the meat juicy. This was served with white clams cooked in creamy sauce (diff from Smoked duck dish). I cleaned the plate. Roasted Chicken with Rice - this is their Christmas special I think which is a set for 2. Each person would have half a chicken, 2 onion rings and a serving of mushroom flavoured rice. My kids didn't like the rice but I thought they were WONDERFUL!We had the top up so we had mushroom soup which I found a little bland. Nothing a bit of salt didn't fix. I also had some potato salad and some greens with one of the 6 dressings available. I didn't have space to try their 3 desserts available and the fruit cups that they had. I think I would need to plan harder by skipping breakfast the next time I return. Yes, there will definitely be a 'next time'!!!"

Still, one of the better Korean BBQ joints in Singapore - one of the few using charcoal fires. They also charge higher prices, so it's good but not necessarily good value."

I don't think I'll ever try any other Korean BBQ that tops it. We walked in to Chang and the place was very bright, with a lot of seating. They were steadily busy, but not packed. There were mostly families with their young children. It was definitely a lot quieter than 8 Korean BBQ and our server was very friendly and helpful with our questions. We ordered the beef/pork combination along with red wine and were pleased with our meal. The food was good, and it was easy to follow our Paleo diet. The price at Chang was about the same as the price at 8 Korean BBQ, but I think we got a lot more bang for our buck with the pork package offered at the latter. It included a stew along with all of the meat and sides. Don't get me wrong, the service and food were both good, but nothing about Chang Korean Charcoal BBQ stood out to me that would bring me back. There's a lot of competition out there and I think 8 Korean BBQ has the edge."

The salatasi is the Turkish version which mashes the eggplants rather than cutting them up as is done for baba ghanoush.I'm glad there's some place I can go and just sit down to a dish of salatasi without having to do it myself and end up with a serviceable but not very good version, and have to clean up after.  Yes, if you haven't yet gathered, I am pretty lazy.This is a very small casual cafe.  In Turkey, it might really be the hole in the wall that it is in Fusionopolis.  Casual, unpretentious and with food that doesn't aspire to more than to please and represent its origins, Arkadas is ""good peoples"" in my book."

I actually liked the coolness of it, and the slight tang though! Went very well with the warm bread :)We also had cream of asparagus soup ($5). It was fine, nothing to shout about. Tasted somewhat like cream of mushroom plus some asparagus thrown in. Tender and well cooked asparagus though!Our friends ordered musakka (minced beef w green peppers n tomatoes, and lots of cheese) and izgara kofte (minced lamb beef patties). They were fairly pleased with the former but not so much the latter. Girl found it a little spicy while guy found it a bit dry. My bf liked the kofte though, finished what they couldn't!Our chicken shish kebab was pretty good, tender. 5 pieces on the skewer. Does NOT come with grilled veggies (or asparagus stalk) like it looks like on the website though.. Ah well. Butter rice was pretty good!Choc mousse ($4) had been highly recommended too, it was very very thick as well. Choc shavings on the top, yum! Baklava ($6 or so?) came as three small squares. It was seriously a sugar overload.. Or perhaps honey overload. Instant diabetes!!! Overly sweet/sugary, unfortunately."

The filo pastry wasn't crispy and it was extremely soggy. I was looking for a couple more exotic dishes and desserts like lahmacun, imam bayildi and kunefe but they weren't on the menu. A lot of the items were modified to cater to the Singaporean (and asian) palate. The turkish bread (ekmek) is strangely listed as ""pita"" under the menu for some reason. I don't claim to be Turkish food expert (lived with a couple of Turkish roommates and was educated on how to cook and eat the stuff) but I don't think the place is particularly authentic with the modified sauces and spices.Good to try, but looks like I'm heading to Arab Street."

Hummus was decent but the doner had fried instead of grilled chicken, which resulted in some disapproving clucks.As other reviewers have pointed out, the prices are high for the quantity of food served.

However it was mostly meat and didn't contain much prawn.The braised tofu was okay - normal. The plain fried kai lan was okay too.The best part of the meal - for better or for worse - was the coconut. The coconut water was sweet and rich, and te flesh was tender, tasty and easy to scoop out.Sadly they were out of orh nee (sweet yam paste) so we couldn't try that.Overall this place is passable, but overrated.

I like it! This usually goes for about $50 for a good sized one. Still cheaper than many small restaurants and definitely cheaper than the bigger fancier restaurants.2) crayfish (small is $28. seemed to come with 6 half pieces in a chilli crab style sauce)3) hokkien mee - quite lipsmacking! Good sized portion.4) cold crab - it's fresh of course but I really do enjoy my crab hot so I seldom get this.I'm a coconut fan and they serve them here.Hmm, maybe I should try other things next time.

Hard Rock Cafe has been on Earth for as long as I can remember and I enjoy trying out the Hard Rock Cafes in the different countries I visit. Awhile ago, a friend from school decided to visit me in Singapore and as she was a tourist and I felt like being one, we went to Hard Rock Cafe for dinner. It is not very different in design from other Hard Rock Cafes. It is dark inside with a bar area and loud music. Apparently there is live music on some nights, but there wasn't any the night we went. The food though was very different. Serving sizes are definitely smaller than those overseas, or at least those that I'd been to. We ordered the Hickory smoked Bar-B-Que Combo with ribs, chicken and smoked pulled pork since we couldn't make up our minds. It was beyond disappointing when we took our first bites and the meat was dry. The BBQ ribs were covered with a thick layer of sauce but the flavour had not even begun to enter the meat. I've had much more appetizing smoked pulled pork and the overall look of the dish was all the more unappetizing. The food looked like it had simply been thrown on the crowded plate and the sauces mixed with each other. Perhaps it is because I had expected much more from Hard Rock Cafe that has led to such disappointment. We decided to round off our meal with cocktails. It was the first cocktail my friend has ever had and she said that she probably would not have another one again. Given the rather expensive prices, I probably would not visit this Hard Rock Cafe again especially since I can get better American food elsewhere."

It is sheltered from the hustle and bustle of the busy roads with the lush greenery surrounding it. Turning in, we were greeted with a colourful mini play area for kids and a naturally lit greenhouse-esque cafe.M has been here previously and was quick to decide on the Teriyaki Chicken Salad ($11). The festive bowl of vegetables greeted us in a bit. Salads are often thought of as a boring, monotonous dish with a lot of crunching involved but Onaka showed that you can get both taste and texture. You also got a slice of bread with butter along with the salad, said butter was nicely warmed up by the afternoon sun (how's that for natural!).Being ravenous, the Omega-3 Salmon Rice Superbowl ($12) was the perfect dish to get. I got a deep bowl of grilled salmon flakes, sweet corn and boiled peas adorned on a bed of brown rice - super hearty, super healthy.Onaka also boosts a range of juices in its ""Juice Bar"" and the food it serves is (wait for it): dairy-free, egg-free, gluten-free, low GI & GL, sugar-free , vegan and vegetarian. You may not know all the dietary technicalities but you will know when you get good food, which is what Onaka offers. They have a different menu for breakfast & lunch and another for dinner.

I will say that the banana 'shake' (you get it from the stall in the back corner on the right hand side) was quite a nice refresher after sitting around in the heat for quite a while. Prices are obviously great, but what else is new at the hawker centre? If you're in the area, this is a good spot to take a break and grab a bite, but nothing to plan around.

While it had  considerably more modest  and decidedly traditional and humble beginnings as a hawker stall in a local coffee shop preparing and serving local breakfast fare; runny eggs which you'd slurp clean off a saucer after dousing with dark soy and white pepper, and Balsa light sheets of a toasted local loaf slathered with kaya(sweet coconut jam) inlaid with bright yellow chips of cold butter, it has morphed into an entity that is permanent part of the Singaporean gastronomic consciousness.  Ya Kun is as ubiquitous as the Golden Arches and as recognizable.  But also stop to consider that this is a chain of restaurants or fast food joints that serves food that punctilious food-crazy Singaporeans would consider good and worth their time and coin.  You see, in Singapore fast food is not necessarily bad food or even mediocre food. Expectations are no lower just because you may not have sit down service or table linen, in fact expectations may be higher!Simple, tasty, and inexpensive cuisine is so pervasive in Singaporean culinary culture, that nobody thinks twice about expecting good food from a chain restaurant.  Ya Kun is certainly no exception and has continued to serve up what it does best, traditional comfort food quickly, hygienically and in an environment where diners can relive fond childhood food experiences in air conditioned comfort. Add a touch of business savvy and an effective marketing and franchising strategy and you understand why Ya Kun has become a  Singaporean institution and a pioneer in one of the possible evolutionary paths for Singaporean hawker culture.I adore Ya Kun for serving up food that makes me feel good. It's not just that the food tastes good, the flavors are so true and traditional that it instantly brings back fond childhood memories of mornings in a neighborhood coffee shop tucked behind a shady five foot way, it's cavernous interior redolent of carmelized coffee beans cooling after being roasted with margarine and sugar, and the feel-good miasma of toast hanging thick all about you.  Thank you for the memories, Ya Kun!"
