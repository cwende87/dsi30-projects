I thought we were going to take the shuttle to the Heartland Mall (Kovan MRT station) to have lunch then go to this chocolate factory that the folks here keep mentioning but Sheng Teck took us to a new spot to eat, directly across from this chocolate factory. It was like all the other hawker centers I have been to but somewhat cleaner. As always, I find myself pondering what to eat every time because there are so many choices. Luckily, we found a table so I suggested for the 2 guys to grab their food first whilst I hold the table. Little did I know, I did not have to order any food for myself. As I was in line for some rice, roasted pork and char siu, Sheng Teck came up to me to tell me that he ordered enough food for him and I. Awwww, right? That guy literally stole my heart. + the rice was fluffy + portions are quite generous + the roasted pork was super tender + the BBQ pork was succulent + the roasted chicken melted in my mouth He also ordered something else for Jerry and I to try. I had no clue what it was but I tried it and feel like I deserve a medal for trying something I definitely was hesitant about, haha. The food was great. The best was my company. Both guys have a very special place in my heart. Thanks to this trip. I am so grateful. Thank you for treating, Sheng Teck :)"

The menu is filled with lots of hearty German fare, from sausages to schnitzel. We split a garlic sausage with sauerkraut and potato salad, and we were impressed! The sausage was juicy, and the sauerkraut complemented the creaminess of the potato salad.I was a little surprised that they didn't offer any soft pretzels as an option for appetizers; if they could do that I think it would make this place even better.

However the order was served with spaghetti by a apologetic staff saying they had no fettucini. Not too impressed with such poor service as they should ask customer first before preparing the meal. Too hungry to reject the order and wait for them to prepare something else so i took it  The mushrooms are not fresh mushroom but are instead canned button mushrooms. Beef is overcooked and tough. The sauce was salty but its expected cos its cheese.  I will stick to pies and pastries if i patronise them again the next time

I have to say my father has great taste (not only in finding a wife) - this is DA BEST fish-head steamboat in Singapore. Regardless of your choice of white pomfret or the red grouper, the pre-fried fish is always succulent and fresh, cooked to perfection in the full-flavoured soup. I remember as a kid I liked to select the half-soggy yam pieces from the soup, those were my favourite. The tofu prawn is a recommended side order. Its sauce is a different take with a little bit of spice, but it helps the rice to go down really well.Many people are willing to wait for these piping pots of steamy goodness, that's why we always make it a point to reach before dinner time.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews."

I have to say that that's pretty good for any country standards.Although the place says that it's a tapas bar, there is a fairly limited tapas menu, and not that exciting. But I have to say that the fried risotto is pretty fabulous. Their normal food menu, which are all full sized dishes, are all good. The pasta dishes are well cooked and are tasty. The pizza is a bit on the dry side, but good. This is really the place to come if you want to share a bottle of wine with your friends (or maybe just with yourself.)

So, look out for these offers if you're in an economical state of mind.

It has a really nice menu with decent food and wine at reasonable prices, which is a recipe for success in an area like Katong/Joo Chiat. It's flabbergasting how many other similar venues failed in this neighborhood because they didn't get the price/quality balance right, and Wine Connection has to be commended for not assuming that just because there's more expats living here, there's a market for European food at 30+ dollars a dish, and wine at 15+ dollars a glass.They do a lot of things right, from, again, reasonable prices for reasonable food and wine, to a pretty well done interior that gives the right ambiance, to - finally - reasonably late opening hours, something unheard of in this still pathetically early closing neighbourhood! Yes everyone else on east coast road and Joo Chiat, are you listening? If you want to ever become the Holland Village of the east, last order at 9:30 won't cut it.Now, to my biggest, and only issue with Wine Connection, which is a total deal breaker: the noise. This place is popular, and generally quite full, and the interior architect who was responsible for making this place look trendy-hip seems to have gone to great lengths to carefully choose materials that are sure to create the absolute maximum possible reverb, with everyone's voices bouncing off tiled floor, glass/concrete walls, making this place about as loud as the runway at Changi. Having dinner with spouse becomes an eternal 'say again' match, unless you're willing to join in with everyone else and scream your voice hoarse.Wine Connection would be an easy 4 star, but unless the noise is addressed - and it's not so hard, use fabric on the ceiling and it will be much better - it's a 3."

Giving it 4 stars for the following reasons:1. Food quality: They are well known for their tonkatsu sets and they don't disappoint. Their tonkatsu sets are delicious and one of the better ones that you can find in SG. Love their black and white sesame seeds which I always have fun grounding into powder form. Add some yuzu sauce to the grounded sesame and it becomes a perfect dip for the katsu, enhancing its taste tremendously. The tartar sauce that they serve is also really delicious and they will readily give you 2nd helpings if you ask for them.2. Free flow of shredded Cabbage: They are very generous with their shredded cabbage and the wait staff will come round to top up for you again and again. Gotta ask them to stop as one just cannot eat that much cabbage. The sesame and yuzu sauce go very well with the cabbage, making it a really refreshing side dish which helps to balance the taste of the meat dishes.3. Service: Service is friendly, adequate and pretty efficient. Probably a 3.5 stars for service overall.4. People Watching and Admiring Art in motion: The seats are comfortable, especially when you can get the booth seats. If you are seated at the booth seats, you can have a meal while enjoying the action - watching folks checking in at the airline counters at the departure hall below. I always try to get the booth seats and have been lucky to get them in all my past visits. It is also really fun to watch the very impressive art installation Kinetic Rain while dining here.Really into sake (especially hot sake) recently. So, would definitely be returning to Saboten to satisfy my cravings for hot sake and mouth-watering tonkatsu quite soon."

I ordered the pork loin on rice curry set. The panko on the pork and the pork itself were cooked really well. It was nice and crispy on the outside with a perfect color and the pork was nice and juicy and not at all oily. The curry was an average mild curry. I wish there was an option for a hot/spicy curry.

I headed down for dinner with the family and ordered more dishes to try.For starters, their ebi is still good at this branch. In fact, so good that my mum had seconds. I like that their prawns was melt in your mouth which adds a nice balance to the crispy batter. The tonkatsu was less than fantastic at this branch which is quite a shame since that was what I really raved about. The bits of oily skin inside which made it rather gross. I thought the one at Millenia Walk was done better with firmer meat to batter ratio and no skin in the cutlet. Tried the mentai cutlet, thought that was okay, nothing to write home about so stick to their original sets. The rice was fluffy and fragrant with fresh shredded cabbages that I love to pair with their sesame sauce. Icecream was the same though in a smaller scoop but that's no biggie. Service is just as polite but I just wished it was easier to get their attention since the service at Milennia Walk's branch was outstanding.

If you like it slightly wet, stocked in rich stock, this Hokkien Mee will work for you. I liked that they pair the yellow noodles with thin vermicelli (most places use thick vermicelli). You get more flavour and less starchy, plus the dish does not dry up as easily and you can enjoy the rich prawn broth with every bite! All the seafood added into the dish was cooked for the right bite so you don't have to worry about rubbery seafood.This is good even for takeaway, the Hokkien Mee stays wet from the rich broth."

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.A must dish is the local meal called ""Oluak"" aka oyster omelette from Green Sky food stall, which is one of the best you'll have in the whole of Singapore for my liking, which not only has generous servings of oysters but also their unique way of cooking it up and the textures are very different that the run of the mill ones, in that it's super crispy and crunchy.From the same stall, you can get a pretty good Char Kway Teow which is usually some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and although it wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.The usual satay store that we frequent was sold out by the time we arrived but the one we ate at Stall 11 Ayam Penyet (which translates to ""flat chicken"") didn't disappoint either and the mutton was full of flavour and and these segments of fat that were sweet and so more-ish. If you don't like fat, pass the satay stick on to someone that does. The sauce was nice too but like it's hard to find a bad pizza or bagel in New York, the same can be said for satay but be aware that there are many variations, depending upon the specific influences and regions grounding the chef.For dessert we had our traditional fare of Ais Kacang aka Ice Kacang and Cendol. Ice Kacang is basically shaved ice with flavourings of rose syrup and Gula Melaka (palm sugar) and the kacang part which is usually seaweed grass jelly and red beans and inevitably has attap chee or palm seeds and corn adorning the top. When you go to a beverage shop, they will usually serve hot and cold drinks as well as the refreshing ice kacang but it's almost like a Sizzler smorgasbord in that you can pick and choose what goes into your ice kacang. The cendol looks like little green worms but taste far from it and are sweet rice flour noodles coloured an iridescent green and often paired with coconut.Overall it has to be good if we keep going back there. There's definitely better Kway Teow for my tastes in town but the food stalls at Bedok Corner have yet to disappoint."

The Fried Prawn Mee is stewed in a rich stock, and holds a relatively strong taste of lard. Ye Lai Xiang, possibly the most famous stall there, occupies 2 stall spaces.

The brown sauce is not as spicy as I'd like it to be, but, good enough for that shiok factor. The crushed peanuts adds a good texture to this very satisfying dish. 2. Chicken rice at Tong Fong Fatt*I'm a Muslim so I have not eaten much authentic non-halal hainanese chicken rice*I've always preferred the hainanese chicken rice over the Malay chicken rice as the latter tends to be greasy with almost everything fried. This plate of chicken rice from TFF is amazing - rice is fragrant and fluffy, the steamed chicken is soft and succulent (you have a choice of roasted or steamed), the soup is alright and the garlic chilli adds a nice balance to the whole dish."

He was pouring huge pots of drinks while also taking peoples orders which was very mesmerizing and impressive. It wasn't all for show either because the teh was delicious! Actually, everything was good. We got the classics: curry noodles, nasi lemak and kaya toast. The two entrees also came with a slice of cake each so I got the Kaya and kopi flavors. The kaya one was my favorite!! Super thick buttercream and not too sweet. I came back again when flying out of the airport and tried their mee reebus which was also very tasty - it's like curry gravy.

Eating there is also much more peaceful compared to the hubbub of the food court just down the hall.3.5/5 Food: My first time stopping by, I ordered the chicken donburi. It didn't taste anything remotely Japanese. It was more like a bland version of a Hong Kong chicken clay pot dish.My second time, I ordered the sashimi bento box and I liked that so much better. It came with 6 slices of sashimi, rice, miso soup, fruit, okra, and salad. Tbh, not the best sashimi I've had, but it was a simple and filling meal, so I left happy.4/5 Service: Multi-lingual servers who are attentive but not intrusive.Overall, definitely not the best Asian food I've ever had, but for airport food, it's not bad at all."

It worked well with me but may not for others who prefer thicker soups. I also had the Truffle Capellini with organic egg. It was delicious, with the truffle not overwhelming and just right. The egg was a good mix with the capellini. As for my partner, she had the mussels with spicy cream.

Bar Stories deserves a post of it's own - it's one of the most unique and memorable bars that I've visited, in any of the cities that I've lived in. It's sister outlet, Table Manners, has a unique selling point - the creativity of Bar Stories combined with the coffee crafting expertise of Papa Palheta. This would be a potent combination in any part of Singapore, but particularly so in an area that until recently had been starved of quality coffee. As always, I ordered an espresso and a cappuccino, two drinks that tell me a lot about the quality of coffee in any given cafe, bar or restaurant. The espresso shot was thick, with definite hints of citrus. This gave rise to a full bodied aftertaste that lingered long after the last drops of espresso had been gulped down. It seemed thicker and more potent than a regular shot - more akin to a ristretto - this was a shot that was extracted for the correct eighteen to thirty second extraction time. This may seem like a minor point, but it's an important one - it's harder to make bad coffee with a good espresso foundation.The shot had a medium dark crema, which lined the side of the cup. It's interesting to note that a lot of the perceived bitterness in an espresso shot comes from the crema itself. If you carefully scoop the crema from a fresh espresso shot, it should taste extremely tart. Crema which clings to the side of a cup will not impart as much of this sharp flavour to a shot. This was a good shot by any standard, but it would also be a good shot for anyone who has not tried espresso shots before, or for anyone who has been turned off espresso by bad shots in franchise chain cafes.    The cappuccino has a thin layer of foam, closer to that seen on a latte. As a result, the smooth and silky mouthfeel was reduced, making this a lighter cappuccino (I prefer mine stronger), but the quality of the drink was not overly diminished. One issue is that teacups are being used rather than coffee cups - the difference being that tea cups have very thin walls, and as a result, heats dissipates much more quickly (I'm a science geek. I can't help but notice these things). Combined with the overhead fans above, coffees can lose heat quite quickly, and this has a significant effect on the quality of coffee served. It's worth pointing out that coffees in Table Manners are no more expensive than those in franchise chains. Why waste good money on bad coffee when Table Manners has Papa Palheta's beans? However, prices on the take away menu need to be updated. A latte is listed as costing $5, but actually costs $5.90 - this should be an easy thing to fix, but it's still there. Latte art is always a welcome sight, as it tells me that the baristas were trained to a high standard, and trained to care about quality coffee. This is consistent with my comments on the espresso shot being prepared correctly. The light dusting of cocoa powder ensured that little sweetness was imparted, and that the cocoa flavour accentuated rather than dominated the drink.The food menu is worth a mention also - there is a good selection of starters, main courses and deserts, and an interesting menu that allows items to be paired according to the customers preferences. The prices are fair - they are certainly not overpriced - another point in their favour.In a nutshell, the bright young staff at Table Manners are serving up quality coffee, made from quality beans in a quirky and interesting bar and restaurant. Bar Stories younger sibling is already off to a good start....but change the cups and update the prices on the take away menu!"

I ordered the set lunch with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, salad, and strawberry shortcake.When my order arrived, they had given me mushrooms instead of potatoes.  I brought it to the servers attention.  He took my plate away and quickly returned.  They had simply added maybe two spoons worth of mashed potatoes to my plate.  Come on, potatoes are one of the least expensive foods in the world and, after making a mistake on my order, they skimp on them.The fried chicken was pretty good.  It was certainly not the traditional fried chicken that I kind of expected.  It was prepared more like chicken fried steak. It was a large boneless piece of chicken pounded out, breaded and fried.   It was nothing to write home about but I liked it.tinyurl.com/93wn6a2The strawberry shortcake was a fresh, light, and refreshing dessert.tinyurl.com/96shz52Overall, this is a basic place.  It is much like the restaurants next to it (Moa and Lavaedge).  It is not an inexpensive lunch.  But, it doesn't empty your wallet either.  Out of convenience (close to work), I might go back.  However, it is definitely not a place to venture out of your way to visit."

I almost lost my way in the mall while trying to locate TM. Without any visible signage and especially difficult when the mall has quite a number of small exits around. I don't seem to be able to spot the restaurant until I reached the open space - a small garden-like area. There, I saw a black outdoor gazebo dining area with an open counter featuring a prominent ""pigeon-hole"" backdrop. I knew I have found it and walk right up. I was greeted by a zealous wait staff at the door, who explained the ordering instructions patiently and thereafter showed me to the indoor seats.Entering the dining hall, it is the democratic design that I saw. I could imagine how the people behind TM conceptualized the area, decking out in modernistic Scandinavia-inspired furniture characterized by simplicity and practicality. The ""piecemeal"" communal table stood out from the space, without looking cluttered. The area was highlighted by the wall shelving with potted plants, retail pieces stuffed in each pigeon holes. Fitted mostly in pressed wood, the room was made less formal with a sense of nature integration. The first thing that comes to mind is Ikea, this group of Swedish makes really sensible tools with a small price tag.Lunch is served in a mix-and-match manner, where it comes with 4 main categories; ""fibers"" - Staples & Vegetables, ""protein"" - Seafood & Meat. You can choose to have the lightest meal with 3 fibers for $9.50 or the hearty combination of 2 fiber and 2 protein for $19.00. of course, if these ain't going to fill you, get some add-ons and pay additional $3.50 - $7.50. I customized my plate with a mid-sized combo plus 1 add-on & a dessert to end the meal.The lightly salted Truffle fries are so addictive that I can't stop but emptied the bowl within a short 10 minutes. Each string was deep fried to crisp and I liked the fact that they are cut fatter than any shoe-strings yet sliced slimmer than the regular straight fries. Smell of comfort, less gasoline taste - a great snack packed in umami-rich aromas. Go for potato wedges if truffle fries seem less idolizing.The Chopped Pumpkin Salad came with a decent portion of fresh greens. Never mind if the diced pumpkin looks miserable, a generous toss of that tangy salad dressing add scores to the boring greens. I was looking for a sweet flavour in the pumpkin but the morsels were too tiny to taste.The Cajun seasoning lends a sweet and spicy scent to the sizable chicken thigh. One incision and you witnessed how moist and tender the meat was roasted, with the bursting juices oozing out onto the plate. It was quite close to what I have eaten at Amuse, a delicious piece of bird meat. Other ""protein"" like beef stroganoff, pork cutlet, pesto fish fillet and burger steak, are available as well. There's nothing you won't choose.That additional fiber I had - Spaghetti Pomodoro akin tomato sauce was equally tasty. The pasta had a good boil, yielding a springy bit but it will be perfect if it was cooked Al dente. Every strand was coated in the mildly acidic tomato sauce, fair amount of concentrate yet not overly seasoned. Sometimes when I am really unlucky, I get some bad tasting pasta that either comes with a chunk of soggy noodles or a pool of unpalatable watery sauce. Here, no slipshod piece of work seen.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/t…What is a complete meal without a sweet ending? You've guess it! A chocolate-caramel war. Undoubtedly, the sweet course didn't come cheap, ranging from $6.50 - $7.50. But I am willing to foot the price if it tastes divine. I am split between a Strawberry Shortcake and the chocolate tart. In the end, the latter succeeded in talking me over. Fabulous piece of tart. The shortcrust crumbles neatly on my plate each time I forked right through. The highlight was that chilled chocolate fillings - soft and chewy. The cocoa flavour was explosive, so intense. Each mouthful was gooey when the chocolate fused with that sticky caramel substance in the middle. Flavour becomes good when it has a lot of layering and this Sea Salt Chocolate Caramel Tart depicts that - speechless.Coffee addict will not leave TM without a good Papa Palheta dose. The potion was rich, aromatic, not acrid - truly a stimulant. Not a fan on coffee? How about a cup of tea from Tea Forte? And if you are in the mood for some cocktails, they have the so-called popular drinks from Bar Stories presented in 5 groupings, that is, sweet, spicy, sour, bitter, and intriguingly to chill you.Though lesser known by diners, you could pick up anything from this retail-cum-cafe that fits a housewarmin"

Almost every dish was below expectations considering the prices. The only exception was the mushroom soup that came with the set.

There's some suggested combinations if you want to know what goes together, otherwise you can take a punt and hope they all go together. I got the salmon with a side of broccoli and mixed vegetables. I need greenery and this sounded like a healthy option. Sadly the vegetables came slathered in butter/oil and the salmon had a creamy dressing on top. It tasted fine but my tastebuds certainly weren't delighted. Next time I'll choose my combo more carefully.What I really loved about Table Manners was the fitout. I love the interior of this place - kind of like a Scandinavian library feel (not that I have any idea what the libraries look like in Scandinavia). There's free wifi and a chilled vibe, so it's also the perfect place to sit for a while if you need to have a meeting or do some work."

It's not trying to do too much, and with what they do do, they do it well.Our gang of six had a couple of different options, and all of us polished out plates - the truffle capellini had great flavour, and that yolk seemd to bind the flavours together, while my Louisiana fried chicken was not so much Southern, yet a very well battered and fried chop, so I didn't really have a lot to complain about. With very reasonable prices and a daily three-hour happy hour deal, you'll find a reason to come back."

If you want a little more intimacy, then you can opt to sit at the row of tables at a corner of the room. Outdoor seating is in a bird cage like gazebo just outside the restaurant.Onto the food. Enjoyable and hearty western cuisine. I was eyeing the Angus beef steak with truffle fries but it was sold out. Had the pork cutlet with aioli which was quite good. Very juicy and tasty. The baked salmon also won the boy's vote with its flavorful sauce. Drinks are from Bar stories, a sister company of Table Manners! There's happy hour from 5-8pm every day. Awesome!!

Started 2 sides (crusted oysters and baby squid calamari) while waiting for our 3 mains (platter combo, seafood spaghetti, seafood & chicken jambalaya). The pork ribs are tender and slides off the bones. Hubby loved the Cajun sauce. The other mains are only so-so. The guys are still not full and ordered the spicy wings and other portion of the baby squid calamari. The spicy wings are using the Cajun sauce again so hubby is thrilled again. (Although one of my guests think it's too spicy). The baby squid calamari is a favorite that we had to order a second portion. Apparently this dish is a sneak preview and will be introduced next year. Overall, the taste is decent. Although, I can't agree with the other reviews that the price is value for money."

It was one of his favorite dishes so I thought it was worth giving it a try. Bak Ku Teh (Pork rib soup) is one of the signature dishes of Singapore. You'll find that breakfast is somewhat of a liberal concept here- - it goes beyond just pancakes and eggs. If it's served in the morning, there's no reason it can't be breakfast. No one will look twice as you're devouring a hearty bowl of pork ribs for your morning nourishment.PORK RIB SOUPThe soup was peppery, garlicky and served piping hot. The pork ribs were fall off the bone-tender. A side of Youtiao (Chinese Donut) is great for dipping into the broth after you've finished the ribs. While the soup had a good kick it was unfortunately, just ok. SPICY PORK BELLYBraised pork belly served in a clay pot was tender however, a bit dry and too sweet. I found the chili infused soy sauce helped balanced out the sweetness but didn't do much for the dish overall. If I'm being honest, this is a pass for me. While this particular meal wasn't anywhere near my favorite, the soup would be best eaten when it's cold out."

PRAWN PANCAKE- Deep fried prawns with a thin crispy exterior was tasty. PORK CHOP FRIED RICE- The pork chops were well seasoned over the fragrant rice was superb.

Came across this place and menu looked good so we went in. The item which I hadn't experienced before was a little holder for my bag. It made for sitting at a little table better as I didn't have to balance my bag and I didn't have to hang it on the back of my chair. Clever. We ordered one of the steamed truffle and pork dumpling - a wee little thing which cost $5. I didn't want to order five in case we didn't enjoy it. My son chose the chicken dumplings. The food took a while to come and we were starving by then. The truffle dumpling was definitely worth it. I wish we had ordered more as it was better than the chicken dumplings. It features black truffles with fresh pork wrapped in the dumpling skin. And included rice broth in it so the liquid burst into your mouth when you bit into the dumpling. Delicious. We also had wontons and fried rice. Those were yummy too. Would go back next time we get a chance to visit Singapore.

Love the juicy succulent patty that is contrasted by the sharp special sauce. My favorite has got to be their breakfasts though. I would compare the portion to Jones', slightly smaller but this is half the price of what you pay there. Value for money or what? Lots used to do meats so the sausages are good. Looks a bit on the thin side but it's juicy and fragrant. The blueberry pancakes are fluffy and moist on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. I love the pancakes because they are not overly thick. I don't usually take pancakes because the taste gets boring after a while. Tried different pancakes from WH, Prive etc but i never liked them. FfT's is not bad but this is better. Go for blueberry, it's not as dry as the others.  The iced mocha is also one of the better ones i've had. I would put this after Jones' (or at the same spot).

Very fresh.Deep fried prawns in beancurd skin is nice and fresh.Hotplate otah is nice.Tong po rou could be softer.Sambal kang kong is nice.

We decided to check it out as none of us have been there although it seemed to be a popular seafood restaurant in Simpang Bedok. They are super packed and even provide valet services as parking is limited here.I am very intrique by the wall of crab shells graffti that their customers have left behind. Tucked away in the east, we tried some of their popular dishes like the salted egg crabs and the KL hokkein mee, pretty yummy and we were not disappointed. Definitely worth coming back and checking out their other dishes. I love how the management at this chain restaurants name their chain stores pretty catchy. This particular one is call big eater seafood, they have the other outlets by the name of Grand Eater  and Master Crab."

The crabs are firm and fresh, though the experts will tell you not to order when the moon is full or something like that. The salted egg yolk crab is better than the chili, while he KL hokkien mee is a happy heart attack on a plate; a mess of black stringy noodles and liberally sprinkled with lard. Oh so good.

This explains the long lines that snake past the store every lunchtime on the weekdays and throughout the day on the weekends - I would say that they are un-rivalled in the east. Although always busy, the owners take the time to get every order perfect, with give you the part of the chicken that you prefer if it is available. As it is a small store with only 2 or 3 people working in it, and with a high demand, prepare to wait for your chicken rice - I had to wait in line for about 20 minutes the last time I went, but it was worth it :)"

They have so many different stalls that offer at least 4-25 or so options each. It took me a long time to decide and I didn't even get the chance to check out everything.Saw the noodle soup and my eyes got fixated. I had the combination noodle soup, with a side of fried jumbo fish ball. The food looks better than it tastes. The noodle soup could use more salt, and the fish ball could use a better dipping sauce too. Overall, I was a little disappointed, but still enjoyed the food. The biggest win was the freshly juiced mango and guava cup that I had. It was so good I would have gotten another one (and try more food) if I wasn't already running late for my connection flight.Overall, don't let the overall rating scare you off.

When you reach the entrance of the food court, there are a couple of sign boards that tells you to purchase a card as the stalls doesn't accept cash payment. Doesn't make sense for foreigners and in fact it's inconvenient. Why? You have to queue up twice - to purchase the card and seek a refund for it (or you can keep it), but for those who don't like collecting cards, refunding it for cash is probably the option. Why not allow cash payment at the counters instead? The prices of the food are overpriced, but what do you expect at airports, it's usually like that everywhere. I had the chicken rice ($6.50) and it's average, not really to my liking. For those on stop-overs, it's good to have a taste of Singaporean food, I guess that's the purpose of this food court.

If you load too much money, they'll give refunds, but only in SGD.  The one thing I wanted, which was Hainan chicken rice, was CLOSED.  Sad face.  I settled for the roast duck and roast pork plate and shared the combination dry noodle with with my friend.  The food looks so amazing in the photos, but were pathetic when they served the dish on the counter.  The portions were only 50% of what was pictured and the quality left more to be desired. If you're laying over in the airport and are super desperate to get a taste of Singapore food, I guessssss you could eat here.  Otherwise, stay away."

I had the pulled duck macaroni which was made with 3 different types of cheese. Satisfying but a bit filling for one given the generous amounts of cheese heaped on the macaroni. My partner had the salted egg yolk pasta, which was cutely served in a jar. Didn't try it but she enjoyed it. Both our meals were served with a small side salad that was drizzled with wasabi teriyaki sauce. Couldn't appreciate the peculiar flavour but to each his own! :)Topped up $2 for earl grey tea and $5 for a jar cake"

YOU WILL SEE ANOTHER COFFEE BEAN!! and right next to it, fart tartz cafe!! :) It is a cute cafe, with sofa seats, high bar counter top seats too.. and the bloom tarts :D They're soo cute, although they looked bigger on photos, they're actually palm sized. We ordered a matcha and a oreo nutella one, based on the shops' recommendation. at $5.50 nett, I can't complain too much. It was fun to cam whore with the ""potted plants"" and you get to keep the fake flower.. hurray for my mother! and we dug in!! :) the matcha was light and you could still taste the green tea flavour. The oreo nutella was a winner, I mean.. who doesn't like nutella? it's a winner on it's own.. at the bottom of the flower pot, there is a an actual chunk of the oreo, with the cream filling.. :) all in all a nice treat.. although I wouldn't bother taking 1hr 40 mins worth of train rides just for this.. but if you are in the area, do give it a try!"

I would definitely buy the whole cake if I could! *Durian Ice CreamThis is the real deal! A big sign was put up there stating that it's a ""die die must try"" item. Ugh I mean, how can I just leave without trying it? It comes in two sizes: medium sized pint or small pint. I went with the latter. Wow, my mind was blown away! It was so velvety and rich! You could really taste the durian dancing on your taste bud! A must try indeed! I kept thinking to myself that I should've gotten the bigger pint. Oh well, next time! They also have different durian-inspired offerings such as durian hot pot (yes, for real), durian pancake, durian spring rolls, and many more! If you're looking for gifts to bring home, they sell different durian products (chips, dried durian, kaya jam, candies, cookies, etc.)I would definitely recommend this place to durian lovers out there!

Her cravings for noodles...is as demonic as my cravings for Pampangan Sisig. So I was game. I caved in and followed her even though the last 20+ times I've had any bak chor mee out and about had been a sheer disappointment that made me ask...""where the bloody hell did all the good *shi-fu-level-peeps* go?""She insisted on ordering for me and made me sit like a little bish at the only table available in another overcrowded part of Singapore [surprise...surprise]. She is an older sister to me so I have to listen...I have to obey. But guess what? I skipped being part of a 30+ minute line. These motherfarters are slow at 1930 hrs. Really slow. She was probably 10th in line...but 30 minutes before she got to order and FOR NOODLES??? You've got to be bloody joking!

I did see right after all!Yet, let's put it this way.That farter is alive and still cooking in hungry Singapore because what he brought out...was indeed worth the $4'ish dollars we paid per bowl. He's alive because the liver and minced pork brought loving flavors and a soup so hearty [from hundreds of plunged-to-cook-pork] that it made my heart slow down. He's alive because the freaking noodles seduced my tongue with each nibble and returned my need for bak chor mee in Singapore. He's alive...well...because people forget his snail-act the moment they plow into his food.So they are obviously not close to perfect [and probably brought some shame into the original which I now have to try]...but I'm still a fan because I'd eat this 30-minute-line-bowl-of-bak-chor-mee any freaking given day of my life here in Singapore.

If you are not sure, look for the Apple store or the Muji store, and you will find Shake Shack about 50m away. There used to be horrendous 1-2 hr queues when it first opened. But now, you should be able to get to place your order within 5 to 30 minutes of joining the queue of hungry patrons.SERVICEWith the covid-19 social distancing measures, the only service you experience is when you're queuing to get in and also when you are making your order at the cashier. Other than that, there is no other interaction with the staff. Good and bad perhaps. There is a self service automated hand washing machine around the middle of the restaurant, so that's as close as you get to somone washing your hands for you.FOOD & DRINKSThe special item in Singapore is the Pandan Shake. Just reading the item on the menu gave me a toothache. I might give it a try one day when I need a sugar rush...one day. The Hamburger feels a bit over priced at $7.50 for a basic item. The meat free Shroom Burger ($10.80) is quite good too with a light crispy mushroom patty.Personal favourite items are the crinkle cut fries and Shack Burger ($9.20 single & $14.40 for the double).

While the beef patty itself is average, what really makes this burger standout is the overall quality ingredients including the burger bun, secret sauce, cheese, and bacon. Highly recommend the Smoke Shack which includes the cheese, bacon, and red peppers. Regarding the wait time. If you go during their peak times (weekends all day & weekdays lunch rush) you could wait up to an 1 hour. For  off peak times less than 15 mins."

So I got the smoke shack, milk shakes - peanut butter and the festive shakes, cheesy fries and concretes Shack Attack. The Smoke Shack was with bacon. I was disappointed with the bacon as it was tough not the crispy type. My fellow diners whom had the same felt the same disappointment. You imagine trying to eat some bark, that's what the applewood bacon was like - they must have removed the Apple and left the wood there. Minus 1  . The burger was not put together properly as in you do not get the cherry peppers evenly spread. So in one of my bite I took all the peppers, that was very spicy. Minus 1  for badly put together burger. The holiday cookie shake was like a sugar frozen yogurt. It was totally overly horribly sweet yogurt until the cookie crumbs that was only at the bottom 3 mm of the shake and you get the few cookie crumbs. It would be much better if there were more cookies crumbs. Minus 1 I easily found a table upstairs but as usual the normal locals here don't clean up their mess. There was like 4 staff standing waiting to wipe the tables but do not help clearing the table. They did not even help open the trash box flap when I took all the trash there. Standing like a block of wood.  Sure it is Boxing Day but you choose to come back to work, so get working. However they did wiped off the table. Minus 1 Ok something good must be said here, otherwise I run out of  and I have not even talk about the weird tables/chairs layout. The peanut butter shake was good, not the best or like those in US but for local establishment it is good. Overall the food seems over rated. Or may the hype just too much that I expected perfect food. It is just a so so establishment. I probably go there for the shake again and not the burger."

None of that for Shake Shack. For once, this burger place, on a morning 10.30am crowd, feels a bit like a club, a gathering place, a temple, like an Apple store in the past, of sorts.Yes, this might be a club for burgers and milkshake, much like the Apple store just a few feet away is to a haven for technology.If you wanna have brunch, come in before 10.30am and the queue won't be so bad. We waited for only about 20 mins (queueing and waiting for food altogether) and we were very lucky to have a seat very quickly. We finished our brunch at around 11am.The burger is really like totally opposite of what I used to love - Carl's Junior. None of that messy, cheesy, huge big fat patty. Its packaging may not seem big but it's filling for me (I ordered the single patty). I saw many people actually ordering the double patty. The bun was really high quality, the vegetables fit in just well, not too much and not too little. The patty supposedly tastes higher quality as well. Overall its a premium package burger. Some people might not be impressed as there is no 'kick' or 'wow' factor right off the bat. But when you bite into that clean non-messy-at-all burger and you remembered those days when your jeans had all that spilt sauce from your burger, you might appreciate this experience better. For me, I'd choose this any day. Yes some may say this is expensive. But I like that there is no silly convulated pricing and you do get the quality through in the burger and the milkeshakes, where I suppose shackburger and shakes is where its name derives from.Being impressed I'd give this a 4.5/5.+5 is from their quality, cleanliness, atmosphere, smiley service crew, good shackburger, milkshakes and drinks. You leave feeling good.-0.5 is from overtly-salty fries, not much option on condiments (only ketchup and mustard) and also price could be a bit prohibitive for some."

Had a line so must mean it's good right? Who knows as at an airport people sometimes choose convenience. Turned out pretty tasty. He had the chicken rendang set and I had the mee rebus set. The set came with a choice of drink and we selected barley instead of tea or coffee. He said his chicken rendang tasted good and it did look good. Not a huge portion but enough. My mee rebus wasn't to my taste and was different than the preparation I had growing up. Could be that it's a regional difference between Singapore and Malaysia.

The bun was pillowy and as someone who eats pulled pork from the American south, I would happily put this in front of any of my southern friends with the perfect assurance they will love it. For me I had the crawfish Kuay Tiao (wise rice noodle) with a side of achar.  The  dish was a perfect amalgamation of street style char kuay tiao with a luxurious flair with the crawfish addition. Finally dessert. Oh heaven wept. Pandas cake so soft hubs was afraid it may collapse. My Ondeh with durian was so soft and sublime. Warm pandan crepe filled with durian, top with cool ice cream. Heaven really wept!!!! Service was top notch too.So run don't walk to this gem!!!!"

Stepping inside, you'd doubtlessly feel transported into the 60s. Nay, 50s. Food:Overall, quite a number of stand outs. (1) bakwang kepiting soup. Now, I found the broth a little strange. Too much fried shallots. However, the crab meat and minced meat paste was fabulous, sitting on a crab shell. I enjoyed it greatly. My sis didn't. Ah well. Can't please everyone! $5 each person, minimum two people. (2) Ayam buah keluak. I genuinely loved the buah keluak!!!! I dug it out with my spoon and usually it's just the nutty earthy meat. But at this place, I believed they stuffed the nut with other spices and mixed the buah keluak meat with minced meat! In any cAse, it was sedap!!!! (3) sambal udang (prawns). Yummmmmmmm. (4) chili fries pomfret. Crispy and fresh. Reminds me of home. All in all, a good meal. My dad wanted chendol but they don't have it!!

The noodle bowls come in three sizes- small, medium, jumbo. You can choose to have your noodles in a soup, or dry (with soup on the side). And from your noodles, you can choose thin rice noodles or chewy egg noodles, or a combination of both! I tried both noodles, and both were cooked to a perfect texture. The broth here has a heavy prawn flavor, and you can tell it's been cooked with rich seafood. Other prawn mee places have broths that barely have prawn flavors to it, and taste mostly like pork. I don't usually drink broth for a noodle soup, but I downed this one like there was no tomorrow. Never in my life have I eaten a bowl of noodles and soup so quickly before.

So good!!! Drove pass and saw such a big crowd and decided to join in. 1. Prawn mee with pork ribs- the broth was great! although they didn't give a lot of noodles. - pork was good. prawns as expected. - pricing per bowl was $5.50-10 (for the jumbo). I think it's quite pricey considering it's a coffee shop open air type place (in Singapore). 2. Ngoh hiong- they shared the coffee shop space (2 units) with a Ngoh Hiong shop. I think it's probably owned by the same people. - Ngoh hiong was good! We ordered the i) you tiao with fishcake, ii) money bags (kinda like a fried wanton), iii) some fried beancurb skin with fishcake (this was so thin & crispy), iv)spring rolls. Everything was great! except the spring rolls (don't bother ordering that). - The red sauce that accompanied the Ngoh Hiong was awesome! sweet yet a little spicy at the same time.Definitely will head back for more prawn mee & ngoh hiong :)Only draw back was the parking - super hard to get a spot! and the parking attendent comes pretty frequently to fine people who were illegally parking on the double yellow lines (be warned)."

Every time I pass this place, it's either bursting at the seams or closed. I've been coming here since I was a kid and the price of the prawn mee, like my girth, has increased exponentially. Which is a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Why would anyone pay upwards of $5 for a bowl of prawn mee, and still have to put in the labour of peeling the shell? Er. That would be me, actually. The soup is thick and flavourful, the pork rib, tender, and the chili powder. Oh, the chili powder. The soup would be incomplete without a couple of heavy handed dashes of spice. Noodles are fairly standard, but it's the soup that delivers a warming kick in the pants. Parking, like most of the Katong/Joo Chiat stretch is treacherous. We've only ever illegal parked there before, and even so, that gives you two lots to play with. Good luck fighting with the hungry hoards over the limited space."

I had the soup version when I was younger but have grown to love the ""dry"" version. You can order your noodles in soup or with soup on the side - the latter makes for a better choice because you will be able to enjoy the rich broth in its original form, especially fantastic when spiced up with a bit of chilli from the noodles. If you are having the noodles dry, mix in some chilli powder and you'll get a kick out of eating this bowl of noodles. There are people who pick the pork ribs and prawn option. You can also request to have your prawns deshelled. But I think the original works super well for me."

Meals seem to consist of about 5 chicken wings per serving, and you have a quite a few styles of seasoning to choose from. We went with the Cajun, the Louisiana rub and one other that I can't remember (something to do with honey?) and aside from the Louisiana being incredibly sour, they were pretty tasty. That said, sour wasn't too bad either. Something different about their wings is that you can order a batch of the boneless variety. Eating boneless chicken wings might be akin to eating nuggets or blasphemy for some people, but we also had to feed a hyperactive baby so boneless works out quite well for us! The burger and fries were also all kinds of yum, and the coleslaw was much better than the Colonel's. The big drawback is that for its price range, it just wasn't very filling. The meal came up to about $10 per person, which puts it between a McDonald's and Carl's Jr... Or about on par with a Wendy's. But those places tend to leave you feeling satisfied and we felt like we could fit in another few chicken wings each. Still, it's worth trying at least once."

I'm a huge Wing Stop fan in the states and I was elated when I was on my way to Mustaffa Centre and came across this place! I quickly ordered some Cajun and Original flavored wings, fries with extra seasoning, and a coke. The wings were different from the states but the flavor was still there. The fries were not up to par and the seasoning was just okay. The service was pretty decent so I guess that deserves an added star...

The service was pretty good, what I thought was a disinterested half asleep employee was actually someone working on paperwork who quickly greeted me and patiently took my order. I say ""patiently"" because there menu and display is a bit confusing. They have a digital menu display that only show promoted combos, suave choices and some add ons, they have free standing promo signs, showing the same thing as the digital menu board. What I couldn't figure out how to order was just wings, it appeared that you could only order combos. Once approaching the counter I figured out from another, countertop menu that you can order ala-carte wings. We lazily ended up ordering the boneless wings, which is actually a good value, no extra charge, a lot more meat. We got three sauces, Honey Smoked BBQ, Original Hot, and Louisiana Rub. The BBQ, was too sticky sweet and not enough smoke flavor, and too much sauce. The original hot was a pretty good buffalo flavor, not too saucy, but well covered. The Louisiana Rub was the best of our three, dry rub, tasty seasoning, nice. The French fries were okay, nothing special not bad. The price seemed a bit high, probably not for a sit down wing restaurant but this is fast food style so there's a disconnect in feeling. The food was prepared to order though. I have another favorite wing place ""Wings World"" but I wouldn't avoid this place and will probably come back."

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although the Char Kway Teow was good here, I don't think the massive line represents how good it was in regards to others we went to and isn't always a measure of quality.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.Although the flavours balanced very well, the Wok Hei wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and this lacked that substance and pow that you get when the Wok Hei is infused to perfection. Given Hill Streets Kway Teow's reputation and a glimpse of how good it could be from my taste, I'll be back again to confirm whether it was an ""off"" day or not but with a 20 minute line, if it's not stellar next time, I won't be back.Cheers!Dave."

After years of mostly trying to avoid this dish for health issues, i very occasionally dig in to this once or twice year only.The queue here is always long and I bought the biggest baddest plate they got which was the $4 portion with an added $1 for seahum totalling to $5. Still tasty, has the wokhei taste people look for in this dish, but not so wet with eggy goodness as it was before. The seahum that day was lacklustre to say the least. Small and shrivelled.Although the queues here still snake till the moment they off their lights... I feel it has turned average.

My research led me to Ya Kun and conveniently this location was close to where we were staying. It was still early so it wasn't super busy when we arrived. We both ordered kaya toast with 2 boiled eggs and iced coffee. My husband ordered peanut butter kaya toast while I stuck toEverything is made it order and our food came out quickly. We tried each other's kaya toast and both preferred the original. It was sweet and tasty. Dipping the toast in the soft boiled eggs is highly recommended. Coffee was good too. I recommend trying kaya toast from this place.

The combo was very filling.  I saw people cracking open the soft boil egg and soak it with bread. But I opt to eat it separately.  Needed a bit of seasoning. They also sell kaya jam here which makes a great souvenir.

And the lady in charges of toasting the breads brought it to be when she's done and she does to all her customers! With a smile and eye contact. Similarly when the cashier thanked me, she made eye contact too. And I noticed that the tables were cleaned up very speedily. So the place is keep clean and neat throughout my stay. And i especially have to mention that the cashier is just as friendly to the supplier who came in to ask if she needs anything. She made eye contact, smiled and thanked him for dropping by.

So on our first morning, we walked over to this location which was close by.While there weren't a ton of people inside, there was a consistent stream of people coming in and out. Most of them seemed to already know what they wanted to order, so I assume they must be regulars.The menu has a variety of toast options, and most people order the set ($4.80), which comes with a toast of your choice, 2 soft boiled eggs (or hard boiled if you ask), and a drink (tea/coffee).We tried both the Steamed Kaya Toast and the Cheese Toast. I loved how warm and fluffy the steamed toast was, which sat comfortably in my stomach. In contrast, the cheese toast was bland, and I really couldn't tell that there was cheese in it. Also the bread was flat, hard and a little on the burnt side.What I also didn't really love, was the 2 eggs. I'm a little iffy about runny eggs, so we asked for them to be cooked fully, which was not a problem, only took a little more time. Even after waiting though, the eggs were still on the undercooked side.In general though, I really enjoyed my first kaya toast in Singapore. This place really provides a quick and cheap way to taste a Singaporean breakfast! Unfortunately I'm not the kind of person to enjoy the eggs, but I can see how other people love it."

I believe it was but it lacked depth and the different sorts of beef (i really missed the pork knuckle and the black pudding) which make me love this Vietnamese noodle soup so much. But hey, it was only 6 S$, so I'll be forgiving and forget the fact that it was a tad salty and greasy for my liking and highlight that it came with a sizable portion of beef, something which is not common in foodcourts.Would I eat this again? Not really, only if I happen to pass by this foodcourt again as it did not look like other options were much better but I would certainly not go out of my way for this.Arguably, I've never been to Vietnam so maybe I am not entitled for having an opinion on how Vietnamese food should taste but I have spend considerable parts of my life eating Pho both at my Vietnamese friends homes and in Vietnamese restaurants in Paris, SoCal and Philly, all of which have sizeable Vietnamese communities so sue me for having an opinion...

This was recommended by the proprietor and I'm glad we took it.- fried rice with salted fish. This tied the meal together. Rice had good wok-fired flavor and the pieces of salted fish gave a nice texture and salty bite. They're like little pieces of fish bacon.Add a large bottle of Tiger, and you've got a fantastic meal.

The restaurant it self is located on Albert St. not Prinsep St. as in Yelp's map. First impression this is quite a big restaurant but very busy even off time.  It is not clean nor dirty, just average of Chinese restaurant. The decoration is also similar to other Chinese's style street restaurant. The owner speak little English but still able to understand and give good food recommendation. Very lovely old lady. The food..looks plane but the taste...magnificent!! I don't know how to describe, its the best Chinese food I had in years. The portion is also quite generous. We ordered every dish medium size but they looks like large size to us. We ate until we are stuff, can't believe we were able to finish all the food. Even more surprising, it taste so good since the first bite till the last. And then came the bill....lest than S$80 for 4big dishes and 2 big bottle or beer thats S$20 for person! Awesome!!"

The main entrance is directly opposite Fortune Center (the yellow and white building along Middle Road) and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al-fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community. If you're coming from the side door, it is just next to Torte café (the brownie is to die for) at the end of Waterloo Street. I've dined at Artichoke a couple of times (both on weekend brunch and dinner) and always had the best time here. For brunch, you need to come for their Mezza platter (perfect for 2) which consist of 4 mezze (usually babaganoush, hummus, beetroot and smoked salmon) and a few slices of toasted bread. I suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive. One portion is never enough all the time! For dinner last night, we had the usual mezze plates of hummus, babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken, burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share. All the mains were delicious and I wished we ordered second or third of the burrata (I can eat burrata everyday). The deep fried cauliflower was amazing too, the best I've tried in Singapore after Pony Dining in Eagle Strret Pier, Brisbane. Flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture. HEAVEN. The grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender. What makes it so special is the garlic puree (no kissing after eating this, so you have been forewarned) that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it. Do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you're into trying something new. I've heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here. Well, I think it all depends on what you order and how you order. They have their best seller - The ""Lambgasm"" - a 2.8kg bone-in-lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at $220. So of course, if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails, the bill will definitely come up to $300 - $400.  The four of us ordered 4 mezze plates, 3 mains with no drinks and we paid a total of $124 ($28 each) last night. Considering the food we ate, the price was relatively cheap and reasonable. And we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice (not extremely full or bloated) and very satisfied with dinner. It can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner, so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment."

Food was great, a nice change from the typical cafe fare; my only gripe was the cold service. We tried:- Cauliflower Sabbich ($22): I personally enjoyed this, though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted/grilled, and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture. This had a slightly soggy feel to it. The Israeli salad provided some tang, which I liked, and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk - would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though. Overall a tasty dish.- Haloumi & Mushrooms ($22): The best dish of the 3, in my opinion. The toast was thick and fluffy, with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms. The best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast - it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado, haloumi and mushroom all in one bite. - Artichoke Fried Chicken ($24): 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns, which went nicely with the garlic whip. Slightly too greasy for me, and the chicken had a hint of honey. Didn't enjoy the coleslaw, but the chicken was flavorful. We didn't finish this.Good quality and novel food, would return to try their intriguing dinner menu!"

In layman's terms, a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting.The food itself is just tremendous. My wife and I started off with the Pita and hummus. It was spot on. Next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder. Wow, simply wow. The meat just fell off the bone after the first cut, which is a testament to how tender it was. Mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs, this dish easily was the star of the meal.  The other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish. It was very good, but surprisingly sweet. I probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash. Nevertheless, these dishes on their own are just fantastic.We topped the dinner off with Artichoke's Neh Neh Pops. I went for the Mango Sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango. After the first bite, it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller.  Common, how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango. Great food, Great Vibe, Great Company.

We were able to make a reservation right before leaving the house. We walked and found this restaurant tucked away with cobblestone-like area leading up to it's entrance. You're immediately greeted by the dessert case and then are seated in either patio or inside space. The ambiance is overall chic/hip. The lighting in the evening is soft and romantic. The food is phenomenal and the service is very good as well. This is one of my favorite tapas joints in Singapore. We started with the red sangria pitcher and then ordered the roasted cauliflower, which had pomegranate. It was so tasty and different! We also got the whole market fish ($34), roasted pumpkin, and humus. They brought out pita, but we were good Paleo kids and didn't touch it. We saved our cheat for the dark chocolate and almond baklava. Delicious. We'll definitely be back."

Great vibe and great music. Most importantly great food. Everything we had was delicious so I will simply list everything we had and all dishes are best to be shared.For mezze we had babaganoush paired with the pita bread, rich but yummy. Had some cured swordfish and fresh figs with goat cheese which were both really refreshing. Would suggest ordering mezze to start! They are small dishes for 2-4 people.For sides we had the feta burrata, broccoli salad, and the green beans and beet. Could pass on these but it is nice to have veggies since all the other dishes are so rich.For mains we had the duck tacos which was messy to eat but yummy and filling. The hot skillet prawns are a must! The lamb shoulder dish was rich and yummy but filling and definitely for sharing.We got hot tea which actually worked so well with our meal because it helped cut the rich flavors between dishes.I definitely recommend this place and would go again and maybe try their weekend brunch.

But not only do I give this jewel a 5 star, but also would go as far as saying, if I were to recommend just one restaurant to have a unique tantalizing food experience in Singapore -- other than the local options like chicken rice & chili crab that everyone must check off their list --  it would've be Artichoke. (But with that being said, I have heard the same thing being said about Burnt Ends -- which I will definitely try soon enough.) Artichoke offers creative dishes, while staying true to the root of its cuisine. (Yes, regardless of how delicious their food is, some restaurants just puzzle me with what cuisine they are serving to me.)  How delicately they pull this off-- amazing. Here goes the breakdown: Hummus (4.5/5) -- No frill. GOOD hummus-- not the watered-down version that makes you question how much of chickpeas is in it. A bit of a bummer that it doesn't come with any pita bread. I know I can just eat spoonful(s) of hummus by itself, but come one, not even one? Pita Bread (4.5/5) -- Served hot. Pita bread served here is on the thicker side. Not too chewy, but I can tell it's good quality & actually understand why this is a separate item to be ordered rather than served on the side, although I complained above on not coming with my hummus order. This is a must order as many of the dishes at Artichoke has sauces that deserves to be wiped to the bottom with this pita bread.  Fresh Fig & Goat cheese (5/5) -- I admit that even from just reading this menu, I knew that I was to fall in love. Fig & goat cheese simply cannot go wrong. But then again, how Artichoke artfully put together fresh fig on a spread of creamy goat cheese was just orgasmic. Feta Burrata (5/5) -- Really fresh & unique twist to the regular burrata dishes. I'd say this is the prime example of what I meant by 'creative while staying true to the root'. Some may argue that burrata is Italian, but adding the feta kick to it absolutely justified its presence on the Mediterranean menu. Innovative & just plain delicious. Hot Skillet Prawn (5/5) -- Jesus. My friend and I almost licked the skillet. 4 HUGE prawns that was better than lobster. Sauce was not to be wasted. I remember this dish being rather salty last time but this time, they were perfect. Have this. Just have it. Slow-roasted Lamb Shoulder (5/5) -- SO SUCCULENT & FULL OF FLAVOR! Another dish that requires pita bread to wash the plate. Lamb was so well-roasted -- the texture of the meat was soft while not mushy. The smell of the lamb was very well controlled (I know for some people the strong smell particular to lamb meat is of problem). Babaganoush (3.5/5) -- Don't get me wrong. Just because I raved about other dishes so much doesn't mean that babaganoush was bad. It was just different from my expectation of creamy dark colored paste. Artichoke's babaganoush made it very obvious that it was made of eggplant (the texture and taste is maintained, unlike other babaganoush I've tried). It was good, but I prefer my creamy dark colored version. Neh Neh pops -- It shows that you don't have to go crazy complicated to come up with a strongly branded item. Neh Neh pop's simple yet alluring presentation along with its hand-packed-looking packaging crafts a sense of craft (no pun intended) -- which draws people, making them ignore the little voice in their head saying 'it's just magnum with bunch of stuffs put all over'. They seem to be actively experimenting with the flavors -- such as Neh-espresso, Cheesecake, etc. Looking forward to all the fun flavors. - Baklava flavor (3/5): I am a huge fan of balkava -- how its crispness is preserved while keeping all the mouth-watering sweetness in between its layers. But really not impressed by this flavor on NehNeh pops. Ice cream wasn't rich either (actually tasted a bit of icy-ness, which is what I taste when ice cream melts & then re-freezes.) I wouldn't go for it. A bit too sweet as baklava's sugary sweetness and ice cream & chocolate's deeper sweetness strikes your tastebuds separately creating a not-so-pleasant overdose of sweetness. - Strawberry pokey (4/5): Contrary to my initial standing that it'd be rather boring, its back-to-basic approach was done very well. I don't think the cover was white chocolate -- which really works for me. I look for a lot of things when visiting a restaurant, but here food speaks for the brand. The ambiance & entirety of experience isn't bad, but not impression-leaving. Food is just so well-done. It is not only delicious, un-pretentious, but also fun. This is combination of using good ingredients, adding succulent flavors, playing with mix of tastes, while not losing touch in presentation."

The entrance to this restaurant is a short alley amongst empty houses. It almost became a quaint place hidden in the middle of busy streets. We were seated outdoor in a lovely garden. Menu was quite interesting - it's probably because I'm not experienced with Middle Eastern food. We had 2 dishes to share and my apology for not having the exact name but they are: 1. a BIG pile of burrata on top of buttery bread - I'm biased from having Osteria Mozza the night before so this can not match up, but I would say it's not too bad 2. salmon pancake - which I thought was quite delicious, a good combination of sweetness from the pancakes and saltiness from the smoked salmon. Artichoke seemed to be very generous with its portion and the two of us were so stuffed after those 2 dishes :)We had a look at the Overdough bakery and everything looked so delicious. I will definitely come back to try some baked goods!"

The décor of this place is quite rustic, and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in New York City where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else.   As for our first experience, we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated (around 2pm). Although I was dying for some fried chicken, the second best thing available on the menu - mushroom scrabbled egg - was just equally delicious. They do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table.Personally I enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch. The menu is bigger - about 10 mezzes and 10 entrees, plus some side dishes. The must haves - pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze, burrata and prawns from the entrée.

We often feel we need our Artichoke fix so we go about once a month. Bjorn does amazing things with food and he doesn't apologize for anything. He constantly tries new flavor combinations and clearly works them out until they are delicious. His cauliflower is something I dream about at night. The fried chicken is out of this world and the prawns are unexplainable you just have to try them for yourself. The ambience is also our favorite because we always feel welcome, comfortable, and relaxed. It's like you are dining in your favorite Uncles house and you don't need to impress anyone.

This is one of those places that makes me think its reviews are all fake. All of the raves of this place must be fake or by people who have no idea what food should taste like. The food here is not ""all that"". Its really not. The reality is that this place has bland food that ""looks and sounds good"". First we ordered the hummus. They say they make it on site. I call BS on that. If they are making it they are doing it wrong. It tastes and looks store bought. Well, not even that good. All they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil. Thats it, its bland, tasteless, and just boring. Next, we had the fried cauliflower, again boring and nothing special. It looks great but has no flavor. After that the fried chicken and beef ribs. They both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through. With the chicken, all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it, the breading, and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce. The ribs were just sweet and tender. None of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat. Finally we had the famous ""sticky date pudding"", this was just taking the piss. Its just watered down peanut butter, with grass jelly, topped with ground up Chinese peanut cakes and sugar. No dates, nothing sticky, and NO flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes. A great example of ""up selling"". They use really cheap ingredients, make it look fancy, and sell it for a ton of money. This last dish made me feel like I was a rube getting fleeced. I bet their food costs are 5%. I wish the food in Singapore was as good as the food in Seoul or Tokyo but its just not. Restaurants like these confirm my opinion. The only good food in Singapore is at Hawker centers. If you go to places like this, its just for atmosphere and not for good food. Its a total waste of money."

The cauliflower was deliciously salted and breaded, and the dressing was tasty.Cuttlefish shawarma, chicken fat dressing, lime ($25) - 3.75 starsThe texture of the cuttlefish was excellent - not too rubbery and grilled just right.

The main entrance is directly opposite Fortune Center (the yellow and white building along Middle Road) and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al-fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community. If you're coming from the side door, it is just next to Torte café (the brownie is to die for) at the end of Waterloo Street. I've dined at Artichoke a couple of times (both on weekend brunch and dinner) and always had the best time here. For brunch, you need to come for their Mezza platter (perfect for 2) which consist of 4 mezze (usually babaganoush, hummus, beetroot and smoked salmon) and a few slices of toasted bread. I suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive. One portion is never enough all the time! For dinner last night, we had the usual mezze plates of hummus, babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken, burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share. All the mains were delicious and I wished we ordered second or third of the burrata (I can eat burrata everyday). The deep fried cauliflower was amazing too, the best I've tried in Singapore after Pony Dining in Eagle Strret Pier, Brisbane. Flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture. HEAVEN. The grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender. What makes it so special is the garlic puree (no kissing after eating this, so you have been forewarned) that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it. Do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you're into trying something new. I've heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here. Well, I think it all depends on what you order and how you order. They have their best seller - The ""Lambgasm"" - a 2.8kg bone-in-lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at $220. So of course, if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails, the bill will definitely come up to $300 - $400.  The four of us ordered 4 mezze plates, 3 mains with no drinks and we paid a total of $124 ($28 each) last night. Considering the food we ate, the price was relatively cheap and reasonable. And we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice (not extremely full or bloated) and very satisfied with dinner. It can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner, so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment."

Food was great, a nice change from the typical cafe fare; my only gripe was the cold service. We tried:- Cauliflower Sabbich ($22): I personally enjoyed this, though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted/grilled, and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture. This had a slightly soggy feel to it. The Israeli salad provided some tang, which I liked, and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk - would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though. Overall a tasty dish.- Haloumi & Mushrooms ($22): The best dish of the 3, in my opinion. The toast was thick and fluffy, with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms. The best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast - it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado, haloumi and mushroom all in one bite. - Artichoke Fried Chicken ($24): 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns, which went nicely with the garlic whip. Slightly too greasy for me, and the chicken had a hint of honey. Didn't enjoy the coleslaw, but the chicken was flavorful. We didn't finish this.Good quality and novel food, would return to try their intriguing dinner menu!"

In layman's terms, a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting.The food itself is just tremendous. My wife and I started off with the Pita and hummus. It was spot on. Next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder. Wow, simply wow. The meat just fell off the bone after the first cut, which is a testament to how tender it was. Mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs, this dish easily was the star of the meal.  The other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish. It was very good, but surprisingly sweet. I probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash. Nevertheless, these dishes on their own are just fantastic.We topped the dinner off with Artichoke's Neh Neh Pops. I went for the Mango Sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango. After the first bite, it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller.  Common, how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango. Great food, Great Vibe, Great Company. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes, but of course order that lamb shoulder again."

But not only do I give this jewel a 5 star, but also would go as far as saying, if I were to recommend just one restaurant to have a unique tantalizing food experience in Singapore -- other than the local options like chicken rice & chili crab that everyone must check off their list --  it would've be Artichoke. (But with that being said, I have heard the same thing being said about Burnt Ends -- which I will definitely try soon enough.) Artichoke offers creative dishes, while staying true to the root of its cuisine. (Yes, regardless of how delicious their food is, some restaurants just puzzle me with what cuisine they are serving to me.)  How delicately they pull this off-- amazing. Here goes the breakdown: Hummus (4.5/5) -- No frill. GOOD hummus-- not the watered-down version that makes you question how much of chickpeas is in it. A bit of a bummer that it doesn't come with any pita bread. I know I can just eat spoonful(s) of hummus by itself, but come one, not even one? Pita Bread (4.5/5) -- Served hot. Pita bread served here is on the thicker side. Not too chewy, but I can tell it's good quality & actually understand why this is a separate item to be ordered rather than served on the side, although I complained above on not coming with my hummus order. This is a must order as many of the dishes at Artichoke has sauces that deserves to be wiped to the bottom with this pita bread.  Fresh Fig & Goat cheese (5/5) -- I admit that even from just reading this menu, I knew that I was to fall in love. Fig & goat cheese simply cannot go wrong. But then again, how Artichoke artfully put together fresh fig on a spread of creamy goat cheese was just orgasmic. Feta Burrata (5/5) -- Really fresh & unique twist to the regular burrata dishes. I'd say this is the prime example of what I meant by 'creative while staying true to the root'. Some may argue that burrata is Italian, but adding the feta kick to it absolutely justified its presence on the Mediterranean menu. Innovative & just plain delicious. Hot Skillet Prawn (5/5) -- Jesus. My friend and I almost licked the skillet. 4 HUGE prawns that was better than lobster. Sauce was not to be wasted. I remember this dish being rather salty last time but this time, they were perfect. Have this. Just have it. Slow-roasted Lamb Shoulder (5/5) -- SO SUCCULENT & FULL OF FLAVOR! Another dish that requires pita bread to wash the plate. Lamb was so well-roasted -- the texture of the meat was soft while not mushy. The smell of the lamb was very well controlled (I know for some people the strong smell particular to lamb meat is of problem). Babaganoush (3.5/5) -- Don't get me wrong. Just because I raved about other dishes so much doesn't mean that babaganoush was bad. It was just different from my expectation of creamy dark colored paste. Artichoke's babaganoush made it very obvious that it was made of eggplant (the texture and taste is maintained, unlike other babaganoush I've tried). It was good, but I prefer my creamy dark colored version. Neh Neh pops -- It shows that you don't have to go crazy complicated to come up with a strongly branded item. Neh Neh pop's simple yet alluring presentation along with its hand-packed-looking packaging crafts a sense of craft (no pun intended) -- which draws people, making them ignore the little voice in their head saying 'it's just magnum with bunch of stuffs put all over'. They seem to be actively experimenting with the flavors -- such as Neh-espresso, Cheesecake, etc. Looking forward to all the fun flavors. - Baklava flavor (3/5): I am a huge fan of balkava -- how its crispness is preserved while keeping all the mouth-watering sweetness in between its layers. But really not impressed by this flavor on NehNeh pops. Ice cream wasn't rich either (actually tasted a bit of icy-ness, which is what I taste when ice cream melts & then re-freezes.) I wouldn't go for it. A bit too sweet as baklava's sugary sweetness and ice cream & chocolate's deeper sweetness strikes your tastebuds separately creating a not-so-pleasant overdose of sweetness. - Strawberry pokey (4/5): Contrary to my initial standing that it'd be rather boring, its back-to-basic approach was done very well. I don't think the cover was white chocolate -- which really works for me. I look for a lot of things when visiting a restaurant, but here food speaks for the brand. The ambiance & entirety of experience isn't bad, but not impression-leaving. Food is just so well-done. It is not only delicious, un-pretentious, but also fun. This is combination of using good ingredients, adding succulent flavors, playing with mix of tastes, while not losing touch in presentation."

The entrance to this restaurant is a short alley amongst empty houses. It almost became a quaint place hidden in the middle of busy streets. We were seated outdoor in a lovely garden. Menu was quite interesting - it's probably because I'm not experienced with Middle Eastern food. We had 2 dishes to share and my apology for not having the exact name but they are: 1. a BIG pile of burrata on top of buttery bread - I'm biased from having Osteria Mozza the night before so this can not match up, but I would say it's not too bad 2. salmon pancake - which I thought was quite delicious, a good combination of sweetness from the pancakes and saltiness from the smoked salmon. Artichoke seemed to be very generous with its portion and the two of us were so stuffed after those 2 dishes :)We had a look at the Overdough bakery and everything looked so delicious. I will definitely come back to try some baked goods!"

The seasonal beef special reminds me of the specialty back in my hometown, Taiwan - the famous beef noodles.

The décor of this place is quite rustic, and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in New York City where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else.   As for our first experience, we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated (around 2pm). Although I was dying for some fried chicken, the second best thing available on the menu - mushroom scrabbled egg - was just equally delicious. They do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table.Personally I enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch. The menu is bigger - about 10 mezzes and 10 entrees, plus some side dishes. The must haves - pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze, burrata and prawns from the entrée. It's not a late night place as their last kitchen call comes before 9:30."

We often feel we need our Artichoke fix so we go about once a month. Bjorn does amazing things with food and he doesn't apologize for anything. He constantly tries new flavor combinations and clearly works them out until they are delicious. His cauliflower is something I dream about at night. The fried chicken is out of this world and the prawns are unexplainable you just have to try them for yourself. The ambience is also our favorite because we always feel welcome, comfortable, and relaxed. It's like you are dining in your favorite Uncles house and you don't need to impress anyone.

The food here is not ""all that"". Its really not. The reality is that this place has bland food that ""looks and sounds good"". First we ordered the hummus. They say they make it on site. I call BS on that. If they are making it they are doing it wrong. It tastes and looks store bought. Well, not even that good. All they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil. Thats it, its bland, tasteless, and just boring. Next, we had the fried cauliflower, again boring and nothing special. It looks great but has no flavor. After that the fried chicken and beef ribs. They both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through. With the chicken, all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it, the breading, and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce. The ribs were just sweet and tender. None of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat. Finally we had the famous ""sticky date pudding"", this was just taking the piss. Its just watered down peanut butter, with grass jelly, topped with ground up Chinese peanut cakes and sugar. No dates, nothing sticky, and NO flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes. A great example of ""up selling"". They use really cheap ingredients, make it look fancy, and sell it for a ton of money. This last dish made me feel like I was a rube getting fleeced. I bet their food costs are 5%. I wish the food in Singapore was as good as the food in Seoul or Tokyo but its just not. Restaurants like these confirm my opinion. The only good food in Singapore is at Hawker centers. If you go to places like this, its just for atmosphere and not for good food. Its a total waste of money."

Dinner should be fine though.  I was quite surprised by how big the space is inside.  I have passed by several times when I visited Objectifs next door and the restaurant space always looks a bit crammed so I assume it was mostly outdoors.  We were seated in an indoor patio area which has been converted into part of the indoor dining space with natural lighting seeping through the glass ceiling, perfect setting for sunday brunch!  I was delighted to find out that it's a middle eastern themed menu - definitely a welcoming change from the typical steak/eggs benedict) aplenty across the island.  It also reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants Ottolenghi in London.  The first thing that caught my eye on the brunch menu was the Cauliflower Sabbich, essentially a pita bread open sandwich topped with grilled/deep fried cauliflower, hummus, labneh and served with a smoked egg that resembles funnily enough a Chinese ""tea leaves smoked egg"". It's flavorful without being over seasoned, healthy but filling.  We also had the lamb shashouka, which is basically your normal shashouka with shreds of lamb in it.  Again, won't be complete without scooping chunks of it up with pieces of pita bread.   The lemonade was a bit too sweet but otherwise a refreshing cooler in the heat of the Singapore afternoon.  Can't wait to check out their dinner options.  And if you are visiting the afternoon, do drop by at the Objectifs next door, they always have interesting exhibitions and will be a good place to stroll around and burn off some of that food."

Brunch:-Lamb Shakshouka was amazing. Not at all a healthy choice, but very very good (and it wouldn't be a stretch to say all my friends had serious food envy as soon as the dish arrived).-Mezza platter looked good - your standard mezza platter.-Scrambled eggs looked pretty good as well...but with all the bacon / pork belly on the side the plate was very very greasy / oily and it was rather off-putting for me.. Though I'm sure for some the generous portion of bacon would be a plus!-Our ""appetizers"" of haloumi and hummus didn't come until after all of our entrees, but aside from the poor timing they were enjoyable.-Friend had the banana muffin from the dessert window and thoroughly enjoyed it.-When we arrived without a reservation at 11am on Sunday I was told it would be a 1+ hour wait, and that reservations are usually full for brunch by the Wednesday before the weekend. Luckily we were seated after waiting only about 15 minutes, but I would recommend making a rez if you can plan that far in advance!Dinner:After a delicious brunch at Artichoke my friends and I were excited to come back for dinner and to try the desserts. Unfortunately we were rather underwhelmed by the dinner options. -The dinner menu consisted of a number of dished which I would refer to as ""dips"" or ""sides"" - but not actual dinners. Granted there are a couple full dinner options - maybe 4? Mostly hearty-sounding meat dishes. But there was a serious lack of selection in my opinion. What about my vegetarian friends? Hummus for dinner? There wasn't even a salad on the menu!-My friend and I ordered hummus, the red pepper dip and the grilled cauliflower (the latter it appears was forgotten about as it never came). The two dips, a few drinks, and dessert were enough to fill us up. -Hummus was good - we ordered it again after enjoying it at brunch.-Red pepper dip was weird. It was topped with pomegranate seeds (which were not listed on the menu as part of the dish) and they were really overpowering. Made the dip too sweet, in my opinion.-I had sticky date pudding for dessert. Not what I was expecting - the pudding was topped with what I can only describe as date-flavored jello. I scraped these off and focused on the cake-y part of the dish, and the vanilla sauce.  This was good, but the jello-like topping was weird and I did not enjoy it. -We arrived around 8:45 on Friday evening and were told (despite the more-than-half-empty status of the restaurant) that they were fully booked. Luckily the nice folks at Artichoke were willing to serve my friend and I drinks at one of the side tables (meant to be just for waiting, but not technically part of the restaurant), and then they were able to give us a table for dinner after about 15-20 minutes.Note:-Not sure about the reservation system as when I walked in the wait times I was quoted ended up being rather exaggerated. If you can make a reservation I would suggest it, but if you forgot I would say try your luck walking in.-Dips do not come with bread, you have to pay extra to have something to ""dip"" in your hummus/etc-Service is slow, but always very nice and friendly.-You get a tiny packet of gummy candies as a ""goodbye"" when you leave. So sweet! And yum!"

So far, we've had all three desserts - cookie pie, sticky date pudding, and that milk pudding with rose and strawberry thing that tastes just like bandung. My favorite so far has got to be the sticky date. Coffee wise, the iced mocha is waaaaay too sweet. And why are they charging 50cents more just for it to be iced?Like I said, don't get me wrong. I really enjoy my Artichoke visits. And I love the snarky website. And how the chairs are so thoughtfully placed - three white, one black. Three white, one black. Then three black, one white.

I loved it's convenient location in the city, and near the Bras Basah MRT, yet it is somehow quietly tucked away in a corner complete with a lovely cobblestoned courtyard, bamboo plants and dim lighting.The service there is excellent - the staff are attentive and a chatty manager checked in on my table to see if you are enjoying the food. He was also helpful in recommending dishes and wines or drinks that go with the food. This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore for Moorish food. The dinners here are more social as we all ordered dishes to share, rather than a main each. Expect very different flavours from what you are used to. The lamb here is incredibly tender, and does not have a strong gamey smell or taste. Even people who do not usually eat lamb found it very good here!My favourite exotic dish was the Forgotten Grain Salad - finally something healthy that isn't all green and tastes great! The slow roasted pork belly had incredibly crispy crackling and the meat melted in my mouth. We also ordered the organic mushrooms that had been grown on a local farm. Artichoke currently has a project to grow their own herbs and vegetables - which I think is just incredible!The desserts there are made by them as well, and I have to say, they really take the cake. The salted caramel sticky date pudding was my absolute favourite. It came in a generous portion as well. We also had the basil cheescake with fresh watermelon balls... and the flavours were divine. I could not believe how great the combination was!We really enjoyed all the amazing dishes, and I'm looking forward to trying their brunch menu soon!

And what better way to recover from a hangover than sangria at 11am?It was with this thought in mind that I made my way to Artichoke Cafe & Bar on a Tuesday for some breakfast and good company.With no reservation, we were forced to sit outside, although we were lucky that it was a relatively cool day in Singapore. Tucked away in the courtyard behind two buildings, we were suddenly transported away from present-day Singapore to colonial Singapore. The wicker chairs, the red-painted outer wall of the cafe, the white-paneled windows and doors... the place had its charms, no doubt. But would it live up to its potential?Artichoke's brunch menu is relatively simple, although I could see the ingredients were high quality and a lot of thought had been put into piecing together the items on the menu. The quality menu was lost on its servers though, who were clueless as to what the menu contained, what the ingredients were, and what they themselves were doing there. Needless to say, service was slow and confusing, but it was hard to be mad at the servers who were so utterly clueless. It would be like scolding newborns!I started off with a sangria to put me in the mood for a slow day. Instead, I was jolted awake by how absolutely awful the sangria tasted. It seemed like their idea of sangria was citrus soda with white wine. A place like this couldn't afford to cut up some real fruits for a sangria? Sangria is such a straight-forward drink, how could they screw that up? I wasn't feeling the love. What they gave me was barely drinkable, so I let it sit and watched the condensation slide down the glass as we waited for our food.I opted for the scrambled eggs and bacon chop, which turned out to be a good decision. The maple-glazed bacon chop was thick and meaty, with just enough fat to be tender and fragrant. The scrambled eggs were on the runny side, purposefully so.I also tried my friend's hash browns, which were crisp and delicious (and oily, as hash browns go). Originally, I asked for ketchup to go with the eggs and hash browns, but they said the kitchen didn't have any. A brunch place that does not have any ketchup? Just as I was working myself into a huff, I asked if they had maple syrup and, lo and behold, they did! The tension was quickly diffused as I embraced my Canadianism and poured a generous portion of maple syrup over everything on my plate.While the food turned out to be good, the service was in a constant state of hopeless confusion, and the sangria was an unmistakable failure. I would probably not return unless a friend of mine decided to host a meal here, and even then it would only be for the ambiance."

And artichoke has always satisfied and put me into a medi- mood for weeks after I dine there. They did it again with their awesome mezzes on the menu for just $7/dish $20/ 3dishes . I have my Turkish haunts when I have that itch for endless eggplants, but talking about true comfort meeting epicurean, try this 'middle eatery/ modern eastern' establishment. Great food prep, principles, and ethical food business and practices I very proudly would pay to dine. Simply, they deserve it. So back to mezzes, I personally am head over heels over the babaganoush and the tarama. Bjorn, owner/chef, nailed the eggplant's savouriness with the smoky tender silky mouthfeel all in the babaganoush. The tarama-ish dip is not some caviar, but its pale creaminess that gives that slight fishy, (or as I would like to perceive as the goodness of the sea) is from smoked oyster! Honestly, balancing all those big flavours, with the right mouthfeel nailed it. I shamelessly used my finger and wiped the plate as I was speaking to some people I've just met for the first time of my life. Soooooooooo, I guess, Artichoke won?"

The food here is fresh and full of garlicky, olive-oil goodness. When we asked the waiter about the type of cuisine here, he stated that it consists of ""Syrian, Lebanese, Greek"" influences.  Basically, it is a Mediterranean medley and it is common for your table to share a few dishes.  Appetizers - The mezzo - fresh hummus, red pepper dip, pickled octopus, anchovies - are all fresh and very tasty here.Entrees - I've only eaten here for dinner and have also taken part in ""lambgasm"" (a 2.2 kg feast of lamb with sides).  While the lamb and beef are cooked well, I really like the vegetarian options here as well. The cauliflower and broccoli dishes are both caramelized to perfection and topped with some type of garlic/anchovy sauce.  It is salty, tangy, and completely delicious.Dessert - Mmm, sticky date pudding.  I haven't had any of the ""underdoughs"" desserts but the baklava and tarts at least look great!The inability to split bills is a little odd as was a call to alter a reservation once (it took 2 minutes for the waitress to understand I had an existing reservation and just wanted to move the time).  But the small packet of gummy worms at the end of every meal put me in a better mood."

However the food was good (I wouldn't go so far as 'great') with plenty of choices and attentive service. A cafe cum restaurant with a tapas-mediterranean-meze-fusion style menu... I think Artichoke is having a bit of an identity crisis as I'm not sure what sort of brand it's going for (if it's going for one at all) I would suggest coming here with a group of friends. We ordered everything from salads, to breads, to meats to poultry, to dessert. I especially the flat breads and the quinoa rice salad. The mushies were also delish. Apparently the menu changes regularly and the owner/chef travels abroad once a year to get inspiration as well as contribute to the local community of wherever they are visiting. Along with 2-3 drinks each, we spent approx $75 pp. I don't remember any music playing while we were there... so I'd recommend some background sounds to add some ambience. The small paper bag of candy given to us on the way out was a nice treat. I'd be interested to see how brunch is... there's alfresco dining in the courtyard which is appealing. But in the meantime, a good spot for evening imbibing with friends."

Park along Waterloo Street or Fortune Centre.We had:1) Slow-Roasted Lamb Shoulder ($38): sumptuous and hearty and rich but balanced, with meat so soft it practically fell off the bone. One of the very best lamb I've ever had in my life.2) Smoked Chicken ($30): succulent and perfumed with a heady char3) Greenland Halibut Fish Fingers ($28): loved the pairing with velvety squid ink tartare sauce4) Duck Adana Kebab Tacos ($18 per pair): may not have received the same amount of love as the preceding dishes, but I liked it well enough. It was texturally meaty, and its intense potency was countered by crisp apple strips, shaved radish, a drizzling of lively garlic chive oil and creamy avocado hummus. 5) Charred Broccoli ($16) strewn with a piquant hodgepodge of miso vinaigrette, crumbed feta, pickled garlic, pickled shimeiji and mint.

An outdoor patio (covered, thank goodness) as well as seating indoors. I was there just before opening but the staff were very pleasant, giving me a menu to look at while they busied themselves getting ready. Once inside and seated at the bar (I was by myself, so that seemed the best option - also I didn't have a reservation and they were clearly going to be busy that night) I met the manager, Ronnie, and was immediately charmed. The beer was frosty and cold (-1 C, according to the fridge), and the music was excellent; very edgy but not off-putting or too loud. I ordered the ""chef's menu"" and was blown away. Everything was excellent, from the starters to the main courses to the dessert. Presentation was artful but not fussy. Loved the range of flavours, the wood-smoked beef was a particular hit (they have a wood fire oven in the kitchen). It is definitely on my list of places to return to."

Though it's slightly on the pricey side, the portion was huge and we actually shared 2 main dishes among 4 girlies. We ordered the Duck and the Chicken. Though the duck was more moist in texture, the flavour was not as great as the Chicken. The chicken would have also been more enjoyable if it wasnt as dry. Overall, good taste but a slight mis-match in terms of the texture.The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and generally a nice place to hang out.

In fact it might be my top recommended place for it because of how unique it is. Instead of your usual indie cafe that sells poached eggs drenched in hollandaise sauce and some salads for $18 bucks, Artichoke has more of an Egyptian or middle eastern influences to their cuisine. It shows in their brunch sets too, with the use of feta cheese and hummus etc.My favorite is actually a very simple dish - the scrambled eggs with rocket, feta cheese, and organic mushrooms. Those mushrooms! If this is what organic tastes like I won't mind having all my food be organic. It's really delicious.For the more carnivorous humans, they also have the same combi expect with mushrooms replaced with a bacon chop. When they say bacon chop, don't think of thin strips but a slab of three-layered pork. Very intimidating looking but also delicious and satisfying!Do remember to check the opening times for the place.

The house-made lemonade had a nice kick and freshness to it.I wish I could have the Lamb Shakshouka again - super tender lamb that fell apart easily, surrounded by a rich tomato sauce.If you want some savory brunch dishes (no pancakes or french toast here), this is the place to go!"

The cauliflower was deliciously salted and breaded, and the dressing was tasty.Cuttlefish shawarma, chicken fat dressing, lime ($25) - 3.75 starsThe texture of the cuttlefish was excellent - not too rubbery and grilled just right. But... how is a chicken fat dressing anything less than flavourful?Green harissa prawns, split cream, charred onions ($38) - 4.5 starsThis came with four large prawns cooked right, and a delicious spicy harissa that was wonderful for dipping bread into.Malabi - ruby peach pudding, bergamot ice, white chocolate ($16) - 2.5 starsThe flavours just didn't go well together. The white chocolate on top seemed gimmicky and the bergamot was too sour. I enjoyed the pudding, but it was par for the course.Date pudding, smoked milk, cashew caramel, coffee jelly ($16) - 3 starsThe date pudding was delicious, and so was the crunchy cashew caramel on top. I enjoyed the coffee jelly yes, but it seemed a little out of place.We tried to make a reservation for a Saturday night but they were fully booked so we walked in at 7.30pm and managed to get a table.

The main entrance is directly opposite Fortune Center (the yellow and white building along Middle Road) and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al-fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community. If you're coming from the side door, it is just next to Torte café (the brownie is to die for) at the end of Waterloo Street. I've dined at Artichoke a couple of times (both on weekend brunch and dinner) and always had the best time here. For brunch, you need to come for their Mezza platter (perfect for 2) which consist of 4 mezze (usually babaganoush, hummus, beetroot and smoked salmon) and a few slices of toasted bread. I suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive. One portion is never enough all the time! For dinner last night, we had the usual mezze plates of hummus, babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken, burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share. All the mains were delicious and I wished we ordered second or third of the burrata (I can eat burrata everyday). The deep fried cauliflower was amazing too, the best I've tried in Singapore after Pony Dining in Eagle Strret Pier, Brisbane. Flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture. HEAVEN. The grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender. What makes it so special is the garlic puree (no kissing after eating this, so you have been forewarned) that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it. Do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you're into trying something new. I've heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here. Well, I think it all depends on what you order and how you order. They have their best seller - The ""Lambgasm"" - a 2.8kg bone-in-lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at $220. So of course, if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails, the bill will definitely come up to $300 - $400.  The four of us ordered 4 mezze plates, 3 mains with no drinks and we paid a total of $124 ($28 each) last night. Considering the food we ate, the price was relatively cheap and reasonable. And we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice (not extremely full or bloated) and very satisfied with dinner. It can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner, so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment."

Food was great, a nice change from the typical cafe fare; my only gripe was the cold service. We tried:- Cauliflower Sabbich ($22): I personally enjoyed this, though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted/grilled, and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture. This had a slightly soggy feel to it. The Israeli salad provided some tang, which I liked, and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk - would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though. Overall a tasty dish.- Haloumi & Mushrooms ($22): The best dish of the 3, in my opinion. The toast was thick and fluffy, with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms. The best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast - it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado, haloumi and mushroom all in one bite. - Artichoke Fried Chicken ($24): 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns, which went nicely with the garlic whip. Slightly too greasy for me, and the chicken had a hint of honey. Didn't enjoy the coleslaw, but the chicken was flavorful. We didn't finish this.Good quality and novel food, would return to try their intriguing dinner menu!"

I would describe the decor as Rustic chic, if that makes any sense.., complemented by a full array of old school pop songs to set the vibe. In layman's terms, a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting.The food itself is just tremendous. My wife and I started off with the Pita and hummus. It was spot on. Next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder. Wow, simply wow. The meat just fell off the bone after the first cut, which is a testament to how tender it was. Mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs, this dish easily was the star of the meal.  The other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish. It was very good, but surprisingly sweet. I probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash. Nevertheless, these dishes on their own are just fantastic.We topped the dinner off with Artichoke's Neh Neh Pops. I went for the Mango Sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango. After the first bite, it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller.  Common, how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango. Great food, Great Vibe, Great Company. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes, but of course order that lamb shoulder again."

They are small dishes for 2-4 people.For sides we had the feta burrata, broccoli salad, and the green beans and beet.

We finally ordered the lamb and chicken entrees, as well as the broccoli, brussel sprouts, hummus, egg plant, and beets appetizers to share, with three orders of pita bread. They completed botched our order- three of the dishes were wrong, and when we asked for the correct dishes, it took an additional 45 minutes to get the proper dishes delivered. By that point, everything was cold, and the serving sizes were tiny- definitely not enough to share. So we ended up having to order more.

The décor of this place is quite rustic, and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in New York City where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else.   As for our first experience, we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated (around 2pm). Although I was dying for some fried chicken, the second best thing available on the menu - mushroom scrabbled egg - was just equally delicious. They do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table.Personally I enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch. The menu is bigger - about 10 mezzes and 10 entrees, plus some side dishes. The must haves - pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze, burrata and prawns from the entrée.

We often feel we need our Artichoke fix so we go about once a month. Bjorn does amazing things with food and he doesn't apologize for anything. He constantly tries new flavor combinations and clearly works them out until they are delicious. His cauliflower is something I dream about at night. The fried chicken is out of this world and the prawns are unexplainable you just have to try them for yourself. The ambience is also our favorite because we always feel welcome, comfortable, and relaxed. It's like you are dining in your favorite Uncles house and you don't need to impress anyone.

This is one of those places that makes me think its reviews are all fake. All of the raves of this place must be fake or by people who have no idea what food should taste like. The food here is not ""all that"". Its really not. The reality is that this place has bland food that ""looks and sounds good"". First we ordered the hummus. They say they make it on site. I call BS on that. If they are making it they are doing it wrong. It tastes and looks store bought. Well, not even that good. All they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil. Thats it, its bland, tasteless, and just boring. Next, we had the fried cauliflower, again boring and nothing special. It looks great but has no flavor. After that the fried chicken and beef ribs. They both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through. With the chicken, all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it, the breading, and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce. The ribs were just sweet and tender. None of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat. Finally we had the famous ""sticky date pudding"", this was just taking the piss. Its just watered down peanut butter, with grass jelly, topped with ground up Chinese peanut cakes and sugar. No dates, nothing sticky, and NO flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes. A great example of ""up selling"". They use really cheap ingredients, make it look fancy, and sell it for a ton of money. This last dish made me feel like I was a rube getting fleeced. I bet their food costs are 5%. I wish the food in Singapore was as good as the food in Seoul or Tokyo but its just not. Restaurants like these confirm my opinion. The only good food in Singapore is at Hawker centers. If you go to places like this, its just for atmosphere and not for good food. Its a total waste of money."

Dinner should be fine though.  I was quite surprised by how big the space is inside.  I have passed by several times when I visited Objectifs next door and the restaurant space always looks a bit crammed so I assume it was mostly outdoors.  We were seated in an indoor patio area which has been converted into part of the indoor dining space with natural lighting seeping through the glass ceiling, perfect setting for sunday brunch!  I was delighted to find out that it's a middle eastern themed menu - definitely a welcoming change from the typical steak/eggs benedict) aplenty across the island.  It also reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants Ottolenghi in London.  The first thing that caught my eye on the brunch menu was the Cauliflower Sabbich, essentially a pita bread open sandwich topped with grilled/deep fried cauliflower, hummus, labneh and served with a smoked egg that resembles funnily enough a Chinese ""tea leaves smoked egg"". It's flavorful without being over seasoned, healthy but filling.  We also had the lamb shashouka, which is basically your normal shashouka with shreds of lamb in it.  Again, won't be complete without scooping chunks of it up with pieces of pita bread.   The lemonade was a bit too sweet but otherwise a refreshing cooler in the heat of the Singapore afternoon.  Can't wait to check out their dinner options.  And if you are visiting the afternoon, do drop by at the Objectifs next door, they always have interesting exhibitions and will be a good place to stroll around and burn off some of that food."

Brunch:-Lamb Shakshouka was amazing. Not at all a healthy choice, but very very good (and it wouldn't be a stretch to say all my friends had serious food envy as soon as the dish arrived).-Mezza platter looked good - your standard mezza platter.-Scrambled eggs looked pretty good as well...but with all the bacon / pork belly on the side the plate was very very greasy / oily and it was rather off-putting for me.. Though I'm sure for some the generous portion of bacon would be a plus!-Our ""appetizers"" of haloumi and hummus didn't come until after all of our entrees, but aside from the poor timing they were enjoyable.-Friend had the banana muffin from the dessert window and thoroughly enjoyed it.-When we arrived without a reservation at 11am on Sunday I was told it would be a 1+ hour wait, and that reservations are usually full for brunch by the Wednesday before the weekend. Luckily we were seated after waiting only about 15 minutes, but I would recommend making a rez if you can plan that far in advance!Dinner:After a delicious brunch at Artichoke my friends and I were excited to come back for dinner and to try the desserts. Unfortunately we were rather underwhelmed by the dinner options. -The dinner menu consisted of a number of dished which I would refer to as ""dips"" or ""sides"" - but not actual dinners. Granted there are a couple full dinner options - maybe 4? Mostly hearty-sounding meat dishes. But there was a serious lack of selection in my opinion. What about my vegetarian friends? Hummus for dinner? There wasn't even a salad on the menu!-My friend and I ordered hummus, the red pepper dip and the grilled cauliflower (the latter it appears was forgotten about as it never came). The two dips, a few drinks, and dessert were enough to fill us up. -Hummus was good - we ordered it again after enjoying it at brunch.-Red pepper dip was weird. It was topped with pomegranate seeds (which were not listed on the menu as part of the dish) and they were really overpowering. Made the dip too sweet, in my opinion.-I had sticky date pudding for dessert. Not what I was expecting - the pudding was topped with what I can only describe as date-flavored jello. I scraped these off and focused on the cake-y part of the dish, and the vanilla sauce.  This was good, but the jello-like topping was weird and I did not enjoy it. -We arrived around 8:45 on Friday evening and were told (despite the more-than-half-empty status of the restaurant) that they were fully booked. Luckily the nice folks at Artichoke were willing to serve my friend and I drinks at one of the side tables (meant to be just for waiting, but not technically part of the restaurant), and then they were able to give us a table for dinner after about 15-20 minutes.Note:-Not sure about the reservation system as when I walked in the wait times I was quoted ended up being rather exaggerated. If you can make a reservation I would suggest it, but if you forgot I would say try your luck walking in.-Dips do not come with bread, you have to pay extra to have something to ""dip"" in your hummus/etc-Service is slow, but always very nice and friendly.-You get a tiny packet of gummy candies as a ""goodbye"" when you leave. So sweet! And yum!"

We usually pop in at very strange hours. Like 10pm and zoom in to the dessert menu. So far, we've had all three desserts - cookie pie, sticky date pudding, and that milk pudding with rose and strawberry thing that tastes just like bandung. My favorite so far has got to be the sticky date. Coffee wise, the iced mocha is waaaaay too sweet. And why are they charging 50cents more just for it to be iced?Like I said, don't get me wrong. I really enjoy my Artichoke visits. And I love the snarky website. And how the chairs are so thoughtfully placed - three white, one black. Three white, one black. Then three black, one white.

I loved it's convenient location in the city, and near the Bras Basah MRT, yet it is somehow quietly tucked away in a corner complete with a lovely cobblestoned courtyard, bamboo plants and dim lighting.The service there is excellent - the staff are attentive and a chatty manager checked in on my table to see if you are enjoying the food. He was also helpful in recommending dishes and wines or drinks that go with the food. This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore for Moorish food. The dinners here are more social as we all ordered dishes to share, rather than a main each. Expect very different flavours from what you are used to. The lamb here is incredibly tender, and does not have a strong gamey smell or taste. Even people who do not usually eat lamb found it very good here!My favourite exotic dish was the Forgotten Grain Salad - finally something healthy that isn't all green and tastes great! The slow roasted pork belly had incredibly crispy crackling and the meat melted in my mouth. We also ordered the organic mushrooms that had been grown on a local farm. Artichoke currently has a project to grow their own herbs and vegetables - which I think is just incredible!The desserts there are made by them as well, and I have to say, they really take the cake. The salted caramel sticky date pudding was my absolute favourite. It came in a generous portion as well. We also had the basil cheescake with fresh watermelon balls... and the flavours were divine. I could not believe how great the combination was!We really enjoyed all the amazing dishes, and I'm looking forward to trying their brunch menu soon! Their menu does change fairly often, so drop in and try those delectable dishes before they're off the menu!"

And what better way to recover from a hangover than sangria at 11am?It was with this thought in mind that I made my way to Artichoke Cafe & Bar on a Tuesday for some breakfast and good company.With no reservation, we were forced to sit outside, although we were lucky that it was a relatively cool day in Singapore. Tucked away in the courtyard behind two buildings, we were suddenly transported away from present-day Singapore to colonial Singapore. The wicker chairs, the red-painted outer wall of the cafe, the white-paneled windows and doors... the place had its charms, no doubt. But would it live up to its potential?Artichoke's brunch menu is relatively simple, although I could see the ingredients were high quality and a lot of thought had been put into piecing together the items on the menu. The quality menu was lost on its servers though, who were clueless as to what the menu contained, what the ingredients were, and what they themselves were doing there. Needless to say, service was slow and confusing, but it was hard to be mad at the servers who were so utterly clueless. It would be like scolding newborns!I started off with a sangria to put me in the mood for a slow day. Instead, I was jolted awake by how absolutely awful the sangria tasted. It seemed like their idea of sangria was citrus soda with white wine. A place like this couldn't afford to cut up some real fruits for a sangria? Sangria is such a straight-forward drink, how could they screw that up? I wasn't feeling the love. What they gave me was barely drinkable, so I let it sit and watched the condensation slide down the glass as we waited for our food.I opted for the scrambled eggs and bacon chop, which turned out to be a good decision. The maple-glazed bacon chop was thick and meaty, with just enough fat to be tender and fragrant. The scrambled eggs were on the runny side, purposefully so.I also tried my friend's hash browns, which were crisp and delicious (and oily, as hash browns go). Originally, I asked for ketchup to go with the eggs and hash browns, but they said the kitchen didn't have any. A brunch place that does not have any ketchup? Just as I was working myself into a huff, I asked if they had maple syrup and, lo and behold, they did! The tension was quickly diffused as I embraced my Canadianism and poured a generous portion of maple syrup over everything on my plate.While the food turned out to be good, the service was in a constant state of hopeless confusion, and the sangria was an unmistakable failure. I would probably not return unless a friend of mine decided to host a meal here, and even then it would only be for the ambiance."

I held back because I know the menu I had relished isn't quite the same and reviewing it before I went back for its main stays right now would be a waste of time to read. Well, since I have been teased aptly on this day for being the first ROTD (due to technical glitches previously that rigged this honour for me) here's my review of Artichoke that comes highly recommended.I am a middle eastern somewhere in my gut/belly. And artichoke has always satisfied and put me into a medi- mood for weeks after I dine there. They did it again with their awesome mezzes on the menu for just $7/dish $20/ 3dishes . I have my Turkish haunts when I have that itch for endless eggplants, but talking about true comfort meeting epicurean, try this 'middle eatery/ modern eastern' establishment. Great food prep, principles, and ethical food business and practices I very proudly would pay to dine. Simply, they deserve it. So back to mezzes, I personally am head over heels over the babaganoush and the tarama. Bjorn, owner/chef, nailed the eggplant's savouriness with the smoky tender silky mouthfeel all in the babaganoush. The tarama-ish dip is not some caviar, but its pale creaminess that gives that slight fishy, (or as I would like to perceive as the goodness of the sea) is from smoked oyster! Honestly, balancing all those big flavours, with the right mouthfeel nailed it. I shamelessly used my finger and wiped the plate as I was speaking to some people I've just met for the first time of my life. Soooooooooo, I guess, Artichoke won?"

The food here is fresh and full of garlicky, olive-oil goodness. When we asked the waiter about the type of cuisine here, he stated that it consists of ""Syrian, Lebanese, Greek"" influences.  Basically, it is a Mediterranean medley and it is common for your table to share a few dishes.  Appetizers - The mezzo - fresh hummus, red pepper dip, pickled octopus, anchovies - are all fresh and very tasty here.Entrees - I've only eaten here for dinner and have also taken part in ""lambgasm"" (a 2.2 kg feast of lamb with sides).  While the lamb and beef are cooked well, I really like the vegetarian options here as well. The cauliflower and broccoli dishes are both caramelized to perfection and topped with some type of garlic/anchovy sauce.  It is salty, tangy, and completely delicious.Dessert - Mmm, sticky date pudding.  I haven't had any of the ""underdoughs"" desserts but the baklava and tarts at least look great!The inability to split bills is a little odd as was a call to alter a reservation once (it took 2 minutes for the waitress to understand I had an existing reservation and just wanted to move the time).  But the small packet of gummy worms at the end of every meal put me in a better mood."

I think Artichoke is having a bit of an identity crisis as I'm not sure what sort of brand it's going for (if it's going for one at all) I would suggest coming here with a group of friends. We ordered everything from salads, to breads, to meats to poultry, to dessert. I especially the flat breads and the quinoa rice salad. The mushies were also delish. Apparently the menu changes regularly and the owner/chef travels abroad once a year to get inspiration as well as contribute to the local community of wherever they are visiting. Along with 2-3 drinks each, we spent approx $75 pp. I don't remember any music playing while we were there... so I'd recommend some background sounds to add some ambience. The small paper bag of candy given to us on the way out was a nice treat. I'd be interested to see how brunch is... there's alfresco dining in the courtyard which is appealing.

For sure Artichoke's going down as one of 2016's bests eats.PSA: For first-timers to Artichoke, it's at the junction of Waterloo Street and Middle Road; the little restaurant is tucked away in a nook behind this bright yellow heritage chalet-looking building, opposite Fortune Centre and next to the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (""SCWO"") along Waterloo Street. Park along Waterloo Street or Fortune Centre.We had:1) Slow-Roasted Lamb Shoulder ($38): sumptuous and hearty and rich but balanced, with meat so soft it practically fell off the bone. One of the very best lamb I've ever had in my life.2) Smoked Chicken ($30): succulent and perfumed with a heady char3) Greenland Halibut Fish Fingers ($28): loved the pairing with velvety squid ink tartare sauce4) Duck Adana Kebab Tacos ($18 per pair): may not have received the same amount of love as the preceding dishes, but I liked it well enough. It was texturally meaty, and its intense potency was countered by crisp apple strips, shaved radish, a drizzling of lively garlic chive oil and creamy avocado hummus. 5) Charred Broccoli ($16) strewn with a piquant hodgepodge of miso vinaigrette, crumbed feta, pickled garlic, pickled shimeiji and mint. So good we ordered seconds"

It is in a very nice location on Waterloo Road, not far from the MRT. You walk in off the street and right away you get the sense that this place is a little bit different. An outdoor patio (covered, thank goodness) as well as seating indoors. I was there just before opening but the staff were very pleasant, giving me a menu to look at while they busied themselves getting ready. Once inside and seated at the bar (I was by myself, so that seemed the best option - also I didn't have a reservation and they were clearly going to be busy that night) I met the manager, Ronnie, and was immediately charmed. The beer was frosty and cold (-1 C, according to the fridge), and the music was excellent; very edgy but not off-putting or too loud. I ordered the ""chef's menu"" and was blown away. Everything was excellent, from the starters to the main courses to the dessert. Presentation was artful but not fussy. Loved the range of flavours, the wood-smoked beef was a particular hit (they have a wood fire oven in the kitchen). It is definitely on my list of places to return to."

Though it's slightly on the pricey side, the portion was huge and we actually shared 2 main dishes among 4 girlies. We ordered the Duck and the Chicken. Though the duck was more moist in texture, the flavour was not as great as the Chicken. The chicken would have also been more enjoyable if it wasnt as dry. Overall, good taste but a slight mis-match in terms of the texture.The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and generally a nice place to hang out.

The scrambled eggs at Artichoke are one of the best I have had anywhere, with a creamy smooth yet fluffy texture and seasoned to perfection. They go immensely well with the Roasted Corn and Cherry Tomatoes and complemented the sweet yet savoury Maple-glazed Bacon Chop which is a popular order given that unlike normal, paper-thin bacon, the one served at Artichoke is about 2 cm thick and incredibly sinful-good. Za'atar bread however was overly hard and difficult to enjoy. As good as the scrambled eggs were, the Lamb Shakshouka ($25++) stole the show. Consisting of Eggs in a Skillet w Tomato Sauce, Roast Lamb Shoulder, Kashkaval Cheese, Pistachio Dukka & Za'atar Bread, the Mediterranean brunch item is a refreshing change from the usual eggs and bacon and I am utterly sold by the savoury, mildly spicy dish.

In fact it might be my top recommended place for it because of how unique it is. Instead of your usual indie cafe that sells poached eggs drenched in hollandaise sauce and some salads for $18 bucks, Artichoke has more of an Egyptian or middle eastern influences to their cuisine. It shows in their brunch sets too, with the use of feta cheese and hummus etc.My favorite is actually a very simple dish - the scrambled eggs with rocket, feta cheese, and organic mushrooms. Those mushrooms! If this is what organic tastes like I won't mind having all my food be organic. It's really delicious.For the more carnivorous humans, they also have the same combi expect with mushrooms replaced with a bacon chop. When they say bacon chop, don't think of thin strips but a slab of three-layered pork. Very intimidating looking but also delicious and satisfying!Do remember to check the opening times for the place. It fills up really fast so be sure to make an reservation at least 3 days in advance."

Mock Unagi tasted as though they were the actual with sweet black sauce lying on top of the little rice rice with cucumbers and avocados.Unagi Maki - $15Even at a closer look, they look as good as those in the real Japanese Restaurant.Dishes were getting more interesting in this case with 3 kinds of Sashimi, mock tuna, salmon and sword fish. The presentation and food art was stunning, how did they make the ""veins"" on the fish look so real? Arrangement of food with wasabi on the bed of ice made no different as what we have someone where!Three Kind Sashimi - $19Texture was smooth and these mocked sashimi did give fellow vegetarians a very good indication of how actual sashimi taste like, lessing the natural ""fishy"" taste.The crispy and uniform cuts of the piece of deep fried meat looks none other than a slab of delicious Pork Tonkatsu pairing up with garden salad and its dressing. The texture and bite may resemble an actual pork fillet but the taste still could not hide the fact that its a piece of vegetarian product with hints of mushrooms and yam.Pork Fillet - $11Buckwheat Noodle with toufu skin and mushroom broth is delighting. Beside the smooth buckwheat noodle, fried tempura bits had given the dishes another level of texture in the dish.Buckwheat NoodleLast but not least, the grains! Fried Rice was unexpectedly scrumptious and every mouth came with a whiff of wok fire taste! Incredible! Grains were topped with brown sea vegetables (hijiki) and these vegetables are part of Japanese diet for centuries as they are rich in dietary fibre and minerals such as calcium, iron and magnesium. Who says only red meats give iron?Hjiki Fried Rice - $9Special thanks to my pal who insisted that I should give Teng Bespoke a try and it gave me another view point of having Japanese dining in a vegetarian way. One of the servers did mentioned that they have more than 1 overflow room and in fact Teng Bespoke is also serving Thai Vegetarian Food and perhaps this is why we see Lemon Grass Drink available in its menu."

I really wanted to try the green tea or the udon noodle bowl, but since the bowls were massive, I decided to stick with sushi. I ordered the unagi rolls which were awesome. By the time the salmon rolls came along, I was pretty full. But I managed to polish that off as well. I had the mango juice - which was not that great. The service is somewhat slow so be prepared to wait between orders. I also noticed that they tack on a 10% service charge in addition to the Vat.

For first timers, remember that this place is on the ground floor inside the Sunshine Plaza. The main dining area is a bit tight with seating fairly close to one another. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table as it was a busy weekend. Best to call ahead for reservations.And if you're vegetarian, there is also a Thai vegetarian restaurant called Pepper Jade right around the corner in the same plaza.

At the restaurant itself, you will find no such fanfare of a long name - just a single symbol denoting Teng.We landed here on a rainy afternoon to find a packed restaurant. After waiting for a bit, we were served our menus. I like the fact that they have picture menus with item numbers. Yay for ordering simplicity! But boo for charging 50c for hot water! I instead ordered the $2.50 green tea.Among our appetizers, we much enjoyed the mushroom salad - though I was expecting the dressing to be a bit tangier. The lotus root tempura was underwhelming. Too much batter, too little flavour. For our main course, we tried the Unagi roll and the Kaki Ramen. Both were hearty and flavourful, and dare I say that we licked out plates clean! The Kaki ramen noodles were a bit thick but the sesame flavour worked well. I'm not one to comment on how authentic the Unagi was, but it was delicious for sure, sirree.In terms of service, it was pretty friendly though they did make us wait for a while. When I asked if they were open to customizing their dishes with less oil (for a friend with a dietary restriction) they were quite happy to oblige.Overall I think it is a great addition to the vegetarian dining scene in Singapore."

This is not hyperbole or an exaggeration, because of how passionately Singaporeans feel about chicken rice and specifically about the chicken rice at their favorite stall. I like what this place does for Chicken Rice enough to risk life and limb by saying that it's easily in the top three chicken rice choices in Singapore. The only caveat is that portions have gotten smaller over the years, but I respect the fact that they continue to keep the quality high. If you're in the neighborhood especially having a beer at the American tap room, then you could do worse than dropping by here to have Chicken Rice, especially if visiting Singapore for the first time. You won't be disappointed, the chicken is flavorful and juicy especially if you're having thigh or the drumstick.  I personally gravitate towards breast but it's just because I'm a lazy eater. But at Leong Yeow you don't ever need to compromise because you can ask for deboning.  The chili sauce definitely flies the standard for Chicken Rice high here and it's a little on the spicier side so beware. All in all there are many good reasons why Leong Yeow is one of my favorite go to places for Chicken Rice in Singapore."

My own personal finiky point is - that if you don't eat meat, you don't need to still call it chicken/salmon/beef whatever, us vegetarians are eating it for a vegetable. Anyhow, it certainly fooled my omniverous partner into eating a fully vegetarian dinner, and for that I salute you. It was an awesome way to finish our trip in Singapore and one of the most memorable meals we have ever eaten, if not for my panicked reaction of - wait, did I order duck? No, it's vegetarian duck.

From the owners of stranger Union is curious palette! Opened in 2015, this interesting and rustic looking cafe can accommodate huge groups of diners in its two storey shop house cafe!Looking at the menu, they offer soft shell crab burger, chicken, western fares as well as interesting sounding buttermilk waffles and hot cakes that have taken over Instagram!! They also have a wide selection of cakes. All very vibrantly colored to emphasize the flavours!! The range from $8 and up!1. Matcha Azuki Cake $8.50++I'm a green tea lover and this cake was calling my name. Although, I did feel that this cake was too articially coloured. The green was too vibrant for my eyes. Nonetheless, I dug in and disappointingly, I couldn't really taste the green tea but the azuki (red beans) sweet and pretty much ended up causing the cake to taste like a red bean cake. I didn't even bother to finish up this cake. Skip this cake and get the earl grey lavender manjari cake instead, save your $10.2. Nachos Con Carne $12.90++ *Highly Recommended*With slow-cooked hand-pulled pork, sour cream, jalapeno and melted cheddar. I really liked the pulled pork here, it was well seasoned, tender and also extremely flavourful. The salsa here was abit too sour for my liking. This dish could've used a bit more cheddar, there really wasn't enough cheddar, more than 3/4 of the nachos didn't have cheese on it. Probably one of the most underated dish at Curious Palette, as I hardly saw anyone ordering it! Do try it! You will like it! Truffle fries are overated anyways! Have some meat with your carb!3. Cafe Mocha $5.50++ A nice cup of mocha to perk me up during my later afternoon at Curious Palette. A good balance of chocolate and coffee. This fared alot better than the iced mocha, which literally was too diluted before the ice even began to melt.4. Iced Mocha $6.90++A very typical iced mocha, nothing fancy. It had chocolate powder on top of it. It tasted kinda of diluted, not a very strong chocolate, milk or coffee taste. I was kind of disappointed in this drink, considering the price that you pay and the fact they they had easily 4 staff behind the coffee counter. 5. Earl Grey Lavender Manjari Cake $8++ *Highly Recommended*This was the first cake that caught my eye in the cake display. It had a slight blue-ish purple colouring on the top. There were several layers to the cake, which the staff described as ""chocolate layers"" And indeed they were. They were chocolate ganache layers that had a lavender aroma and taste! The fragrance of the lavender was subtle but yet enough for me to pick it up! The cake was on the slightly dryer side, wasn't as moist as I had hoped it to be. But everyone on the table agreed, it was one of the most interesting cake we had ever come across!6. Pina Colada Tea $7.50This was a very interesting tea, as it tasted very fruity and even without sugar, there was a hint of sweetness. The sweet aroma itself, made me wonder about what ingredients were used to make this tea! Served in a tea pot, it's a pretty tea set that comes with this order.7. Berry Ricotta Hotcake $12.90++ *Highly Recommended*With vanilla bean ice cream, fresh seasonal berries, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seed. These are breakfast pancakes summer-style, ridiculously light, and lemony somehow! They are crispy like a biscuit on the edges and super soft and fluffy on the inside. Almost like eating a freshly baked moist cupcake!If you imagine the flavour of cheesecake combined with a texture that's best, if wordily, described as a kind of souffled griddle cake, you're somewhere near getting the measure of these.In my view, this is their fabulous delicacy and, besides, there is some accompanying fruit allows you to delude yourself that these are healthy.8. Spam Fries $11.90++These spam fries served with Kaffir lime mayo, which tasted like plain mayo. No lime fragrant or taste was evident. The spam fries though were slightly softer and tender in texture in comparison to other spam fries I've tried. The edgers weren't crispy though, they were just hard.Overall : It's quite expensive considering you have to pay 7% GST and 10% service charge. It can get quiet full, so do call and make a reservation. The food isn't all that great. Although I didn't try any mains, I did see alot of people order the soft shell crab at $22++. I would only come here for the Earl Grey Lavender Manjari cake or the Hotcakes."

The only deviation from the hipster template comes in the form of the thumping club techno that's loud enough to make you speak just a bit louder than you'd normally do in a café. The place is definitely well decorated, and the lighting and layout seems almost deliberately set up for patrons to take instagram-worthy photos of their very photogenic food. Popped by for a coffee, so can't say much about the food. Friends had several variations of milky coffee, and I had a Kalita'd Finca Santa Teresa. The drip coffee was well executed, and highlighted all the rich, chocolatey, berry notes of the coffee. Craft beer menu looks decent as well - Brewdog Dead Pony Club and Green Goblin on draught, and a slew of very drinkable craft bottles. Would pop by again if I'm in the area. Despite the hipster trappings, seems like a place I'd enjoy returning to. Now if only they'd turn the damn music down a notch or two..."

Located at a row of shop houses, this restaurant is easily recognised without a signboard. We were there with our goggle map showing us that we were at the right spot, but looking around, we saw signboards of others except for this one and when we went closer for a look, we saw the signboard in small blackboard on a chair. I am not too sure whether I am impressed with this idea. Stepping inside, I saw many paintings of Asian arts on the walls and it was pretty crowded. We had to wait for a while before our table was ready. As hungry as a bear I ordered the $22 plus Chicken leg, why so expensive? I was curious to find out. My friend's meal came quite fast while mine seemed to take forever to come (15 minutes later in fact) and my jaws almost dropped when I saw the portion of it. It was ok on the whole especially with the rice - I thought it was not bad. However, I wasn't full at that point as the portion to be honest has a lot to be desired. The service on the other hand was average, neither bad or good, guess there weren't enough staff around, but at least we didn't wait long for the bill. Well, I would come back to give it another go to try other dishes."

Service, while not particularly prompt, is polite and attentive.Salmon was well-executed, moist, flavorful and complete with a crispy skin. The guacamole and haloumi were definitely a nice touch, though the bacon scone was a slightly bizarre addition to the dish. Didn't seem to really jive with the other elements on the plate. For the portion, it is on the pricey side though. Pulled pork sandwich was decent, with an adequately thick slice of bread to hold the mound of pulled pork. Egg was also perfectly poached.Truffle fries were awesome and special mention to the truffle aioli. They do, however, charge for topping up the aioli.The lavender manjari was great as a chocolate cake, and while photogenic, the lavender taste was imperceptible.

From the discreet sign outside the restaurant that scribbles ""Curious Palette"" in such a unreadable cursive font, to the ondeh ondeh inspired cake and of course chai tea latte, it's hipster stamped all over it. (Context as to why I used chai tea latte as a hipster barometer. Having recently been to Melbourne that has a super fantastic flare of hipster cafes, for a non-coffee drinker like me, chai tea latte is like the next best substitute for the inability to enjoy the great coffee brew. If you have chai tea latte in your indie lookig cafe, you are hipster certified. At least, in my opinion. Heh)Don't let the exterior of the cafe fool you as its quite a large cafe that stretches deep into the back. Plenty of seats and a pretty nice ambience. My friend had truffle mushroom soup and it was pretty awesome. Fragrant and thick, it's a pretty dense soup. As it was really late, thats about all we had, including a nice huge slide of ondeh ondeh cake. I still prefer the real ondeh ondeh as the beauty of the kuey is really being able to enjoy the sweet and warm hula Melaka burst in your mouth as you bite into it. That's something a cake cannot replicate. Good effort, but just not the same experience.Will be very happy to try it out again and this time, for the mains and the beautiful pancakes!"

We booked some seats at Curious Palette purely because it had pulled pork sandwiches on the menu and that is enough to get me excited. Eating proper meals at hipster cafes is always a risk because they are probably more adept at making coffees or reselling central kitchen cakes, than cooking proper food. That turned out to be the case but I'm not surprised. First, the good thing about Curious Palette is that the cafe is in a fairly long shop house that stretches to the back. There's quite a few tables and waiters/waitresses running around so you can get decent service. The decor is bright and I could see why people would want to hang out here. I arrived for dinner last and was seated at our table for three at a seat with the back facing the ""walkway"" where servers constantly were passing through. It wasn't a great idea because I felt like I was in everyone's way all the time. I ordered a ""wagyu"" burger, while my friends ordered the chicken confit and fried chicken (yes apparently they like fowl), as well as a bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc (the wine list is extremely limited and obviously curated to meet the $50-70 price point so you either get overpriced pedestrian village (in an attempt to satisfy the old world lovers) and a not so overpriced new world selection, since the latter tends to be cheaper anyway...so we went with the latter). My ""wagyu"" burger was tasty with a heavy dose of truffle derivatives/seasoning on it, but the meat/fat wasn't mind blowing so it made me wonder why bother using a low grade of wagyu just for marketing purposes. At the $20-30 range, this is likely to be Australian ""wagyu"" chuck though I would guess the cow is actually a mix breed, given the lack of fat and real flavor. To use a really poor analogy, its like being promised plate of char kuay teow without the fried lard - tastes fine and you can probably hide the lack of lard with some wok hei, but it's not the same. What annoyed me a little more was the doneness - I asked for my patty to be cooked medium because unlike steaks, ground meat can be quite mushy and grotesque when it is below 140F in the middle, which was the case with my burger. I sent back my burger a second time and was told by the kitchen that anything with a medium doneness will usually err on the bloody side and all I've to say is...get a good broiler or a sous vide machine? I am paying at least an arm for this burger. Anyway the accompanying sweet potato fries were fine, the fried chicken my friend ordered was crispy and juicy and the wine did its job (although our glasses were unbelievably frozen and the waiter clearly wasn't trained to pour wine). So yes, a meh passable experience. Maybe it's just me but does hipster = expensive and nothing except the coffee is supposed to taste great?"

The pourovers were clearly poured properly, for example warming both the cone and the cup with hot water before adding filter and grounds. The space is much smaller than I thought from the photos, and very different from your usual hipster coffee hangout. There is no well labelled merchandise impeccably ordered on minimalist japano-swedish shelves, no pastel colour scheme undermining the brutality of the raw concrete and painted building bowels. Think more Ikea furniture packed with coffee making equipment and a small roaster running at the back. If there was food I did not see it. Four sandwiches are written on a board, and seem to be the only option. Coffee beans on sale (Yirgacheffe, 150g for $18; Blue Mountain for $65) were roasted on the 5th of March, a full week ago, which is the only minor issue I could find, but I know some roasters think coffee peaks 5 days after roasting."

He's roasted batches for some friends who've become regulars (and fast friends, especially since their command of Chinese is leagues better than mine), and the range of beans, coupled with the quality of his roast, makes him quite a rare find.Elsie is usually the face of the business, and does great front-end service, and also makes a mean Taiwan-style iced shaken tea, quite like a bubble tea.

Interestingly, they serve waffles, soups and other desserts too.I had a wrap+chicken+5 toppings and my partner had a single salad consisting of 5 toppings. It cost under $16 and was very fulfiling. This is easily one of the most value for money salad places in Singapore, besides cold storage. Others are incredibly overpriced!The staff recommended me to take an extra meat but I declined so it can make me 'full' as I chose mainly light ingredients.  A constant stream of customers arrived, most likely Kaplan students. Happy Tummy is new to market, and I saw on their Fb that they are opening a new outlet at Yishun! Lucky Yishunittes..Definitely coming back to try!"

This is my all-time favourite salad bar. I probably go there twice a week. Fresh ingredients, friendly peeps and so much cheaper than Salad Stop!A Single, gets you a base of romaine and 5 toppings for $6.80. A Double (which supposedly feeds 2 peeps, but I eat it all by myself. Moo!) gets you a generous base of romaine and 8 toppings, all for $10. They also give unlimited herbs and condiments, like basil, oregeno, parsley, fried shallots, garlic and sesame seeds. I usually get the Roasted Sesame or Miso Sesame dressing. Premium items, like spinach, roast chicken or freshly grilled salmon (made in house), cost anything from $1 to $2.50 more each. Even then, my Doubles never cost more than $13. If I went to Salad Stop, I'd get half the amount for the same price. And for half the smiles too. (Alright, I'll stop knocking Salad Stop!) They also serve wraps, soups, ice-cream waffles, cold pressed juices, coffee/tea and baked goods like macaroons, muffins, tarts. But I'm usually there to eat ""clean"", so I just take in the smells. There is a seating area for about 15-20, but it looks a little crammed, so I usually take out. Probably not good for big groups. If you're a student/staff from SMU, Kaplan, NAFA or Lasalle, you get one free additional topping, and if you are from RSM International, the Ascott Limited or Citadines, you get a special discount. They also have a loyalty card. 4 orders gets you a free topping, 8 gets you a free premium, and 13 gets you a free Single salad. I LOVE HAPPY TUMMY!"

I got stuck in Wilkie by the rain. It was lunchtime so I thought why not. The position of the restaurant is quite nice, having the seating in a corner means a spacious view including on the street (seeing the sky in a mall! who'd have thought), although the tables are very close together and you will bump into people. The burger patty definitely came from the freezer as did the sliced Kraft cheese on top. Salad was alright, although a few of the grapes were very soft. The sesame dressing was great, the chef has taste. The lemonade was enjoyable and did not have the cleaning fluid feel of the artificial stuff you find in food courts.  I just want to point out this is not a hipster salad bar with specially imported ingredients, just Cold Storage/Fairprice stuff thrown together at an attractive price, not a destination, but a good place to hang out if you already live here. Definitely a good option for a traditional breakfast, and I guess I should try the salads people are raving about. All in all, but a welcome addition to Wilkie for those of us who just want a simple healthy lunch without paying $20 at any of the mediocre ""food concepts"" nearby. Together with the arrival of Hao Wei Lai opposite, things are looking up in the not-hipster, not-hawker segment for the neighbourhood."

The steamed chicken rice and spare ribs on rice are good for a meal for modest eaters. I like that they add wolfberries to the chicken for a touch of sweet and colour. The ribs are always tender and cooked just right. The prawn dumpling soup has generously stuffed dumplings livened with shredded black fungus and shrimp, crunchy goodness! And the soup is tasty without giving you an msg attack. The glutinous rice with chicken and sausage in lotus leaf is nicely made, and goes superbly with the chilli sauce. And the chilli sauce is the bomb. Made inhouse, it is larded through generously with superbly crispy garlic chips. Love love love that sauce! If they bottle it I would so buy it. The siew mai and char siew buns are also hearty and rustic which is part of their charm. If you know what to expect, this is a good place to pop by for quick cheap eats."

So in addition to having a truly impressive selection, the American Taproom makes it a point to receive only fresh product, store and handle it properly, all in order to serve you the beer the brewer intended you to have.The kitchen at the American Taproom also puts out some really creditable bar food which is hearty, tasty and provides a solid complement to the tap list."

Although it says on the website that it is a Singaporean lifestyle place, I got the impression that was more of a hodgepodge of Asian food. Dishes varied from chicken curry to braised pork rice bowls. It was a little awkward when I ordered as the guy at the counter barely spoke any English. Apparently, the iced tea that I ordered carried an additional surcharge of $0.50 SGD. The food was pretty good for fast casual food. Basically, everything is pre-made and was slopped onto my plate. Despite the fact that it was pre-made, it was still pretty decent regardless and nicely presented. Note, there was air conditioning in this place but some a**hole left the door open letting that precious cold air out escape out the door."

They do have franchises in other countries. But, they just don't taste as good compared to the ones in Singapore. I have to get their Kopi-C here, which is basically their blend of aromatic coffee with creamy and sweet condensed milk. Better than any Starbucks chain. As for their breakfast options, I really don't go for their sweet options. I have tried most of their savory items. My favorite items to order for a hearty breakfast were their Nasi Lemak, Curry Chicken Rice, and my sister's favorite, their braised pork over rice with a roasted chicken leg on the side. All of these dishes were brimming with flavor and packed a wonderful punch. I appreciated that the rice that came with these dishes was aromatic and not mushy. Other noteworthy dishes that were pretty good were their laksa and mee goreng. The noodles in the laksa were broken up into pieces for easy eating. But, this didn't allow much of that laksa broth flavor to be absorbed. We just prefer their spaghetti type noodles more, as far as flavor and texture goes. The laksa broth was also a little bit too creamy from all the coconut milk, in our opinion. The mee goreng noodles were a bit over cooked when I tried it, and the flavor was a little overpowering for me from that shrimp paste. Definitely, cut that strong flavor with the calamansi provided. The pan fried spam was the star of the show in the mee goreng dish.Overall, Toast Box is just a wonderful and consistent food option in Singapore to eat breakfast or lunch. It would be dangerous to have a Toast Box close to home, since I practically ate Toast Box almost every morning. Not necessarily good for that waistline. Lol. At least I can splurge on my diet while in Singapore. They're practically everywhere in Singapore (like an Asian McDonald's). It's worth mentioning that their savory items are $8 USD or less.

Their specialty is the Mongolian pork rib which is heavenly. The ribs are not cut into small cubes and there are still huge chunks of meat stuck to it. Perhaps it's not favourable for dainty ladies that will be paiseh to hold up the bones and rip the meat off; I have no qualms for that =D  The ribs has a very unique taste; creamy, peppery and there's a hint of mint. The sauce is very appetising and I can finish my whole of rice just with the sauce alone. The rib if always cooked till tender but not too soft till it just falls off the bone. Another house special will be the signature tofu. If I guess it correctly, it's normal tofu smashed with other condiments like onions+ carrot + minced meat, then being re-shaped into a cube and deep fried. Sounds like a perfectly simple dish yet tastes awesome. They are served with some fresh cabbage and mayo on the side. The rib and tofu is my ""must-order"" dishes. Other common zhi char dishes are very good too; sambal kangkong, fu rong egg, pai gu wang. The next time you are around Bugis but looking for a non-shopping-mall-food-chain-place, you should definitely try 3838. Highly recommended!"

Their website lists its menu and includes prices, which is extremely rare - well done.Around 11:40am I went there to get an early start on lunch. Ordered the spicy chicken spaghetti meal ($8.90) which included soup and pasta.The soup of the day was cream of mushroom and it was excellent. Thanks for not making some disgusting SoTD flavours like Subway does e.g. cream of broccoli. It also came with a sliver of garlic bread which was also excellent, but small.Finally after 20 minutes (I'm guessing they lost my order) the main came out (see pic). Overall it was good, the pasta was nice, the chicken and diced tomatoes were excellent, but the rest of the sauce was a bit bland, and not spicy.Additionally, no Parmesan cheese, pepper grinder or Tabasco on the table was a bit weird. But overall for less than $9, a hearty meal."

More value for the same price! But the staffs are sometimes not very attentive. Although there are not many customers around, they took quite a while to come to us to take our orders (sadly, this happened more than once).

The food was delicious. I'm normally a guy who needs meat in his meals, but the wife was craving vegetarian. I ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides. The garlic naan  has visible bits of garlic covering it, but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor. I wouldn't have minded a stronger punch of garlic, but I do love garlic. The mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go. I probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with.The uttapam was a pancake-like food which we ordered the onion version of. It's like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice. The sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one. I personally liked the spicy one. The white one reminded me of a cole slaw. We finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing. Not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which I appreciated.You can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign. Thankfully they also had a sink with soap  to wash your hands since the meals are eaten by hand.Overall really good experience and we would come back again"

We tried everything from the spicy ""Podi Dosa"" to the soft idlies and to the foot tall ""Cone dosa"", which was unsurprisingly, shaped like a cone. They all tasted pretty darn good and consistent. The chutneys could've had a little bit of variation. They all tasted pretty much the same which kind of got old pretty fast. The best part about the meal was the glorious filter coffee.

There's a sink to wash your hands cause that's all you're gonna be using to eat with. Just the atmosphere and everything. Oh man. You've got to try the MANGO LASSI! Most I've had in America have been overly sweet but this. this was on point. Yogurt + Mango and the perfect amount of sweetness. So onto the food. We ordered Butter Naan and regular Naan and split several of the dipping dishes between 5 of us. We ordered 5 dishes and boy they creep up on you. I was so full by the end of the meal. To be honest after a while all of them started to taste similar to me - but I have low spicy tolerance and it was probably more of that speaking. I'm terrible at remembering names but there was this one dish that stood out that was green (I believe spinach / pea mixture). Anyway if you figure out which one that is you should try it :) Big hit with our table."

So definitely  avoid trying to go to the loo here.Food wise, this is a South Indian place so you can't go wrong with Dosa - however if you can't tolerate too much spice like me, just let the servers know because I didn't and my dosa came laden with green chillies! The sambar was truly lovely as was the coconut chutney. Not that big fan of the tomato chutney. Loved that you could get second helpings of the sambar and chutneys as well as the subzi for free. The local folks we were with got an Andhra Plate. I can't recall if this particular item was available only on weekends or just Sunday's but gosh, that plate was turbo loaded with food - no dosa include in this however, unfortunately!Would def return as good food at great price and free second helpings"

I sat downstairs and ordered idlis, a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast. For those who do not know what an idling is, the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake, generally 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and made with fermented batter (like masa for tamales) using a mix of soaked rice and daal (lentils).  Medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour. Upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat, cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves, onions, mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves.By lunch time, I was craving the food at Komala Vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section, climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table. In a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls. Another server came by and filled the utensils with different South Indian vegetarian preparations. I was served rice, papadums, sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork, started attacking what was in front of me.  Never having expected to finish all my rice, I was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping.  It is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough. The stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more.I have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it, often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants, Indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called Singapore.My big frustration is that if Komala Vilas in Singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared South Indian food, why can't other similar restaurants outside India, particularly those in the US do so? Even if some copy Komala Vilas' name they fail to replicate its food. If only the original Komala Vilas decides to expand to the San Francisco Bay Area, life could be so wonderful."

Komala Vila is located in the heart of little India. When you enter the restaurant the staff will seat you downstairs or escort you upstairs depending on capacity. Then you'll wash your hands because you won't find utensils here! The dish that kept both of us coming back was the Masala Dosa. The masala dosa is a crispy crepe rolled up and stuffed with potatoes, peas, and delicious spices. It's paired with three different dipping sauces. I have no idea what they were or what they were called but the yellow one is delicious!! If you're in the mood for something sweet order a mango lassi drink.

The food was delicious. I'm normally a guy who needs meat in his meals, but the wife was craving vegetarian. I ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides. The garlic naan  has visible bits of garlic covering it, but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor. I wouldn't have minded a stronger punch of garlic, but I do love garlic. The mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go. I probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with.The uttapam was a pancake-like food which we ordered the onion version of. It's like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice. The sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one. I personally liked the spicy one. The white one reminded me of a cole slaw. We finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing. Not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which I appreciated.You can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign.

So yes, I was not surprised by anything at Komala Vilas. And apparently it is a pretty old restaurant which used to be good. I'm glad to tell you they are holding up pretty well.The food was overall pretty good. We tried everything from the spicy ""Podi Dosa"" to the soft idlies and to the foot tall ""Cone dosa"", which was unsurprisingly, shaped like a cone. They all tasted pretty darn good and consistent. The chutneys could've had a little bit of variation. They all tasted pretty much the same which kind of got old pretty fast. The best part about the meal was the glorious filter coffee. It was bitter... just so darn bitter and sweet - exactly how South Indian coffee should be. It was a perfect way to wrap this breakfast up. Will drop by again when I'm craving some nostalgia."

I sat downstairs and ordered idlis, a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast. For those who do not know what an idling is, the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake, generally 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and made with fermented batter (like masa for tamales) using a mix of soaked rice and daal (lentils).  Medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour. Upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat, cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves, onions, mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves.By lunch time, I was craving the food at Komala Vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section, climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table. In a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls. Another server came by and filled the utensils with different South Indian vegetarian preparations. I was served rice, papadums, sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork, started attacking what was in front of me.  Never having expected to finish all my rice, I was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping.  It is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough. The stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more.I have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it, often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants, Indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called Singapore.My big frustration is that if Komala Vilas in Singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared South Indian food, why can't other similar restaurants outside India, particularly those in the US do so? Even if some copy Komala Vilas' name they fail to replicate its food. If only the original Komala Vilas decides to expand to the San Francisco Bay Area, life could be so wonderful."

Then you'll wash your hands because you won't find utensils here! The dish that kept both of us coming back was the Masala Dosa. The masala dosa is a crispy crepe rolled up and stuffed with potatoes, peas, and delicious spices. It's paired with three different dipping sauces.

One appeared to be yogurt based, another with chili peppers in it, and then another that was similar to curry. The food itself was barebones delicious, and even at around 4pm the restaurant was packed. There were side boxes for to-go samosas that also looked delicious. The menu is hard to understand if you aren't familiar with authentic Indian cuisine, but everything is so good and the pictures provide a lot. We were in and out quickly even though we ended up sitting down, and is a good place to take a quick meal/snack break while wandering around Little India.

A couple of things - South Indian food is meant to eaten with hands mostly.  They have a wash basin to wash your hands. But it would be great to keep it a bit more cleaner.   Also they take only cash. If you don't have cash, there is an ATM at a store ( a few feet nearby).

I had lunch with my sis and mum today. I ordered an Indian rice meal while the other 2 had dosas. Mine arrived first and both of them took a bite to try the food which was all they did. When I asked for an extra helping of the vegetable curry (which is the norm), I was told due to our sharing my food I was not eligible to get more food. The person attending to me was a manager so I explained that they had ordered their food and were just waiting. He served me the curry without issues. However, when I asked a waiter he absolutely refused to serve me until I raised my voice. I am DISGUSTED and SHOCKED. I have been a loyal customer since I was a child and go to the restaurant at least once a month. I even know some of the servers by face and name.

You get unlimited rice and curry for $7.20.  Yes, they have raised the price a couple bucks since we first came but it's totally worth it.  Everyone in the restaurant is using their hands and speaking in Tamil or other Indian dialects.  We get plenty of strange looks when we show up.

With the flavours & combinations, you can't really go wrong. Had the beef bowl & foie. Like I said with the flavours & quality of ingredients, you can't really go wrong. I was happy with the Foie, big portion, cooked well and packed with flavour. The beef was tasty but when you order it with the foie, they GIVE SO LITTLE!!! Which didn't make sense! Because if I paid more it should be a add-on not a way to balance the portions? The rice was a little dry. The batch I had was not cooked well in my opinion but luckily it had all the other stuff to make it decent. I didn't like the Ginger Lemonade. For the size of the glass (and price!), it should really be done better. It lacked balance and the ginger was so overpowering that I felt like I ordered a spicy ginger drink! I could hardly taste the lemonade. I had to add water & squeeze the lemon wedge to balance the flavour. Menu options sounded good. I'd come back to try the other dishes."

Surprisingly it wasn't all that bad. the carbonara toppoki was not overly creamy nor greasy but i don't recommend it for one person.

Logically it was weird but taste wise, it was perfect! And if you want to know how the pizza is made, do watch the in store video that's playing; every step of the process is explained in detailed.

I'd recommend trying one of the other options nearby.Came here on a Sunday evening, and was seated quite quickly with no wait. However, their ordering system was quite overly complicated. Rather than just simply ordering with one of the wait staff, the ordering experience involved having to sign up on my device for an account and inputting my credit card details online to pay for my food in advance. Not a huge inconvenience, but since I had slow data speeds in the shop, it didn't help my experience.I went for the 12'' Bulgogi Pizza ($28 after fees), which looked quite promising on the menu. It was definitely a bit pricey for a meal for one. After about a 15 minute wait, it finally came out, and much to my dismay, seemed to be so sparse in Bulgogi that I was wondering if I had accidentally ordered the vegetarian option by mistake. Eating it, I was very quickly overpowered with the taste of onion, which was really all it tasted like--the bulgogi had very little flavor. I'd recommend going with some of the other pizzas on their menu, personally.I don't think I'll be coming back here, given that there are plenty of other options that are more affordable in the area, with a more standard and less frustrating service experience."

It's always crowded to the brim (at least on all of my visits) so reservation is recommended.  And no, this is not your upscale, pretty, zen kaiseiki fine dining kind of place, it's more like a hole-in-the-wall establishment. At times, their tables spilled over to the ""roadside"" - the corridor inside the very run-down looking mall.  Understandably, you might be a bit skeptical but the sheer volume of native Japanese seems to be testimonial of its authenticity.  And the moment you sat down, take a sip of the sake and dig into that bowlful of octopus tentacles full of umami goodness you get teleported to the streets of Japan.  Menu seems constantly updated and items come in small plates for sharing.  Just pick whatever looks good or just pick everything, the good thing about small plates is that you can have a good selection.  On my first visit when my friend took me there, he told me about the ""rule"" that to get a seat you need to order alcohol.  Understandably that causes some distress in people who don't drink but to be fair it is an izakaya which is literally a place for drinks so make some alcoholic friends!"

Sometimes the rice feels powdery & a bit dry but that was probably because of the weather. The key to a great Biryani is that the meat & rice needs to be slow cooked in traditional spices for it to be at it's juiciest best. That is exactly how the owner approaches this complicated & subtle dish.This is as authentic as it gets & it's NOT that brown goop they serve with yellow rice at most places which even the owner at Bismillah agrees is an abomination! Biryani was the dish of Mughal emperors & soldiers & signified feasting in a royal manner. It was considered a complete meal in itself & it is with that respect for tradition & flavour that the owner/chef Arif bhai cooks it. It is his love for crafting this complex dish that adds to the old school charm of this place in addition to the brilliant food.

Yes, din tai fung doesn't disappoint. But as I develop taste for Asian food, living in Singapore I get greedy and crave for something beyond. So while on the look out for good dim sum that hasn't been all fancied-up by us expats, came across quite a few posts on this place. Then our office move happened and found myself working only ~10 minutes walk away from here. So it finally happened. Food was great. My Chinese friend approved its authenticity and way above-par taste (and even over-ate -- this is someone who DOES NOT over-eat.) * Egg tarts (4/5) were really good. Very fluffy & light with crisp crust on the outside. *Siew Mai's (3/5) were okay. I definitely had better ones before. Didn't particularly find them flavorful. * Har gao (4/5) -- yes! The shrimp meats were thick & tangy. Enough said. * Spinach & Prawn dumplings(3.5/5) also had good shrimp meat inside & had stickiness and juice that went well together. But would've liked it better if there was a bit less skin of the dumpling. * Chee-chong fun with Charsiew (3.5/5) was decent as well. Now that I think about it, perhaps I don't like the dumpling skin-like things too much in general. * Carrot cake, I can't say much about because I am not a fan to begin with. So will refrain from commenting. * Spicy sauce chicken claws (a.k.a. chicken feet) (4.5/5) was a wow! I've heard many things about how it has lots of collagen and all & tried several times, but one bite was enough for each of those. But this time, it was different. The sauce was just the right spiciness with really delicious flavor. Best chicken feet I've had so far. I will definitely order this again. * Steamed spare ribs with black bean sauce (4.5/5) was another win. Well-steamed to the right level of tanginess, just the right amount of flavor that brings out the taste of the rib, while not being bland. Loved it. * Golden ""Bo Lo"" Char Siew Butter Buns (4/5) were very tasty. Crips on the outside, filled with rich char siew fillings on the inside. But to me, it was a bit too saucy. Still good, but a bit more meat and less sauce would've hit the golden balance. * Double-boiled egg white with fresh milk and almond juice (2.5/5) was okay. Too much almond taste for a double-boiled egg. * Golden Egg Yolk Lava Buns (3.5/5) -- supposedly the most popular dish here -- didn't impress me too much. Expected the inside to be a bit more rich gooey liquid fullness but didn't really happen. The mixture didn't seem to be very well mixed. Still decent.  I will be trying Charsiew Baos and some porridge the next time I go. Service is not bad, but the food doesn't come out too fast either. (Having heard of the long queue, I went pretty early-- a bit before noon -- but the food still came out rather slow and came in a staggered manner, not in any particular oder. Perhaps my personal preference but I like my dimsums to just come all at once for me to gawk at the variety and steaminess all together.) But let's just think that that's how fresh the dimsums are? as they are made to order? The ambiance is not somewhere you'd just walk by and be invited to go in. But I think it's part of the authentic experience. So I loved it and would definitely be bringing my friends here."

I expect you're really expecting some sort of verdict on the famed liushabaos (those salted egg yolk custard lava buns) and those were pretty disappointing. it was very oily, with much of the fat having separated from the paste, and it didn't really ooze (not even with a less-than-gently squeeze). flavor-wise, I think it could have done with a bit more salt.the menu is small, but it's cheap, and it's rather like those eateries you get in old-town malaysia or hong kong.

When i arrived it was just as people commented 'small, tiny place'. Did wait awhile to find a seat and had to call the waitress a few times to get the order chit. Aside from these, the food was not bad. I decided to try the summer milk tea which sounded yummy, indeed it was. However i thought that it was quite expensive $3 for a cup of tea, it was akin to buying a cup of Koi bubble tea with pearls. Next we tried the highly acclaimed items such as the siew mai, custard bun, king prawn dumpling and hong kong style pan fried chee chiong fun (rice roll). The siew mai was really good with actual crab roe on top of it and it was flavourful, juicy and succulent. The custard bun was really smooth and creamy and went well with the texture of the fluffy bun.The dumpling was a giveaway as for that price, the amount of filling given was really worth it. The succulent skin was so thin yet maintained a bouncy and chewy feel and alot of filling was wrapped into that skin, it was as if it was going to burst anytime. Next came the hong kong style chee chiong fun and it was interesting i must say. Have never tried anything like it, crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, yummy. The service there however was not really good, they seemed to favour westerners more than us. Overall a good experience with some misses."

Nothing to shout about, I've had far better dim sum. They forgot our order of the you tiao chang fen or there was some mix-up. It was so busy and chaotic that we didn't bother to ask them.The real highlights of the meal were the drinks. Iced milk tea - hot tea served in a plastic cup in a bowl of ice cubes so the tea isn't diluted when the ice melts. Pretty novel idea and the tea is close to what you get at cha chan ting's in HK.

The steamed carrot cake was pleasantly surprising - bits of scallops and waxed sausage (lup cheong) mixed in an almost coarse pudding - and the XO sauce adds a little extra zing.The rest of the food passes by in a haze, and we harry the auntie for more, but you'll remember to order the Zhar Leong (cheong fun with you tiao), and have some ice summer milk tea - they cool the drink by placing the cup in a bowl of ice, so it gets cooled without being diluted. Old School much.And of course, you'll finish your meal with some Golden Egg Yolk Lava Buns. Everyone does, as long as they still have some in stock. You might call it Liu Sha Bao, but here at Victor's, everything's got a cooler name.A couple of months ago, we heard about a change in the family situation, and the food quality may have changed, but subsequent visits don't show noticeable differences. Give it a go, it don't cost much any way."

It is a really narrow shop though, so be prepared to sit a little too close for comfort next to a stranger from the next table. To order, you tick your selected dishes on an order slip and hand in to a waitress. The waitresses, however, are extremely slow at attending to customers. It usually takes ages just to get their attention. Alas, they do serve a few recommendable dishes, the best being Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun aka custard pau. The custard paus are unbeatable; I have not tasted any better. The piping hot custard filling oozes out the moment you break open the skin. The sweetness of the custard and the saltiness of the preserved egg yolk make a perfect marriage. Another good dish is the Siew Mai - a dim sum classic. Their version was tasty, had a strong porky taste and had a great texture to it."

The Chinese have been getting up at noon and peeling wax paper off char siew buns for ages, and if you're sick of heavy and extravagant Western fare, but need a heart-warming Chinese entreé to start your day that won't hurt your wallet, you're at the right place.Start off by getting a basket of Victor's signature Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun ($3.50 for 3), and be careful when you split it the middle to let steam out, because the glorious golden filling might just ooze out (and make a mess!). When it's cool enough to eat, savour the sweet-salty and gooey salted egg yolk-based custard. While we're still talking buns, a basket of Milky Custard Buns ($3.50 for 3) is sure to delight both pau & dessert fans with its decadently smooth custard interior and melt-in-your-mouth silky skin.And what's Yum Cha without har gow ($3.50 for 4)? Bite into one of these steamed prawn dumplings and be surprised by the crunch - wrapped in a crystalline, semi-see-through skin are three whole shrimps and delicious pork filling. Another dumpling that is a must-have is their Tasty Queen Size Siew Mai ($3.50 for 4). Larger than your average siew mai, these bundles of joy are sure to put a smile on your face with delight, though they might be too overpowering with umami and a little bit too salty.Order a cup of Hong Kong Summer Ice Tea ($2.00) to accompany the baskets of buns and dumplings, and be impressed by their genius - the tea is served in a cup that is placed in a bowl of ice, so you don't have to worry about your tea getting too mellow with dilution"

I would say it's ok but I honestly did not find it too special and the price is not that cheap if you consider how crammed the place is and the general comfort level.  So people told me their egg yolk bun (liu sha bao) is the signature dish but I think you find similar quality ones in any of the imperial treasures or crystal jade dim sum restaurants.  I also don't think some of the items are that fresh, pretty sure it's not freshly made at the site because it's a bit too hard (esp. the char siu puff pastry).  One thing I like is their HK style milk tea which is quite authentic.  As a person with over 30 years of dim sum eating experience, I would say this is definitely not the most authentic dim sum in Singapore, there are better places at reasonable prices.  It's also not a place where you can hang out and chit chat with your friend over tea, which is what the whole yum cha experience should be about."

Headed down to Victor's Kitchen for their liu sha bao since I was nursing a serious craving for them. Well, everyone else had the same brunch idea so even though we came down at 2+pm, it was packed and the queue was long. We queued for about 15 minutes before it was our turn. Note of caution: No one is going to serve you at the front of the restaurant, so head on straight to an empty table when you sight one. The place was completely packed, and at Victor's, that means Hong Kong-style claustrophobia. Be prepared to wriggle your way in and out of the restaurant (if you can call it that) because of the ultra dense seating arrangement. After a rather unpleasantly long wait for the food, cheong fun was served. It was one of the highlights of the meal. Another winner was the steamed carrot cake that was served pudding style. I enjoyed it, but I wish it came with more sauce. Some other dishes that came were disappointing. The siew mai tasted stale, and the ha gao was over steamed. The steam pork ribs and fried toufu skin with prawns were unmemorable. Fortunately, the liu sha bao was decent and satisfied my craving. Best eaten the moment it reaches your table, this bun is filled with a sugary and salty custard that flows out the moment you sink your teeth into it. The Hong Kong iced milk tea is good too.Not the best place for dim sum, but if you want a true Hong Kong-style dim sum dining experience, head here."

Evidently, pretty much everyone else had the same bright idea. Victor's Kitchen opens at 1030am, and by the time we got there, it was packed to the brim with couples and families.Food: The glutinous rice with chicken and sausage was excellent. And this is coming from someone who's not a big fan of carbs. Really liked the zhar leung (i.e. fried doughstick in rice roll), was pretty much the closest we've had to Hong Kong fare. The har gau and siew mai were so-so, not exceptional. The carrot cake with XO sauce was unusual but not exceptional, and the custard buns were just so-so. The mango pomelo sago's pretty good. The iced milk tea though, was absolutely kickass. Victor's Kitchen is the ONLY place which serves iced milk tea identical to the famous stocking iced milk tea in Hong Kong's Fa Yuen Street.Ambience: For a relatively ghetto hole in the wall dim sum joint, it's acceptable. Service: Pretty decent, they try to do their best given the crowds. And I love being surrounded by authentic Cantonese speaking wait staff.

We used to talk about having Aroy Dee for meal everytime when we pass by Middle Road especially when this Kitchen is just located next to LE Cafe. We all heard good claims about the kitchen and perhaps why it was there for such a long time.Interior is rather modern with semi open concept kitchen. Furnishing are made up of metal chairs and wooden table with tiles flooring. They also include a mounted television for diners to watch and enjoy their meal.Thai Coconut - $4.90Clear Tom Yam Seafood Soup was appetizing and even though we forgot to instruct the server to make it less spicy, I would say that spiciness was mild and the soup really whet my appetite for more. Ingredients include fish slices, tomato, lemon grass, coriander and Sotong, which were nothing out of the normal soup we had.Tom Yum SoupPineapple fried rice portion was generous and good for sharing. Tasted mediocre with chicken floss, raisins, eggs and mixed vegetables. A bit disappointing!Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken Floss - $6.50The pandan chicken leaves were fried to crisp and required some efforts to unwrapped before we can get hold of the meat. The turmeric used was a tad too much and meat was rather soft. Overall, tasted like chicken satay to me. Dip them into the sweet and sour chilli sauce and enjoy it.Pandan Chicken - $10Phad Thai, which is always one of my favourite under the Thai Cuisine Menu was really to my liking as we prefer to have a dryer version than this. However, in terms of taste, it was still alright with the fragrant of peanuts and sweet savoury sauce coated on the noodle.Phad Thai - $6.50Thai Fried Fish was something I always wish to order but always get turned off by its expensive pricing. Due to promotion, it cost $19.90 instead of $28. Fried Garoupa was well presented with vegetables as sides sprinkled with few stalks of coriander and soaked mildly in their three taste sauce. The sauce was not too bad with sweetness, saltiness and a little sourish.Garoupa with Special Three Taste Sauce - $19.90Last but not least the papaya Salad with salty crab. There was a promotion to this item at $9 instead of $15. I'm kind of fool by the menu as I thought that it was salted egg crab. This appetiser wasnt too pleasing to us, firstly it was served when we almost finished our meal and secondly, the papaya salad was too spicy for us. In the end, we left almost 90% of the food on table.Thai Papaya Salad with Salty Crab - $9The good thing about the eating place is good for supper goers as it opens till as early as 6am in the morning. If you want to have pocket friendly food that comes with generous portion, this can be one of your choices. However, if you are particular about taste of Thai food then you have to be selective of what you are ordering in the menu. Personally, I have expected their standard items like Pineapple Fried Rice and Phad Thai to be better. Therefore, it is less likely I will be back for other items on the menu.Do note  that payment terms are only Cash or NETS."

I have to give kudos to the ladies who served our table because she was definitely accommodating to our requests - like having our army stew 'super, duper, extra spicy'. They were extremely attentive and I never had to ask for a refill of my iced barley tea, which is definitely a plus point for me because their cups are rather tiny, and I would hate being a bother who keeps asking for a refill. We got a Signature Combo where for 2 pax, you get one appetizer, one signature dish and one dessert from a selection on their menu. We were quite torn between having the Spicy Rice Cakes or the Pancake/Kimchi Pancake, but went for the first in the end - which we kinda regretted because the fish wasn't as awesome as we imagined it to be. This was I guess the let downer in the entire experience. I definitely loved the Army Stew - we got the one with assorted meat, which was really super yummy! I love that it's served to the table still 'raw' so it's cooked table top on a gas stove which is really good for me and the partner because I like my noodles chewy while he likes it soft - it was the best of both worlds. The meet assortment was rather interesting because they had luncheon meat and sausages as well. It was the first time we were trying this dish, and we can't wait to go to Korea to try the real thing on a cold winter day some time soon! We had Patbingsoo for the dessert - nothing fancy though I would have preferred that it be yoghurt rather than ice cream (substituted because I think they ran out of yoghurt for the day already) - which I guess contributed to the lack the the extra star as well because the ice cream doesn't really go with the dessert as a whole. I would definitely come here to eat again, but I'll be ordering different appetizers next time around. Oh, speaking about appetizers - the tofu with spicy-ish sesame sauce in the 6 little bowls that they give you before your meal is quite awesome!"

This place used to have snaking long lines for its stews, but now is much less popular, and I can unfortunately see why. I came here after seeing the long lines at Yoogane, thinking that Korean food can't exactly be bad right? I even ordered spicy kimchi stew ($12.90) because that's the basic Korean food that's literally impossible to get wrong right? Sadly no. It was a little too salty and tasted of MSG, not the usual pork stew or even tofu taste. The tofu was tough. It didn't even come with white rice. My friend ordered the set with jjajiangrice & dumplings. The dumplings tasted alright but overall average. The appetizers served with the meal were also very tiny plates & subpar. If you're looking for authentic Korean food, don't bother! You can get a good meal for less at so many other places, even the food court is better."

Ordered their second combo set for $48.90 suitable for 2 pax but several of the items were pretty bad (EXCEPT their kimchi chigae and grilled salmon!). The beef bibimbap was really dry and tasteless, the beef in it was very dry as well, it was burnt even before we started stirring. Took 2 spoons of the bimbap and that was it. In addition, their 4 side dishes was also dry and somewhat stale, they have pre-prepared them, left it in the open before serving us (oh god). The kimchi chigae was a real redemption though! It was so nice. Tangy and sour, I'm sure they cooked it with real homemade kimchi. Appreciate that. It's quite additive btw. Grilled salmon was a good too. Hygiene wise the place was ok but I've got this impression it isn't clean either. The plates/spoons were slightly dirty, u can see some remnants still attached to them even after washing.I had to use the wet tissue to clean them before dining. Service wise, it was relatively good, staffs were friendly and smiley :) Maybe this restaurant is good for their army stew (as I see many people having that), I've yet tried it so can't comment.

I've tried the Pad Thai here and the Pineapple Rice, and both are so worthy of coming back for more, especially for this price. In Thai Gold, you could easily get a hearty genuine thai meal for less than $8. My serving of Pineapple Rice cost no more than $5, and was filling enough for one. The rice was very well oiled and cooked, strategically filled with pineapple and topped with pork floss and cashew nuts. Very tasty, very fragrant. My counterpart today had the rice with fried garlic chicken, which was surprisingly amazing, and literally blew my mind with how crisp it was, and how rich the garlic taste was. The tenderness was also something I hadn't expected from a shop that serves out food as cheap and quick as this. One dampener for me is the thai iced tea, which looked good with its layers, but wasn't very 'together', even if it was very sweet and thick. In summary: great great value, good genuine thai food.

Perhaps I'll sit further inside, away from the kitchen the next time."

The quesadillas were good, even though the fillings were distributed a little unevenly. Chicken wings were good too, with a very good crunch to them, but just slightly over-salty. For mains, we had the laksa, braised beef shin, chicken parmigiana and honey berry ribs. The laksa was surprisingly the best dish of the lot, although 12.90 for laksa is rather expensive. The parmigiana was tasty, but don't order it if you don't like your food deep fried. Some of the ends were almost charred. Almost. The beef shin was tagged to be the best dish of the lot, but unfortunately it was pretty ordinary,like stir fried beef at a zhichar stall. The honey Berry ribs were alright, although I couldn't taste the honey or Berry in the sauce. The ribs themselves were fall-odf-the-bone tender, but slightly underseasoned. Now all the food was served with impeccable timing. The appetisers were served first, and once they were done, all the mains came together..  Except the ribs. Unfortunately the waiter forgot to key in my order, and the ribs only arrived 15 minutes after everyone else had finished their mains. The waiter was of course apologetic,and I found it hard to lose my cool when scripture was hanging on the wall right in front of me. Overall, the food was good but somehow just missed the mark by a little bit. If it weren't for the forgotten order, I'd have given it 5 stars."

Came here after attending a visual art exhibition at Singapore Arts Museum (walkable distance) and since there were quite a number of space, we managed to get seated on a comfy sofa like chair. The waiter approached us checking whether we would want some iced water while we decide on our orders. It was a nice professional gesture from their end. After browsing through a one double sided menu, I decided to order the following.1) Wanted to order root beer but it was out of stock. Same with my friends' orders of Ginger beer.2) Decided to order Snapple's pink lemonade instead.3) Chilli crab pasta sounded good at that moment so decided to order that. They ran out of Fettuccine so I had to change the pasta to spaghetti instead. Verdict: pasta was warm when it was served, chewy and tender in terms of texture. The  deep fried soft shell crab were both delicious and crunchy (managed to get the ones with eggs) and the Crossings' own chilli crab claw meat sauce were flavorful and hint of spicy made the dish special. (definitely recommended)4) My friend ordered fish and chips. The fish batter was pretty good and the portion of the fish fillet was bigger than expected too. 5) Hazelnut molten cake with ice cream. The dish was warm when it arrived to our table. The chocolate was a little bitter but the cake was moist and soft. Combined with the vanilla ice cream, it is one of best lava cake in Singapore. Overall, price wise it was quite affordable and considering that profits will be directed to charities made this place a gem. The service was excellent too as they checked on the customers' needs quickly when customers raised their hands. As my friends and I left for this place, we were also greeted with a thanks. Will be back soon for more yummy goodies :)"

As a social enterprise, I am very impressed with the level of service delivered by servers who are challenged in different special ways. They are professional and extremely polite. The greatest I derive from dining at this place is the fact that not only do I get good food and good service, all profits are donated to charity! So as I enjoy a good meal, I am also able to contribute to the society. What more can I ask?There are many places that use the term social enterprise very loosely and patrons suffer either from high price (in the name of social cause and benefit) or bad food/service and we are expected to be understanding because the special needs or at-risk individuals are involved. That should not be the case. Quality and experience should not be compromised for the sake of social good. I fully support Crossings because they have created an environment that bring out the best in all the staff, regardless of their special needs and patrons are always well taken care of. Respect!"

As a Lasalle student, this is an ideal place for a quick bite. Prices are moderate though can be lower for certain stalls.As the place recently finished renovations, the premises looks cleaner and more updated. Welcome to 2015, Broadway. The current problem with the place is the insufficient quantity of halal makan stalls. The only one that is qualified as halal is Indian * Pakistan Cuisine. The stall is run by an Indian man with, whom I believe is his mother, in the kitchen. I ordered the Butter Chicken with Naan, costing $7.50. There was an option to take Naan, but I wasn't sure if it was chargeable or complimentary. The food comes as 1 plate of naan and 1 boat of butter curry with the chicken inside it. The naan tasted fresh and excellent as it is cooked and prepared from dough on the spot. The butter curry tastes strong and feels rather sweet as well, though this is expected of butter. The chicken cutlets which are soaked in the curry are also savory and taste delicious. I decided to go for a mini taco kinda thing and wrapped pieces of naan with curry and chicken. Simply excellent. With that said, the price is a little steep but is justified by the taste and cost of ingredients. Broadway has finally upped its game but holds potential in the future by possibly adding more halal food.Definitely a place to go for now as a regular makan place, assuming you're not Muslim."

It was located near Bras Basah MRT Station (CC2). As it was a week day night, the restaurant was not crowded and we were showed to a private room for our dinner. The room was big with at least 4 tables. It was full glass window where one can have a good view of outside. As Melvin was a regular customer, he had done some  consulting with the chef about the menu. He decided on what was fresh and what was the chef's best dishes.We started the meal with Roasted Suckling Pig. Surprisingly it was served with the sweet sauce underneath. The skin was crispy and fatty part was simply melted in the mouth.Next we had double boiled soup. Inside the soup, there was shark's fin, dried scallop, whelk, ginseng, chicken,and chinese ham. The soup was very flavourful.For the fish dish, we had Baked fish with Cream Sauce. It was served with asparagus. The fish was simply melted in the mouth. Everyone agreed that it was the best dish of this meal.Next we had Stir Fried Scallop and Shimeji Mushroom with XO sauce. Tasted slightly spicy, the scallop was quite juicy.This was followed by the Crispy Roasted Chicken. It was served topped with crispy curry leaves, almond slices, sliced chilli, and savoury crispy bites. I like the savoury crispy bites which added another layer of taste to the roasted chicken.For the vegetable dish, we had Braised Abalone with seasonal vegetables. It was served with shiitake mushroom and spinach. The abalone was well flavoured here.For the carbohydrates, we had Lotus Leaf Rice. The glutinous rice flavoured with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, and chinese ham. The rice was not too mushy.Lastly for dessert, we had Hashima. It was served hot, with longan, red date, ginseng, and lotus seed. It did not taste too sweet. The lotus seed was well cooked and soft to bite. Hashima is made from the dried fatty tissue found near the fallopian tubes of true frogs. The version here was simply melted in the mouth.Overall the food was very good. Although I did not get to see the actual bill, but it was about $100 per person for this meal. Sounded expensive but it was expected considering the expensive items ordered. The staffs were friendly. Plates were replaced for every dish. The manager and even the chef also came over to check on our table. Guess Melvin was such a VIP here."

When I was there, bottles started at $30 (!!!) and that made me a very happy customer. Also, despite the price tag, they were very decent bottles.The food here was quite good, the only thing I have to say is that French food is on the heavy side. The bone marrow was super generous - it came with 3 giant bones which you can scrape out deliciously onto toasted bread. The pork rilette was also yummy and went well with the pickled cornichons provided on the side. The mains are well priced as well, and while I liked my Kurobuta t-bone, it all became quite heavy. I was not a fan of their desserts though.I think this place would do great as a place for a drink and a bite! I will probably come back for the very reasonably priced drinks."

Upon being seated, we were informed of a long list of items that were no longer available due to missing ingredients. Our server was clueless about the menu and how items were prepared when we inquired. After ordering, someone came over to tell us that they were out of heirloom tomatoes so they needed to modify the dish we ordered for regular tomatoes. I ordered an iced latte. They forgot to bring sugar or sweetners so after requesting it and waiting far too long with no action, I went to the bar and picked some up. After tasting it, the latte was way too strong and I requested a hot latte instead. The server asked several questions asking if it could be modified, I responded no, she finally took it away. Awhile later she arrived with the replacement, right before I drank from it, she came and took it away saying it was hot chocolate (a mistake). She later returned with what looked like the same drink (now barely hot) and I could finally consume my mediocre coffee. Then the food came out, I ordered the croque monsieur with fried eggs. It barely resembled any croque monsieur I've ever had. It was also extremely bland. I had to add salt and pepper to give it some flavor. We were then ignored forever, ran out of water and only got a refill when we asked for it. To make matters worse, a few hours later, as I prepared to head out for the evening, I got a horrible stomachache. My boyfriend had to run out to get me medicine and we spent the rest of our first day in Singapore in bed. This restaurant not only ruined our meal, but also our first of only three days in the city. With so many great places to eat in Singapore, DON'T GO HERE AND REGRET IT LIKE US!"

The original reason we came to Rex was supposed to be for its chicken rice. This however was disappointing to half the people eating it's supposed to be the top 10 chicken rice. The chicken was good tasting but fairly dry. The rice can be a little more fragrant and the chili more viscous as it is a little dilute and thin.

Chicken soft bone was not soft at all, overly fried and hard. Gyozas were ok only, as were the skewers. On hindsight I should have just eaten 4 croquettes instead.

Anyway, the menu has a pretty good offering of dishes, including escargot in garlic butter. The pork tonkatsu was moist but a little fatty for my liking. The panko crust was delicate and didn't leave you that oily mouth feel. The Tonteki pork steak was good too and pan-fried perfectly. The fatty parts had a nice char and the meat was tender and juicy. Usually, the Tonteki comes smothered in their ""Original Tonkatsu Sauce"" which I'm glad I asked for on the side because although it was tasty in a Worcestershire sauce kinda way, it would have overwhelmed the pork steak. Plenty of beer and wine selection to choose from. Didn't have room for dessert, but there is a large offering of it if you are so inclined to indulge in.

Tasty and fills me up - it comes with fries and a bed of bean sprouts. Kinda reminds me of a glorified pepper lunch. It was served in an interesting manner too - The waiter will pour some sort of liquid on your egg and burger, and it would light up for awhile before she pours another liquid on top of it to put the fire out.After serving your meal, your waiter will give you a key which you will then take to the cashier to pay your bill and ""check out"" of this lovely B&B. cute eh?"

Last year, while looking for places to eat on a Friday night at Liang Court, I stumbled across this strange French cottage-looking restaurant with tons of ladies waiting outside. Couldn't put two together and moved on. Earlier this year, after moving to my new workplace at Suntec, a friend suggested we have lunch at Ma Maison at Bugis Junction. When I walked in (once again, there was a line for lunch), everything clicked!I've only had the Ma Maison set meals with grilled steak, hamburg steak and tonkatsu because someone told they're really good at the hamburg. Why order anything else if a restaurant is great with it's grill right? All of those dishes have been fantastic, with the hamburg steak taking the cake no matter what sauce I've had it with. Plus if you're feeling thirsty, they have a good range of beers by the bottle and some very appetizing tarts that I've *yet* to try.What really rocks my boat however is the service. For Singapore standards, the Bugis outlet has some of the best service I've experienced in this country. From the usual embarrassing welcome you get at Japanese restaurants to accommodating substitutions, explaining sauces and keeping my water glass filled, the staff here get top marks. It's one of the few times I find myself saying, ""boy do the Japanese know how to train their service staff right"" because they all look happy and serve professionally. I do notice that the Japanese managers pay more attention to Japanese customers, but hey I would too if I was working in a foreign country and the ""less attentive"" level already exceeds most competitors. However, I would point out that service at the Parco Millenia restaurant is not great and borders on rude on occasion because, well you guessed it, there are no Japanese managers on site and the outlet seems severely understaffed. One can't have everything so I suggest sticking to Bugis Junction. Lastly, come early or past 1pm during lunchtime to avoid lining up for long. Forget dinner on Mondays (ladies happy hour) or Fridays if you're starving and don't want to wait."

The lighting's a little dim, but it adds to the cosy atmosphere of the restaurant. I had the Gratin with Prawns and Scallops ($13.80), which was pretty good, but they were rather miserly with the actual prawns and scallops - there were only two pieces of each in the large bowl. My friend had the Fresh Greens salad ($6.90) with Japanese dressing - I wasn't too impressed with that. We ended the meal with a Strawberry Tart ($8.80) - the most popular out of at least five different flavours of tarts - and it was not bad. However, the tart base was almost like a very dry cake which I feel did not complement the texture of the strawberries.Ma Maison is known for their sincere approach to food, and it shows through their simple yet delicious dishes.

Followed these up with Camembert Cheese Fritters that were also really yummy, although I would have preferred a different sauce, the one we had oddly resembled Thai sweet chilli.The Beef Stroganoff served with Buttered rice and omelette was a bit disappointing despite my love of Japanese rice. The omelette threw me off a bit and overall the meal could do without.The desserts were the real treat here.

And, based on the recommendations, it came down to Chikuyotei vs. Mikuni.I decided to give Chikuyotei a try and it didn't disappoint me. Even though Chikuyotei is specialized in Edo style unagi but also has Mikawa style of Unagi (Histumabashi). My wife had Edo style and I had Mikawa style. The former one is steam first then grill with light sauce, while the later one is grill with smokey texture and taste. I can't comment on Mikuni unagi yet, however, Chikuyotei's unagi is as authentic as you can get. And  comparing with Yanagawa unagi (which it was my all time favorite), Chikuyotei's Hitsumabashi is on par with Yanagawa unagi. Highly recommend if you are crazy about unagi. Mikawa style unagi costs $80 for a lunch set and Edo style unagi starting price is $40 for a lunch set, both are 200g of unagi."

Got the least expensive fixed price lunch. Was there the first day it opened after the renovation. Minimalistic decor so not sure what they renovated. Not very crowded. They sat me at the counter since I was dining alone. Strangely they have wait service at the counter. First course was flounder (3 thin slices) with salt and truffle oil. Two bites of peeled asparagus and a small piece of tomato. The flounder was heaven on earth! I could have eaten 10 more servings of that!! The second course was a salad. Very refreshing with flower petals, different lettuces, and a few other veggies. Next was the tempura. This was the best mushroom I ever had in my life, plus two pieces of fresh shrimp/prawns, and a pepper (which was good and crispy but I didn't eat).Next was a crab meatball in clear soup. The snow crab ball had a consistency that did not appeal to me so I didn't eat it after tasting it. But the smell and taste of the clear broth was incredible and I devoured every last drop and all the green floating in it.  This was another course I could have made a meal out of by ordering 10 of them!! The Tuna on rice ruined me forever. The tuna melted in my mouth. The rice was delicious that I ate the whole bowl. I asked the sushi chef the secret. He said the secret is red vinegar not white. He also said everything is imported, salt , sugar, rice, etc. I chatted with my sushi chef. He shared with me that the knives are sharpened every day and he showed me his name in Chinese on his knife. I watch him ""garnish"" a dish with the most delicate small flowers; he explained that they can also be put in soy sauce to add flavor.Service was ok. Some dishes came out too fast, I got my first dish before my drink, I was asked if I needed anything else and informed they were closing for lunch before my dessert came, and I had to ask for the check."

Both the chicken dishes were quite good with the chicken being quite tender and tasty. The fish dish which used sea bass was a little on the fishy side for me. The fries were perfectly prepared and pretty tasty too. I also snacked on one of Brotzeit' famous pretzels which was served warm and darn tasty as well.

The fans keep it a pretty nice temperature. Only problem, your food cools quicker. I got the jagerschnitzel which was good. Different then I expected but still good. I was expecting it to still have all the breading with the mushroom sauce. It wasn't really breaded. The mash potatoes reminded me of my Oma's so that was great. I enjoyed eating here.

How wrong can you go with bratwurst and sausages? Besides the beer options, there are wine and mocktail and other non-alcoholic drinks. If you are a light drinker or not that into beer, the mixed beer option is good. I like the Russ'n which is Weissbier mixed with lemonade.

Fried Rice: Didn't try it, however everyone else gobbled it up!Shrimp paste wrapped in fried bean curd skin: Crispy outside, steamy inside! Black Crab Chili Buns: My goodness, I crave these little guys! They're absolutely stunning and in a way they look exciting. They look like pure black buns in a muffin/cupcake cup. When you bite into it, you get this sweet flavor from the bun with a hint of spiciness from the stringy crab. It was silky smooth, and delicious. This is their signature dish, and would recommend everyone trying it. I even tried to find online recipes, however I cannot! Mango pudding: Delicious, it was almost like a mango cream/milk jello, with mango bits inside of it. It was sweet, cool, and refreshing.Service: Very quick, most of the folks at my table were not familiar with the dishes and they came by to explain to them. I also asked for serving spoons, and they promptly gave them to us as well. These guys are excellent and super attentive.Come to this restaurant, you won't regret it!"

My research pointed me towards Jumbos, No Signboard and Long Beach. A few others popped up here and there, including Red House. I didn't think much of this one, but when the day I decided to venture out to get my chilli crab fix turned out to be a stormy day filled with rainstorms, I had to choose the easiest to get to. Red House was a mere two blocks from my hotel so that was an easy choice.At 1:30PM, the restaurant was still filled with families, tourists and businessmen having lunch. Dim sum was apparently still available as most of the tables were eating that. I noticed one table next to me with the crab - and only two people. That made me feel a little bit better, as I wouldn't be the only one making a mess of myself during lunch. Chilli crab, to say the least, can get a bit messy.I ordered the smallest crab available, which was still over 2 lbs. An order of mandou was standard as well. The staff brought out everything I would need to conquer my crab - claws, crackers, water with lemon, wet naps and a bib. When it came, I knew there was NO WAY I was going to finish it. It was HUGE. And then I had a taste of that slightly spicy, very sweet tomato sauce and had to sigh. It was easily the best taste of my entire trip. I did not intend on finishing it - I swear. But before I knew it, the entire crab was gone. The staff was surprised, I could tell. They were watching me eat through the entire meal, which was fine as my water bowl and teapot was constantly replenished. This meal was not cheap - my crab alone was $60 USD. But so, so worth it. It was the perfect meal to end a 11 day foodie adventure."

The service is a bit gruff and reminds me of Chinatown restaurants in ny. Which is fine if the food makes up for it. And it totally does! Razor clams that are huge with some amazing garlic noodle topping. And the crab! I didn't care that I got it all over my rings and my elbow and hair and clothes and face. If I wasn't so full I'd drink that sauce straight up. Had one fried bun which was so soft and hot and yummy. But mostly just ate crab like a savage with my teeth. Using the crackers when necessary. Sweet and slightly spicy and messy and sticky and delicious. My favorite Singapore dining experience of the trip. My friends had some steamed fish and it looked nice but I had no room left to try. They chose the Sri Lankan crab and not sure why but so much sweet meat. Love chili crab!

The chili crab bao were just okay.  A bit under-salted, not as flavorful as I expected.  I wish they would pay more attention to how they make these.  I used them as a taste test to determine whether I would return to try their chili crab, after tasting these I think I'll pass. The bbq pork in pastry was really good. The best I've had so far. Huge chunks of meat and the bbq sauce was not overwhelming. It was perfect. Service was great, prompt and attentive.

The latter are thick, creamy, but lightly flavoured and tangy.As for the rice-based dishes, the store isn't stingy with the rice: it usually arrives in the shape of a mountain, with the other ingredients in generous portions.The feel of the restaurant is very old-school, simple and plain with no frills.

Went to this outlet on a Sunday afternoon. Was expecting it to be crowded but amazingly our suspicions were wrong. We were seated quite quickly.Coming to an all you can eat sushi, I thought there was a price difference for the plate colors but it was $1.60 without gst. The ambience of this outlet was pretty nice. The seats were actually sofa seats and there was an iPad where you could order additional items which wasn't on the conveyor belt.I went with a group of 10 and we were divided to 6 and 4 each table. The food on the conveyor belt kept rotating and I tried some of the two piece sushi. Taste wise is pretty good. Chewy rice and ingredients are considered fresh.We also ordered a side of salmon sashimi and some of the group ordered rolls. It was pretty good. A sweet tooth person (referring to myself) won't go off without desserts. Tried the strawberry mochi. Was chewy and not as sweet as I thought it would be. I also tried the cheesecake. Couldn't resist the temptation of seeing it on the belt rotating three to five times when we were there. Price wise it was good. But the cheesecake wasn't as moist as it should be - what can you expect for $1.60. When we paid, we were given vouchers - a business tactic to get us back there again,  which can be used within 3 months of date of issue. Overall, I am very satisfied with the food. I'll probably give full star if the space was spacious and efficient staffs. Will be back again soon :)"

It was great to try different kinds.The Aloo Gobi (cauliflower and potatoes) was kind of mushy and could've tasted better.The Chicken Makhanwala (butter chicken) was perfect with the naan bread.If you like bread, the bread basket was perfect! Plain and garlic naan, roomali roti (thin chappati-yum!), and tandoori parantha (also yum!)We tried the Jal Jeera to drink and it was very different and not something I would recommend. Can't go wrong with the Mango Lassi though.Unfortunately we were disappointed with the service. It could've been much better for the price we pay. Servers didn't clear our table or refill our waters.

We came here before when it wasn't crowded and got seated right away. The food wasn't the best but I will give it a 3 cause they are consistent with the flavor and quality. We are always in the Novena branch and didn't have any problem, even the supervisor or owner treat everyone accordingly. The problem with the Bugis branch was they let  a customer get seated and order food even the rest of the party were not present yet. The line was long and we were waiting already for 30min before telling us we need to wait 30 minutes more. I bluntly told them it was unfair for us who were waiting in line and they shouldnt have took the order when the clients weren't  presently seated altogether. The staff just smiling mockingly when I told them that they should've told us right away from the start so we shouldnt have wasted our  time waiting  for a while. There's  a lot restaurants in the area better than their  food; it's not worth the wait. I will go back to the Novena branch which is highly recommendable . I was going to inform the manager but got no time  so I hope someone in charge would see this review to  train their staff how to handle customer professionally. I will not recommend this branch to anyone and would never go back no matter how close it is to our house."

On top of Mount Emily. I like the concept as I felt secluded from the rest of the world - and pretty close to the stars in the sky.Location: The location is such a b*tch. It is almost inaccessible without a car but I am blessed with friends who don't mind ferrying me around.Ambience: Very laid-back vibe. You can come dressed down or up (friendly hang-out with friends whom you don't quite care about - shorts + tee + flip-flops or not-so-innocent hang-out with a date whom you are trying to impress - pretty dress / shirt + heels) - as it was pretty dark outdoors and so no one could judge your dressing. Problem I had was the tables were placed quite closely together ... and there weren't many people on a Fri night (maybe fewer than 4 tables were filled up in total) - and so you could literally listen into other people's conversations as it could be quite quiet up the hill. and my friends were quite wasted and sprouting a lot of embarrassing shit about me.Drinks: There's an 1-on-1 happy hour deal from Tues-Sat for house pours, wines and beers before 9PM. You could order your drinks and place them on tab before 9PM ... and the servers would only bring them out later when you want them (even after 9PM) - that was pretty sweet service. I had a bit too much to drink - and they cancelled my last two merlot without charging me - even sweeter.Food: Share a partial menu with sister restaurant, Wild Rocket next door - I think some of the food came out of Wild Rocket's kitchen. Mostly tapas style (so the mini fish-and-chips was really mini). Fish and chips was below mediocre - the 'fish fingers' were overly battered, with absolute lack of fish mince. BUT - its sarawak chicken curry shepherd's pie was so yummilious - one of the best Asian-Western fusion dish ever had. Curry + Mashed potato sounds like a great combination. Throw in the cheese - it might be a bit too over-the-top - but somehow Wild Rocket got all three (curry, mashed potato and cheese) together to awe my tastebuds.Overall - worth a visit, but I don't think I will be back here too soon ..."

The mee sua was a bit more sticky and soggy. The sauce could also be better. At $3.50 it is the same price as Yan Kee but this seemed to have more ingredients. Besides mee sua, you could have the usual mee pok or mee kia and other noodle items. I also ordered bak kut teh as I wanted the soup. I chose the premium which came with long rib bones, instead of the usual chopped up shorter or smaller ribs/bones. The soup is of the clear peppery kind, with no herbal taste. It was good but I would not say mind blowing. As I hardly have BKT, I do not know much about it. It is pricey at $6 for just 3 ribs. The soup is refillable.

I chanced upon this stall on my way to liang seah street to hunt for other food stalls. So my colleagues and I, 4 of us, decided to give this stall a try as it truly looks appealing!We ordered 2 bowls of the signature bak kut teh, 1 sliced pork soup, 1 pigs stomach soup, 1 preserved vegetables and braised pork, 2 bowls of you tiao and completed with rice and vermicelli. Total bill is slightly less than S$50, which I thought it's slightly on the high side for bak kut teh.The taste of the soup is not that peppery spicy, and I think it's good for tourist. This is easy drinking soup, and it's not too bad. Being a Singaporean myself, I prefer my bak kut teh to have stronger punch of the black and white pepper combination! The pig's stomach is great, and really cleaned properly with no nasty smell. I've a mixed feeling with the preserved vegetables with braised pork. It's well flavored, a hit on the salty side, and they used thick slices of pork belly to braise it with the vegetables. The skin of the pork belly is yummy, but the meat is dry, like really dry which I thought it's kind of weird on a pork belly. The pork ribs from the soup are also dry and tasteless, and I feel that there's a lack of fragrance in the soup, probably ties in with the lack of pepper and onion.Well, this is ok for me and it's probably somewhere I will bring friends traveling from states here to try. Local taste bud, not really."

The Carbonara was lovely as it was not drowned in sauce like how a lot of places does it. It was however a little more to the dry side and I did wish for just a tiny bit more sauce. This fish was by far my favorite, golden crunch on the outside and moist on the inside.

In short - the food was just no good.I went for lunch and had a grilled chicken with salad for $8.90. Sounded promising. The chicken was a chicken chop (thigh, whole piece) - and was just passable, and not very different from the sort of chicken chop you get from a western food stall in the hawker centre. It came with a small side salad that was lettuce greens and tomatoes. The chicken was covered with a cheesy (I think) sauce. It was just meh. I would not go back for this food.One other thing - when our food was served, my friend asked the wait staff what the sauce was (as it was not indicated on the menu). She just smiled and said she was ""not sure"". That was it. Not sure. Didn't bother to find out either.Nice try, won't go back. Sorry.

For those who are spoiling for some good dim sum, this place is pretty good- their buns follow all the traditional ""folds"", have authentic flavor and their soup buns are a must have. We ordered the vegetarian dumplings, shrimp and veggie noodle, a cold beef sliced appetizer, 1 si gua shrimp soup dumpling, 1 regular soup dumpling, a round of garlic fried spinach, and shrimp fried rice. Food:1. Cold cut beef appetizer - The art of this beef is that it is marbled when you see it sliced and laid out so delicately in the thinnest slices and the marble is so intricate that it's a true delicacy hard to rival in anything I've seen in the US. the beef is well flavored and must be eaten cold as that what makes the marbled texture stay- eat this warm, and it will melt the marbled cartilage. I have attached a picture with a cup of tea next to it for comparison and it's remarkable how delicate the cut is. Not an oily dish, almost like a refreshing wet beef jerky if one were to describe the flavor. 2. Steamed vegetarian dumplings- 10 for 11.80$- For my vegetarian friends, this is the dish to get. The dumpling has various tofu and chives and vermicelli wrapped inside- it is flavorful and the green wrapping is a lovely color to see when they lift the lid off the steamer. 3. Steamed gourd and shrimp ""soup"" dumpling- 10 for 11$- if you're a soup bun fan, you want to try this version- it has the crunchy but yet tender soft si gua and the shrimp inside. The soup is a sweeter and more vegetable taste than its other famous typical counterpart, the vegetable and pork soup bun 4. Steamed vegetable and pork dumpling 10 for 10.30$- Gotta get the staple of soup buns if you're going to have good soup dumplings and a good dim sum set. There are the 13 folds that are described as the art of folding a true ""delicacy"" correctly that one will not find in American dim sum stores that usually just fold a dumpling minus the 13 folds. pick this up with chopsticks at the tip and put it into a soup spoon before eating. wait a min for it to cool or bite a small hole on top and drink the soup inside slowly as it will be hot. 5. Stir fried spinach /w garlic for 10.80$\- not over cooked and has the garlic flavor- still maintains the crisp and jade green flavor that spinach should have6. Fried rice w/ shrimp and eggs for 12.80$-  a truly rich and buttery fried rice that screams generous eggs, butter, and shrimp. highly recommend this is if you are a fan of fried rices- this is truly a must have."

Even though the similar, they taste just as good and remember to go with the ginger sauce.Some of the details you might notice is the number of folds on the xiao long bao, it is supposed to have 18 folds and I can't be sure if you can request to change if it counts less or more than 18. It would be ridiculous though. The skin of the dumpling is thin but good enough to hold the soup and meat in it. It didn't stick on the wet cloth which is good.Service at the restaurant is good, the waitresses and waiters are responsive and willing to take the initiative."

Anywhere with a long line or plenty of diners is always a good indicator, especially if the diners are older. They are usually there for the food or cheap pricing, and not because the place looks hipster and the food looks instagram worthy.  I walked past Mata Thai several times and it was always packed with diners, especially during meal times. Located in a corner of a HDB block, it is fairly spacious as they also took up the space in front of the restaurant. I was there for a late lunch and it was a lull period with just 4 or 5 tables being occupied. More people came in shortly after me. I guessed when the food is good, people can eat round the clock in Singapore. The tom yam seafood soup was not fiery hot like other places, but it had a good balance of spicy and tang. It only came in 2 sizes - small and big. The small was sufficient to feed 2-3 persons if you also ordered other items.The basil chicken with rice and fried egg was a single person's portion and it was pretty good. It could do with more basil but I am quibbling here. The papaya salad was the special add on for that day and it was really nice. I am usually not a fan of papaya salad but this was refreshing and not overly spicy. The winner of the day was really the Thai iced milk tea. I loved how they let you mix it so you know it was made fresh on the spot. It tasted like those in Bangkok. Delicious. And for $1.50, it was quite a steal, especially when you have paid $1.60 for iced Milo at the coffee shop at the other end of the same HDB block a few hours ago.They take cash or NETS only."

I could count the ingredients inside, a handful of noodles, 2 prawns, 1 slice of squid and 2 slices of pork. That was it. The chili condiment sauce tasted good, slightly on the sour side with a tangy twist. The most generous must be the portions of pork lard. Served lukewarm, and therefore altering the taste, making it greasy and hard to digest.Every time I taste this the food has been inconsistent, they need to do something before they need to go through round 2 of ""bad business revival""."

For a century egg, a prawn fritter and beancurd, plus a side of fried been hoon, it came to $4.50. This is similar to Indian Rojak as you get to pick and choose the items you want.

Love the carbonara with bacon, the creamy white sauce taste homemade, poached egg is well-cooked, spaghetti is Q, portion is just right. Love the waffle with chocolate ice cream. The waffle may look simple and plain, but that's the beauty of it. It is perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Goes really well with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. One of the best waffle I've ever had.Love the hot chocolate (70% dark chocolate). Rich and creamy and taste like a bar of dark chocolate.  Love the chicken nuggets. Crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. Overall, service and ambience is good, menu is well categorized for easy ordering. Just hope that they show a list of food photos on the menu so that those who has not been there before, know what to expect and order from the menu."

They had 4 choices for 'soup of the day' which really should be soups of the day. We had the mushroom soup and it was quite pleasant. Beef cottage pie was not available so we thought of going for more desserts since there was a rave about it here.Waffle is a must; come early for it so that waiting time won't be long. When asked what was ""eton mess"", the staff said ""choc cake"", and what was ""blackout"", she said ""choc cake"". Could have been a little more specific and professional in this. In the end she recommended the blackout which was a total disappointment because it's just a very moist chocolate cake.Price is on the high.

Ironically, the desserts did not impress even though Wimbly Lu is famous for them.   The Hazelnut Butterscotch Blondie ($4.50) was too dry and chalky with rancid untoasted nuts though the butterscotch sauce was rich and sweet. I don't understand the logic of molten lava cakes  $6without ice cream or creme anglaise sauce but I know some do. The version here is very rich, dense and luckily not too sweet. However, the cake texture was still dry as compared to Domino's or Morgansfield.   The Chocolate Tofu Cake $6 did not taste anything of tofu but I guessed the ingredient blended into the mousse did help to give it a smooth, creamy texture. However, the biscuit base was stale and not crunchy as described by the staff.   With a crisp texture and some even noted a resemblance with cereal taste, the signature waffles with one scoop ice cream ($8.50) was the better ones that day. I wonder if the salted caramel ice cream came from Salted Caramel at Upp Thomson though. But it was too small a scoop for the size of the waffles.Mediocre Cheese Toast Melts which can be skipped Another recommended item was the Chocolate Root Beer Cake $6. Think layers of root-beer-infused ganache intersecting with chocolate sponge. I like chocolate and root beer. But the combination of both tasted strange.Blackout Cake $6Bottomline, a cafe that is simply over-rated. Perhaps it is crowded because the seats are limited. My companions were generous to comment that the ambience was good, for instance the settings such as the red bricks tiled wall and lightings. But I tend to ignore ambience and focus on the food. Given the substandard quality of the chocolate desserts, I would not fancy a return."

My evidence: the staff were visibly buzzing around inside before they opened, and they could have been tweaking the decor! Also, I've seen pictures of the café filled with little hearts, all posted in February, as well as other similar pictures with Halloween lanterns. I'd be very impressed if they actually hung those raining clouds to reflect the weather outside! It really added a fantastic touch to Wimbly Lu's intimate and personal setting.To make sure that my friend and I were having a legitimate lunch and not just stuffing our faces with desserts instead of having a proper meal, we ordered a double seafood and cheese toasty ($6) which was so-so.Me made our next choice from having read other reviews and recommendations - waffle with salted caramel ice cream, plus a topping of maple syrup. ($8.50)This waffle was pretty much perfect, it really hit that criteria of a crisp exterior and fluffy insides. From what I've heard, every single waffle served is just as perfect! Talk about quality control.The salted caramel ice cream was delicious - flavourful but not sickeningly sweet. We definitely could have had a bigger scoop. The maple syrup was a good choice of topping as well.Now I'm no expert on sticky date pudding, as this was my first one ever. I've got to say that it was delightful! Warm, gooey, sweet, and addictive. I only got to taste dates in my last mouthful, though. I'm not sure if sticky date puddings have to taste strongly of dates.It would have made more sense for the dense, rich pudding to come with pouring cream or ice cream, but it didn't, so we ordered an addition scoop of honey cinnamon ice cream. ($3)The cinnamon taste was a little stronger than expected, which was a surprise, but a good one - like apple pie in ice cream form! There wasn't much taste of honey, it was probably used mainly to sweeten. The ice cream flavour didn't go that well with the pudding. However, the texture was perfect in my terms. Not too icy, yet not too heavy and gooey - somewhere among that blissful in between. We found ourselves craving more of that honey cinnamon ice cream!With service charge, the bill came to somewhere around $25 in total for the both of us, which is pretty reasonable for the great atmosphere and food. Wimbly Lu is definitely somewhere I'll return to for a relaxed dessert experience the next time I visit Singapore!"

You might actually have better luck locating the Cafe than an empty parking lot!My fave there gotta be their Rootbeer Cake.Who in the world will think that rootbeer infused chocolate cake would taste so good! With a scope of vanilla ice cream, the combination is just like a regular rootbeer float just that instead of drinking, you are actually eating it.The salted caramel truffle has a touch of chocolate bitterness that fuses with the sweet and salty caramel. Rich and tantalising, it's a really cool chocolate treat! If you can't get enough of the chocolate, try their chocolate molten lava cake. There's seriously more ""molten chocolate"" than cake in this dessert. Havent had the chance to try their savoury dishes but their desserts are definitely good enough for me. ;)"

However, the food ranged from average (at best) to disappointing. But we loved the ambiance so much that the food didn't really mattered all that much after awhile. I would recommend you stick with the ""safer"" choices then sit back, relax & enjoy the place. Read a book. It's a beautiful way to spend a lazy sunday afternoon :) The food (desserts) 1. Root beer cake - We saw many tables order this + It was highly instagramed + It was a chef's choice... so we went against our gut feeling (which was warning us that root-beer & chocolate will probably taste weird) and order it. Sadly, our guts were right! This tasted pretty strange! I am a fan of root beer and chocolate. But not both together. Lesson learnt. 2. Waffles with salted caramel ice cream & toffee sauce - Since we went for a risky choice with #1, we decided opt for a safer choice with the waffles which was not bad. Average. Safe. Expected. My only complain was the toffee sauce which tasted nothing like the sticky, rich brown toffee sauce I expected. This was a translucent, honey colored liquid which tasted more like a cheap syrup than toffee! The salted caramel ice cream was also more salty than I'd prefer. 3. Honey lemon - Ok4 Scones - A good safe choice. Served with cream and jam... just the way I like my scones :) Service - Great."

My neighbour told me about their molten lava cake and smores pie, which is then what we ordered. Chocolate overload!The molten lava cake was not as sweet as I expected though, which is good. Still gave me a sugar high (ok perhaps it was the smores pie) but the chocolate quality is detectable to be better than average. With the smores pie, it is a layer of granola crushed bits, with a huge chunk of chocolate, and molten marshmellows. Super decadent. super sweet.The place itself is very whimsical and nice.

It is perhaps easier to identify their adorably vintage signature car parked outside which is quite hard to miss. I was brought there by a friend who had raved about the place and their waffles.The place was not big but very cosy and comfortable, with quite a nice homely feel to it. We went there in the day but I was told by my friend that it was gorgeous at night with the lights and an open area so I would have to go again to witness it for myself. The staff were extremely pleasant with huge smiles and an ever-ready attitude, which made it a very delightful experience indeed. The happiness of the staff seemed to be rather infectious as it made me feel rather happy too despite the rain outside.I ordered a chicken baked rice which seemed to be more of an eastern take on chicken baked rice, without the creaminess that most baked rice dishes have. In fact, there was no sauce, and it was simply a slightly sweet chicken and mushroom rice, reminiscent of claypot rice, baked with a layer of cheese that was likely some form of cream cheese instead of the usual cheddar or mozarella. Although it was not the best baked rice I've had, it was quite an interesting take on chicken baked rice and went rather well together as a whole. We also had their famous waffles with cinnamon icecream, and though the ice-cream was far too grainy, the waffles were wonderfully fluffy on the outside and crispy on the inside.With the stellar service I received and yummy waffles, I would be more than glad to go back again to verify if it is indeed as lovely as my friend had described at night."

As I live around the area, wimbly lu was probably the closest cafe for me to get a nice cup of coffee and cake. I have heard raving reviews about the place from some friends who have been there a couple of times. My parents were familiar with the area so we found the cafe quite easily. However, I believe it might be pretty difficult for most people to get there by foot as it is located in the private housing estate quite a distance from the nearest MRT station (Serangoon MRT). The cafe is easily identifiable by their signature red car parked outside. The decor of the place is lovely, and great attention is put into the display pieces and ornaments placed around. Walking in, antique looking shelves line the wall, giving the place a touch of vintage. The rustic red bricked wall on one side, coupled with the beautiful lighting gave the place a homely, yet romantic atmosphere. I had their Rootbeer cake, which essentially was a piece of dark chocolate cake infused with root beer, topped with a chocolate root beer syrup and served with vanilla ice-cream. The chocolate cake was alright, and I could taste the hint of root beer with each mouthful. However, the chocolate did not come through sufficiently, which was pretty disappointing as what can be worse in a chocolate cake than not tasting the chocolate. That said, the chocolate syrup was divine. The chocolate was thick, but not too heavy, and the root beer flavour combined with it brilliantly. The vanilla ice-cream was slightly icy, but otherwise went well with the cake. I also had a flat white, which was pretty good!The service at Wimbly Lu was brilliant.

I didn't really know what to expect, actually - I tried to come with tempered expectations in case it didn't actually live up to the hype - but came away liking it quite a bit.it's a small space (so be prepared to wait), but gorgeously furnished in kitschy retrovintage furnishings and what I feel is rather old-school american - which also leads me to ask: have you also noticed that hipster places in singapore take on a vintage persona from history that never quite happened to us? I feel like this place could fit in fantastically in seattle, but here seems a little like an isolated microcosm of american fifties-style coffee shops.and the food? pretty good, really. we had two waffles  - both of which came warm, crisp outside with soft insides. I think this ought to be a sure-order; it's a rather large portion as well. we also had a bread pudding - served with crème anglaise - as well as a still molten chocolate lava cake. I think the latter was more impressive - the chocolate was sufficiently darkwell-worth a return, and especially so after dinner at the fat cat."

It is a mix of teenagers, families with young children and older parents (pioneer generation card holder also has special price) and a handful of adults on Sunday afternoon after 2pm. The staff is young and the service is enthusiastic, polite and prompt. They do try to fit everyone and so a few tables of diners were asked if they could swap tables to accommodate different group sizes. Generally everyone is considerate and fine with that. The cashier is a bit slow, and again everyone is understanding and not in a hurry. The cashier is also mindful of the students and different organizations discount available and will ask if any of us has that. That is quite rare as many restaurants do not even bother asking customers that. This is not a place for a quiet meal as the din from a full house is tremendous. Food is served quickly unless you ordered the baked rice/pasta then it will take a while. The pricing is generally affordable though I think there could be more than 4 mid wings for $3.80. Or maybe the presentation of 4 mid wings in a big bowl makes it look very little. I customized my baked rice with double cheese (regular mozzarella and nacho cheese) with spicy garlic (just a few slices of chili, so not spicy to me) and mushrooms  (sliced button mushrooms). I did not care for nacho cheese in rice so I will skip that next time. The wings are good, likewise for the cream of mushroom (sliced shiitake) soup and garlic bread."

Plus, it comes with a small bowl of chicken rice soup. We ordered the Tofu with Sweet Thai Sauce in addition to the chicken rice; not too bad I must say, the Tofu was soft on the outside and slightly crispy on the outside. I'm not a fan of the sweet thai sauce flavour but it complements the dish nicely.Something interesting to note is that the entire suite of staff from Thai Express was working the floor at Pratunam Chicken Rice. I wonder if it's the same boss or the new bosses took pity on the old staff (given the short notice of takeover) and hired them all.

I think this is a little expensive given their narrow selection of meats - for example, Char-Grill Bar has similar prices, but they offer pork, lamb, beef, etc. By right focusing on only a few meats should help this place cut down on purchasing and storage cost, but I guess that doesn't translate to lower prices.Also, they charge $0.50 for takeaway (not sure why it costs so much, it comes in a plain paper box), and they aren't really very generous with their dips.Overall, the fish and chips may be worth an occasional splurge, i guess."

Even when I'm sick, food doesn't taste so bad (and yes, I used the sauces).So you can come here to eat if you want to feel virtuous. Or feel like torturing yourself.The food was really fresh, but then steaming as a form of cooking is not kind to bad produce - even fans of steamed food would not be able to take it.The sauces you can put on your food to make it more palatable are the standard ones you'd find in any steamboat place, with the addition of black pepper and ""seafood"" (which was a ""Thai""-ish style sweet and sour chili sauce). But then what works with steamboat doesn't work here, since steamboat soup serves to flavour your food (in other words, stronger sauces are needed to make up for the bland-tasting food).Besides the disappointing food, the way this place does dining arrangements makes the experience annoying - you can only cook food one layer at a time, which makes it very slow. The whole experience was thus very slow and we took 1.5 hours to finish our meal. This is probably why they only have 2 dinner seatings - at 6pm and 8pm (good luck to you if you want to eat at other times).One of the few redeeming points here is that as your food is steamed, its drippings fall below to flavour what becomes porridge (which you end your meal with).

I heard from one of the staff that they get their fresh seafood daily and even discard leftovers each day to ensure quality. So what's so interesting about this place? You select the items you want and pick from 1 of the 2 broth for the porridge. They will put the uncooked porridge ingredient in the pot below and tell you to start steaming the other items. The 'juice' from all the items will drip into the porridge making it even tastier. (I think the pork broth is better than the clam broth)That's not all, the steaming process takes just 2 minute for the barramundi (entire fish but sliced up nicely) and up to 6 minute for other items. The plates are color coded according to the time you need to set for the cooking. Steaming helps retain the flavour of each item really well. My favorite dishes are the barramundi, prawn, and the Chef Marinated Minced pork with premium salted fish. This is the current place that will provide you with a unique experience. I heard that you need to book at least 3 days in advance for a table during peak hours. I did a walk in at 8:15 on Friday and was to wait for 20 minute to get a table for 3.

My friend has told me about it ages ago but the location put me off (I'm an Orchard Road girl after all). Then I saw it when I was at the coffee shop for Kim Keat Hokkien Mee, and realized it was not so far from home after all. My favorite type of fish head curry was of the spicy tangy type from my childhood. Not sure where my dad bought it from and my memory was too fuzzy to remember where it was. But it was a Chinese stall specializing in fish head curry somewhere in Serangoon area. Anyway, that is my benchmark for an awesome curry. Ocean Curry Fish Head is very close to that remembered taste. The curry is slightly spicy and has a tang to it. Besides the fish head, there are the usual veg in it (eggplant, tomato and okra) plus chopped green chilies and the surprise - pineapple. For a half head portion, there is plenty of meat that the 2 of us barely finish it. The price is quite ok. We paid $31 for the fish head curry (portion for 2 - half head), a side of vegetables and 1 plate of rice. The stall also has a wide range of dishes for economy rice.

They are afterall famous for their curry fish head.I like the option to have a quick and a affordable meal if you just pick dishes to go with rice on a single plate. Alternatively, you can order dishes and rices in separate dishes. That may be more expensive but more communal as a family meal. Other than the fish curry, the other dishes are also done very nicely. So don't worry and just order what looks good, chances are, it'll taste good too! This is my go-to place for picking up dishes to supplement a home-cooked meal."

I would give credit for the excellent location and fair food, but the bad service more than negated everything. Besides having to pay for something as simple as ice water, they gave us a pile of tissue papers to serve our birthday cake (which was just over 6 inches btw), claiming that they had no more small plates available, full stop. When we requested to borrow their 'reserved' section of the restaurant for just a group picture because it was raining outside and we did not want to disturb the rest of the guests, we were flatly rejected with the claim that the guests might be arriving. We stayed till 10pm, but no one arrived at their 'reserved' section. This was tolerable until our balloons floated to the ceiling and we asked for their kind help to retrieve it. Guess what, their manager just replied and said that they were sorry and there's nothing they can do. As guests, we had to stand ourselves on their chairs and retrieved it with the help of our own umbrellas. Throughout the whole time, all the staff just stood by and watched without offering to help. This is when we decided to speak to the manager, but was told by the staff that there was no manager on duty. Clearly however, there was someone in charge who was in plain clothes. She had stood behind the bar the whole time watching the horrible service unfold with nothing but a smile on her face. When we had requested for their boss's namecard for feedback, she seemed more than happy to pass us the namecard without bothering to find out what the issue was. Horrible experience, all for paid service charge. Thank you Vava Bistro for letting us know how a restaurant should not be managed. I had originally intended to hold my corporate meetings at this establishment, but after this experience, no way would I allow my guests to be served in this manner."

During my visit, I ordered Tom Kha soup (large size) and Thai butter prawn. The thai butter prawn's sauce is really to die for. Taste wise it's not authentic, but the sauce was so creamy buttery and sweet at the same time. Personally I really like it. However the prawn itself doesn't taste fresh to me. I think they probably use frozen prawn. Regardless for $18, you'll get 6 large size prawn. Price wise I think it's reasonable. You get what you pay for.For Tom kha soup, even though the menu only says it's only a lil bit spicy (marked with only 1 sign of chili), but I found the soup very spicy to my taste. This dish doesn't really WOW me or anything, but I'd say not bad. To add steamed jasmine rice is an additional $1.50 per bowl, and Thai iced tea here is  priced at $4. They also have a self-service counter for iced water.Just a side note, this place takes reservation - for no minimum # of people."

That said, our experience is definitely less than grubby. Once you managed to extract some gorgeous cheese strands from the CHEESE PENNE GRATIN ($12 for set with drink), you know this is a pot of gold. Wait no longer, start digging in. Smothered in strong glows of melted cheese and tremendous amount of kidney beans and minced beef, the mushy salted fries have a low chilli consciousness but certainly a helluva better version than the Chilli Corn Carne of Grub. Not sure if the FISH AND CHIPS ($14) might appear the same as the hake fish burger so we had the NAANWICHES. The naan-sandwich fusion weren't bewitchingly delicious but kudos to the team that came up with this ingenious dish.The LIU SHA BAO DONUTS $7 is not exactly in the same league as the classic Salted Egg Yolk in dimsum. Weird and wonderful, there is something extra sexy as you dip the fluffy hot buns into the cool egg dip while watching a couple soaking in the swimming pool as though it was an onsen bath. To be honest, my mind was totally occupied with the desserts right before I even stepped into the cafe. With a beautifully tempered chocolate ganache riding on top some blissfully assertive chocolate mousse, the COCOA BARRY CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE $7 is a highly potent blast of cacao flavour, obscuring the minuscules amount of salted chocolate sables (might have increased by now). The Passionfruit, Mango and Coconut Chiffon Cheesecake $7 did not set my heart on an erratic rhythm, but the finely executed textures in the coconut meringue mousse came as a rare entity in Singapore.  The Rose Pistachio Tart  $6 is aesthetically pleasing but realistically flawed. Crowned with tangy red coulis and mildly scented rose cream, the tart isn't buttery nor crumbly but firm and chewy. The Twice-Baked Sourcream Cheesecake  $7-- a rich baked vanilla cheese with a primary layer of sourcream--was thwarted by it's muggy graham baseBut do get ready you fork before the Butterscotch Arabica Choux $6 arrived before it vanished in seconds. What propelled it to the spot of BEST cream puff in Singapore is the amazing unity of a hyper-delicious salted caramel sauce and rich chocolate filling, cupped in the croustillant-covered choux that is overflowing with pillow-light coffee cream. With enough people clamouring for it, it's magnificence cannot be overstated."

Full disclosure: I haven't been to a public pool since I was a child.Pool was crowded with lots of kids and families and started right next to where we were sitting against the railing. The place was also kinda dark and dull.Coffee was decent. To be clear, friend and I had a serious discussion for 3 hours here so it's not like the noise is so loud but it's just quite messy and school canteen. A bit of contrast to the serious looking coffee machine and huge long counter.We weren't ready for dinner although I saw they had a special for fish and chips for $12, apparently a new item they were trying out. They also had a coffee + cake special for $10 but after looking through all the choices, none of them caught our eye.  Prices for these I thought were reasonable though. The cakes were just a bit weird (or original?) and I read these are all made inhouse. I may go back to try the tikka naanwich sometime as the location is very convenient because there is a huge carpark directly in Home TeamNS so if you're in the Balestier area and need a decent latte and a place to sit and read, this may suit you.

I wanted to go to the stall next door but it was more Italian-Jap fusion (Jap pastas and pizzas) rather than authentic Jap food. We waited around half an hour before being seated on the weekday evening.A glance of the menu and I summarized the dishes to - 1. kurobuta, 2. katsu (fried pork) and 3. sashimi. Not much options here. We both ordered tonkatsu dishes. I had cold soba with it while my friend opted for katsudon.The black pork was really not bad, albeit coming in a small helping. I recommend this if you come here to eat. There was some veges and tomato with the noodles too. I guess I wasn't that hungry so the serving size was perfect.

After settling down in the restaurant and looking at the menu however, I opted for their Yuzu Kosho Mixed Katsu Zen. The deep-fried pork was succulent and the mushroom sauce was delish!

They're also known for their crispy tofu, which is lightly breaded and fried so the middle of the tofu is still soft. Their fish head curry is also worth a try!

Fish head curry - a bit spicy, with more Indian spices rather than Chinese style. The fish is fresh with firm sweet meat. Love the eggplants and okras in it, not overcooked like other places. Nonya crispy tofu - amazingly good. crispy on the outside and silky smooth soft on the inside.Ayam buah keluak - love the slight tart and spicy gravy. chicken could be a bit more tender. buah keluak was good, the opening was quite big so you could dig into the nutty black flesh with your spoon or fork.stuffed you tiao (salad flour roll) - quite normalsweet and sour pork - quite usual toofried eggplant with pork floss - cut into round pieces and deep fried. it was also crispy and crunchy, but being deep fried, a bit too oily for my liking. steamed chicken - tender chicken meat which was very smooth to the tastebakwan kepiting soup - quite tasty, meatball was nothing to write aboutstir-fry sweet potato leaves - fresh and nicely doneYou could choose regular white rice or chicken rice (fragrant) rice.

Then I recalled Nik did tell me that before, likewise for another Yong Tau Foo stall which he reviewed before. Duh. So we decided to head to the market to discover it was closed for cleaning (I never saw Nik's tip until too late - see, this is where Yelp can be really useful if one actually looks through all the tips and photos)Back to this place again where I ordered the wanton noodles. I did not order what Nik ordered so my char siew was thinly sliced and not as succulent looking as Nik's picture. But the wanton noodles was really good. After mixing in the sauce and chili, the noodles became dark and not as pale as in picture. The char siew was nice but could be better if I had ordered the fatty thicker version. The ultimate was the wanton soup. It had a herbal taste (like in duck soup?) which I enjoyed. The wantons were smallish but not too starchy thick. Now I know to order the noodles next time and with the thicker char siew. It is way better than the duck rice which I usually get at the other outlet.

Ordered chicken murtabak to share between my friend and I and teh limau with plum for beverage. The beverage was alright. It would be better if they have put less ice. But it quenched the thirst. The chicken murtabak came pretty bigger in size than what I thought. For $8, there were four pretty reasonable slices of prata with chicken curry inside and there were the thin and crispy pieces on the side. Besides that, they also provided a bowl of curry to pour on to the murtabak if you are up for more spice on your dish. Pretty worth the price.Order came within 15 minutes. Beverage first then food.

The system is (I was told):1. order2. pay3. get a buzzer and receipt5. wait for your drinks first4. find a table, if you have not already5. collect food when you buzzer lit/vibrate.6. bring your receipt in case they get confused on what you orderedThe service was hit and miss because of one server. She got confused when I asked for the tea. All because when I collected my food, I only took the dishes since the drinks were not there. So the buzzer was kept by them, and she either forgot I just brought the food to the table, or she just thought I was trying to pull a fast one on her for the drinks. I had to show my receipt and showed her my table did not have any glasses of teh tarik on it, and even then she still insisted that because I did not have the buzzer (she already kept it when I took the food), she could not give me the drinks. After glancing a few times between the receipt and table, she decided to give me a glass. I said I paid for 2 sets, then she wanted to give me a glass of teh tarik and a glass of something else. It was all resolved when the guy who took my order stepped in. Then he said usually customers would wait for the drinks first, before going to the table and wait for the buzzer to buzz before collecting the food. Since there was no sign or indication when ordering to wait for the drinks, it was easy for confusion to happen. Food wise, the vadai was awesome. Crispy on the outside, doughy chewy soft on the inside, with hint of potatoes. One of the better ones I have tried. The prata kosong was equally good. Also crispy all around. The curry was spicy and went very well. Tandoori was not available during the tea time period."

Chomp Chomp Hai Wei Yuan Seafood BBQ,"#01-01 Chomp Chomp Food Centre 20 Kensington Park Road, Serangoon Singapore 557269 Singapore ",557269,1.36423252476886,103.86652701738,[],Foodie F.,ED2fINQSyg-8WyzI9BCEyw,"Singapore, Singapore",4,10/17/2013,"There are at least three stalls that sells barbecue (BBQ) seafood in Chomp Chomp Food Centre. Of these, I have tried two of the BBQ seafood stalls. And out of these two stalls, there's one which I always prefer to order from. The stall is Chomp Chomp Hai Wei Yuan Seafood BBQ 忠忠海味园BBQ海鲜烧烤 (what a mouthful). I shall call it Hai Wei Yuan to keep it short.Hai Wei Yuan is easy to spot as its at the entrance of Chomp Chomp. In fact, it is located at the left most corner at the entrance and has a unit number #01-01. This stall is fairly popular and you can expect a waiting time of at least 30 minutes (even on a weekday evening). There are tables directly in front of this stall. However, my advice would be to sit elsewhere. This is because the BBQing of the sambal chilli can cause the air around this stall to be very uncomfortable. The seafood such as stingray, crayfish, lala clams, gong gong and cockles were displayed on a bed of ice. We ordered three dishes and two bowls of rice from Hai Wei Yuan . The three dishes were Sambal Kang Kong $8, Sambal Lala $8 and BBQ (Sambal) Stingray $12. The two bowls of rice cost $1. Payment is made only after the food is served. We waited  for around 40 minutes before our food was served (Food for thought: it was a Thursday night. Can't imagine what the waiting time would be if it was a weekend or Friday night).Although the Sambal Kang Kong $8 served on a piece of banana leaf had been highly raved about, I thought that it was average. I had eaten better ones elsewhere. The Kang Kong was well cooked and retained a nice crunchines. However, the dish as a whole was too spicy and was not tasty enough.The Sambal Lala $8 was served on a piece of banana leaf.We thought that the Sambal Lala Clams was unique. The lala clams were normal, but what stood out was the sauce. It had the right balance of spiciness, sweetness and saltiness (due to the lala clams). What made the sauce so unique was that it had this slight peanutish flavour that made it aromatic and addictive. Shiok! We were scrapping whatever sauce there was and adding it onto our rice.The BBQ Stingray $12 was also served on a piece of banana leaf.Needless to say, we always squeeze the lime to up the flavour by a notch or two. The BBQ Stingray was not bad. The sambal chilli spread was spicy and fragrant while the Stingray was tender, soft and more importantly fresh. However, a grouse which I had was that the stingray was too thin - not meaty considering the price. Having said that, credit must be given to the stall owner as he bothered to add slices of onions on top of the BBQ Stingray to enhance the flavour. I polished off the whole stingray (literally) including its skeleton (soft bone) which contains cartilage which is good for the joints.Overall, the food from Hai Wei Yuan was delish. Even though we had to wait so long for the food and the price seems to be on the higher end for a hawker centre, I would still be back. Reason being the prices at the other stalls are the same. In addition, I am a foodie, I am definitely coming back to Chomp Chomp for all the other yummy and sinful food.Detailed review: foodiefc.blogspot.sg/201…"

All their porridge is dried scallop based, which gives it a sea food-y umami test. Very traditional with peanuts and you tiao. The rice is also very full and thick, not the watery stuff you find in hawker centers. The clay pot rice is equally wholesome, with chestnuts, chinese sausages, mushrooms and whatever meat you ordered. The sauce gives it a smoky kick and it's wonderfully fragrant. One pot is generally sufficient for 2 or even 3 people, so don't over order!I would also recommend their fried pumpkin coated with egg custard, it's the same sauce used in salted egg yolk crab but you don't have to deal with crab shells so it's bite after bite of awesomeness. I had one bad experience with their service though, I asked for napkins (which considering that they're a restaurant and charges a premium on their food plus service charge and GST, is a reasonable ask), and they asked us to pay for a tissue packet. I was given paper napkins with no questions asked a previous visit, so it was kind of an annoyance when the waiter insisted that we pay for the a packet of tissue. It kind of irked us that a restaurant charging 13 bucks for a bowl of porridge can be this cheapskate, so -1 star for that. Nevertheless the food is pretty good so give it a try!"

I had the largest $6 portion that gets you more ingredients but the smaller portions will more than suffice. Do note it's not the fastest moving stall.

Located along Upper Serangoon Road, it is roughly a 10-15 minute walk from Serangoon MRT station. There is often a decent crowd at the stall late at night, which is testament to the quality of their prata.Their prata is crisp, yet stretchy, and not too oily. I like their curry which is not too strong on spices, yet very tasty and complements the prata very well. Their murtabak comes in huge portions. Mum and I ordered a $6 portion and had trouble finishing it up. It is packed full of meat and eggs and the prata dough is fried just right. However, the service here is sub-standard. Some of their service staff do not really understand english so you're probably better off pointing off the menu."

They also have 2 portion sizes available for the grouper only.  Regular is SGD $30 and larger size is $32.  I got the regular and it was already plenty big.Curry consistency was good and not too watery.  Heat was also present but not too overwhelming.  Can definitely taste the tanginess from combination of tamarind, tomato, and pineapple within the curry itself.  The snapper itself was very tender and the meat soaked up the curry quite nicely. Appetizing as hell.Noticed that quite a few tables were also ordering crabs here as well.  May well be back for that next time.Minor service issue since I had to keep checking up for my water, but overall a good experience."

We decided on the lala bee hoon instead and opted for my daughter's fave shrimp paste chicken. Taste wise, the bee hoon was flavourful and a pretty large portion for 3-4 people. The yam ring was a tad disappointing as it was dry probably from being pre-cooked earlier. The kai lan and shrimp paste chicken were decent and tasty, so I'll order these again next time together with the lala bee hoon."

Even though I have been acquainted with McDonald's fillet o fish for a longer time, Mos burger's fish burger is by far the best fast food burger I've ever tasted.The reason is simple: its rendition is perfect. The patty is soft, sweet and the grains very fine, the fish is springy and fried to perfection, and the (japanese) mayo is rich, smooth and so very delicious. Put together, this is a winning combination. I'm also a huge fan of the fried garlic and lemon mussels, and find myself always craving more after having the smallest portion (of 5). The iced milk tea also complements the meal perfectly, and the milky taste makes me feel extremely satisfied.I especially like this branch because the seating area is big, and I don't usually have problems looking for seats in this outlet unlike many others. Service is also quick and I like the fact that the food is brought to my table, although the wait can sometimes be pretty painful (reason being the food is only prepared upon ordering, spare perhaps the fries). And you wonder why they say good things are worth waiting for."

It's prepared in an HK way which means plain steamed rice that is topped with some sauce.  But the rice was very wet and not flavorful at all.  The hor fun was also very wet and not flavorful.  The noodles, however, were quite good - good texture, flavorful and soaked up the sauce well.  Overall, it's nice to have a location of Hong Kong Soya Chicken in Toa Payoh, which will spare me a trek down to Chinatown.  But as for their signature chicken rice, it's not my cup of tea."

Anyway, as usual I have never had high expectation on any fast food joint, let alone KFC, although it's much better than McD. So my craving for fried chicken came out of nowhere when I was home and decided to try KFC's delivery service. Ordered chicken nuggets, original rice bucket and popcorn chicken. For a fast food chain, seems like they're doing their job in an above average manner. I'm very impressed about several things:1. They separate their mushroom sauce for the rice bucket to prevent it being soggy on the way so when it finally reached home, I was like MAN they know about all these basic things and 4 thumbs up for this. Also, seems like they gave more chickens for take-away. The rice to chicken ratio is perfect too!2. Actual delivery time is actually much faster than estimated time (like 15 mins faster and hell yea it matters to a starving woman).3. I ordered chicken nuggets for the first time from KFC and they taste DOPE! Like really! So fresh, tasted like real minced chicken breasts and free chipotle bbq dipping sauce! I must say $3.5 delivery cost is totally worth it! Although they do have $12 amount as minimum order charge which is understandable. They also have weekdays promo, and I opted for the $6 for 2 portions of popcorn chicken which is only valid on mondays! Really made my day!"

What is kampong chicken, one might ask? Kampong chicken is the western equivalent of free range chickens. The belief is that compared to cage chickens, kampong chickens have more tender meat due to being able to run around freely. During my meal at Chicken house, I felt that it was pretty much true. Add to that, I find that the drumsticks were slightly bigger than the usual ones one finds in SIngapore. I found the chicken rice and chili sauce so-so, nothing special. I guess the novelty lies in having kampong chicken for a change. The price came up to $13 for half a chicken and a few extra portions of rice.Regarding parking, they have a small sized carpark in front of the restaurant but places are limited and one might have to even park at Thomson plaza and walk over."

Order the chicken liver with it - it is moist but has a really nice pasty texture to it. The ginger and chilli sauce are all very ordinary though.

The third clue that this place is worthy of seeking out: The soup had carrots, old cucumber and goji berries. And when I tried a spoonful, there was the distinct fragrance of dang gui that had been added to the broth. The soya sauce chicken was silky and well marinated. And I love the umami in the sauce drizzled over it. The chilli is also worth a mention: hot but rounded out gently with garlic and vinegar, gently spicy without the harsh bite of some chilli sauces at other stalls. All for the princely sum of $4.50.

A good alternative since my favorite tuskemen is in a little ramen store in some streets of Kyoto and not exactly accessible.They also handmade their gyoza.

Some of my favourites include al funghi, aglio olio, and arrabiata.The ambience is ok, nothing too fancy. But your clothes might smell if you stay for too long."

And the fillings are so substantial that they literally fill you up! The char siew paus are nicely filled with yummy pork meat that's nicely marinated. But the definite must try is their ""kong bak pau"" - marinated pork belly meat in a smooth bun. These are tiny too, like their chair siew pau counterparts. But unlike the normal kong bak paus, instead of a huge slab of meat, the meat in this bun is nicely shredded yet retaining that moist, flavorful fat. Definitely will head back for these mini pop-in-your-mouth pieces of joy! Less flour, more meat, and yet oh-so-fluffy."

Most of the food we get now are often factory made or from a central kitchen. So it is such a treat to be able to savor food which is made the traditional painstaking way. I first tried the char siew bao a few years ago when my colleague gave me one to try. It was tiny but packed with lip-smacking delicious char siew filling. It was not very fatty and had the right ratio of bun and meat. It was 50 cents then. The price has gone up to 60 cents for the bao (small) and $1.20 for the big bao. Some may feel that it is expensive for something which can be devoured in one mouthful or two bites but I think it is quite alright for something which is handmade and tastes so good. The big bao (pork) is not very big compared to other places but I think the size is just nice for a snack or light meal. The meat inside is juicy and the sauce coats the interior of the bao perfectly so you do not get the feeling of dryness at all. Beware the small bao as you may just keep popping them into your mouth as they are just so good. It is definitely better when served fresh off the steamer.

And as the their name states, they are all handmade and started by Mr Yeoh who is Teochew. They also sell fan choy (glutinous char siew rice) and lor mai kai (glutinous chicken rice), which fortunately arent tiny. Prices may feel a little steep, after all for the same 60 cents, you can get a much bigger pau elsewhere. But the novelty and the fact that the paus are actually very yummy makes up for it. Their siew mais are particular yummy because instead of prawns they use fish and instead of crab roe they use carrots. A lot healthier than a standard siew mai but just as tasty.Business is brisk especially the more popular items like the kong bak paus and the lotus paste paus. You can actually call in to pre-order to avoid disappointment.  I've always been proud to be a teochew because teochews are famous for many local food like fried carrot cake, fried kway teow, kway chap, teochew porridge, etc. Although pau isnt exactly exclusively a teochew specialty, it is still a prime example of good teochew made food here in Singapore.Their opening hours are Tuesday to Saturday - 6:00am to 2:00pm and Sunday - 6:00am to 12:00pm."

When I first heard about this place I was skeptical, but it's really pretty good. There's some element of fusion cuisine but you can also get normal korean food.The ""tapas"" are certainly not tapas sized, being more like appetisers.The sweet corn fritters were great. They were of an appropriate size, and didn't taste too much of corn (the corn flavour is actually quite mild). There was also a vague fruit flavour hovering on the edge of my palate.The grilled pork belly salad was simply dressed and came with a generous serving of pork belly, which was excellently char grilled (with plenty of that char grilled edge). I didn't really taste the Yuzu flavour though.The seafood pancake was alright. A little chewy (it could be thinner) and the ingredients weren't well integrated into the batter, but it was still tasty.The value set meal (3-10pm daily) was great value - appetiser (kimchi or pickles), 3 skewers, rice or ramyun ($4 more) and a drink for $10.90. The kimchi was above average. The skewers were all really tasty - they grill really well here.The chewy korean pancake with lotsa things was really nice. Even if the black sesame chantilly was just black sesame paste (it was far from the consistency of whipped cream). The mixture of chewy and crispy pancake, vanilla ice cream, nuts, cinnamon, black sesame and red bean went really well together."

The grains were beautifully cooked; moist but not too clumpy and flavours were as rich and piquant as the colour imparted from tomato and kimchi.All's not lost with the adventurous desserts here. I truly enjoyed the Misugaru lava cake ($8.90++), a nice Korean interpretation of the western lava cake by using Misugaru, a traditional Korean multi-grain powder most likely very new to most Singaporeans. Warm, earthy with a subtle malt fragrance, this was more outstanding and unique than its other matcha lava flavour. Crunchy and chewy, the Hotteok($8.90++), humble korean street pancakes are elevated inordinately with just the right amount of smooth piping hot red bean and peanuts. Savour them when they are fresh and hot with the ice cream."

They will ask if you would like chicken or mutton curry to go with the prata. This is actually an additional order and is not an option for the complimentary curry which usually comes with prata. So just say you want the usual curry if you do not wish to have mutton or chicken curry. The usual curry has a bit of assam which I like as the tangy taste kinda refreshes the taste buds.

It goes without saying that this is a Muslim-oriented joint, so there won't be any pork on the premises - - don't be a wanker and go there asking for it.The Malay dishes are bomb, but I will typically eat no less than two prata kosong with curry in one sitting. I've also had the rojak, and I wasn't wild about it, but it looked very pretty. It's definitely an acquired taste, so maybe I've been away from SG for way too long, as I just can't really enjoy rojak or mee rebus any longer.People might argue with me that there is better prata in SG, but I SERIOUSLY disagree. The prata here are made of magic."

After gaming at a LAN shop nearby, my friends and I dropped by RK house for supper. Surprisingly at 4am, they still had a full menu instead of a reduced menu most restaurants would do during wee hours. I ordered a favorite of mine: nasi goreng ikan bilis (fried rice with anchovies) and a cup of iced milo. The dishes came fast and it was cheap ($3.50). The nasi goreng tasted up to standard and I enjoyed having it. My friends who ordered prata and mee goreng had a decent meal as well. Just remember: Do not ask for non-halal dishes.

As it was so last minute, we weren't sure where we would be eating so we decided to walk down Boat Quay and find something that would be to both our liking. It wasn't even 5 minutes in before we both spotted this and decided to give it a shot.It was practically empty at 1 pm with only one other table seated. Not seeing anyone in sight, we both seated ourselves at the outermost table that was beside the ""water"" and ""the view"" while waiting for a server to appear in the vicinity.Our lone-ranger server eventually appeared like Houdini and handed us a menu each with a gentle smile. He didn't say much and it doesn't require my psychology degree to know that he was a hardworking introvert.So...just like Mexican food (in Singapore...needed to edit this after Bianca J.'s comment), I don't really think much of Singapore when it comes to Persian or anything Mediterranean (maybe Greek has a chance...but even then, I highly doubt it to be mind-blowing). A spoiled brat I may be to this particular cuisine (much thanks to great family friends of such decent in the US) but I'm also having withdrawals for a good 7 months and NEEDING some Mediterranean spice! It's about time to have a hint of these lovely flavors!What comes out as considerably cheap - in Cindy Q.'s words (regarding this area) - were two lunch specials - the fish and the koobideh - that we eventually settled for when our silent server came back to check on us.1. Barley Soup - we started with this soup...and to be honest, it was really weird. It would be the first time I had it in a ""Mediterranean"" setting and I've never had it served at any of my friend's family gatherings. Perhaps, my friends served more popular soups and skipped this one...and for good reason.2. Fish Plate - three pieces of beautiful seasoned and cooked fish over saffron rice, a side of slightly-wilted undressed salad brought to life by the lime provided, roasted tomato and pepper, and garlic mousse. Okay, the salad is dry and wilted...Cindy Q. didn't think too much of it and I'm complaining like a stuck-up rabbit, lol.3. Koobideh Plate - this was the reason I dropped a star. The koobideh wasn't fresh...in fact, I personally think it was sitting for quite a bit as there was a subtle flavor of sourness that is definitely NOT lime or vinegar. Sad...I really wanted this particular dish to shine more.Will be back again to try the others...but only if Cindy Q. is down for another last minute meal, lol. :)Yelp 100: 42/100"

Perfectly grilled skewers of meat, with minimum seasoning that allows the main ingredients to shine. We love our Yakitori and couldn't be happier when we found one that opened late for supper (their last order is 11.30pm). Judging from most midnight Japanese food joints, our expectation wasn't that high, as long as it tasted decent but boy oh boy did this place blow our mind.OmoteNashi Dining Gosso, as the name suggests, specializes in Gosso Yakitori, Chicken Liver wrapped in crepine (a thin layer fat netting) and like many of the dishes, it was mind-blowingly good. Gosso Dama The liver was perfectly grilled and very fresh. The 40 second timer they gave initially felt a little gimmicky (apparently the taste changes after 40 seconds), but I'm not complaining. The liver was juicy, the seasoning well balanced and it didn't have that overpowering frozen / stale liver taste. It's a great way to introduce the non-liver fans to liver. Hatsu (chicken heart) Most places cook the hearts to death, serving a dry, rubbery interpretation but the ones here were heavenly. It's lightly seasoned, allowing the freshness of the heart to come through and grilled to perfection. It wasn't tough or rubbery, instead, offering a nice snap as you bite into it. Definitely the best grilled heart I've ever eaten. Momo (chicken thigh)Another fantastic dish. The teens here is to keep the seasoning light, so no overpowering teriyaki / Yakitori sauce here. Instead, the chicken is slightly salted to help elevate and compliment the sweetness of the chicken. The chicken was grilled to perfection, offering a nice char outside while the inside remained juicy and succulent. Shishamo. My personal favourite. The fish was grilled perfectly, offering a nice, easy to bite, snap to the skin while the inside remained moist and tender. The best Shishamo dish over had..... ever!!Cheese Taukune (cheese stuffed chicken balls)A little inconsistent on the cheese and mind was firmly in the ball while the wife's cheese was squirting out. That said, he mince's mix of 16 (I think) spices, accordingly to the menu, was perfect blended, ensuring that every piece was juicy, tender and very well seasoned.Butamaki Omochi (Rice cake wrapped with Pork Belly)Probably our least favourite of the bunch. I personally felt it needed a tad more seasoning because of the floury nature of the rice cake (it's a lot like a mochi) and the wife isn't a fan of the sticky rice cake. It was still a yummy dish, just not as mind blowing as the rest. Overall, the restaurant is a fantastic place to satisfy your Yakitori cravings. Whether it's sitting by the river or the cozy interior of the restaurant, the food is the star. Oh, and it also helps that the staff are very friendly."

Go for squid ink - I can't tell what's in there but definitely some squid and tasted better than the mixed seafood paella. Can't put my finger on what's missing in the seafood version - the rice is not as flavorful."

Stumbled by this gem along the touristy boat quay from my sister-in-law's recommendations. It was difficult to find as the boat quay shophouses are not numbered, and the sign was a relatively small circle perpendicular to the side walk. An easy tip to find the place is by spotting the cat cafe right above it! The menu is simple and relatively small compared to its other outlet, but has the key elements of a Spanish restaurant - tapas, cured meats, alcohol and paella. We tried the cava sangria as i had not previously seen this anywhere else. Cava is the champagne of Spain, light and bubbly, usually to start off a meal. Sadly, although there was a good amount of fruits in the sangria, the overall taste of the sangria was rather bitter.. maybe from the cava or insufficient juice mixed in? We tried several tapas and the paella: the fried chorizo is a little salty, but still tasty. The olives had a good spicy kick to it. The melted cheese mushroom was good too. My personal favorite was the paella. It had good flavor, lots of seafood and chorizo but was a little salty for my taste. My favorite part of the little Spanish place is the view. The seats by the Singapore river were very breezy and has very good view of the city, including VCH, MBS, city hall, Fullerton. You also get live music from timbre across the river and some other bars further down the shophouses. It was also really nice that it wasn't particularly loud so conversation could be easily carried out. I would definitely be back when in need of a place to chill with some friends!"

We walked in after chancing upon it when we were trying to look for a nice place with Prosecco that we can sit, eat and chill along Circular Road.Service was excellent and the pizza is great! Thin crusted and generous in their toppings and sauce, every bite is rich and full of ingredients and flavour.We ordered the seafood tomato sauce based pasta and we weren't disappointed! To be honest, it was the way the male host was serving his patrons seated at the entrance of the restaurant that got our attention and decided to give it a go. The host was really thoughtful and nice. Together with another hostess, the team kept topping up our flutes with chilled prosecco from the bottled we ordered whenever our glasses were near empty. Their cheerful disposition and keen observation is very much appreciated. Serving rather Classic Italian dishes, I have to say their fried chicken isn't that great. Perhaps the grid calamari would have been better but it would be seafood overload since we already ordered the seafood pizza.The evening ended with a tiramisu and a panna cotta to share. This is probably the better panna cotta around as it was creamy and dense. Not too tough nor too soft, the consistency was just right.The tiramisu is nothing short of ""I want another spoonful please"" again and again. It has a good balance of the complexity of bitterness of the espresso in the cake and the milky sweetness to the cream. The sweetness and bitterness lift the experience with depths of taste instead of the usual overly sweet tiramisu that is usually put up in other places.To top it all up, the host served up a shot of limoncello for each of us on the house. They have won my heart."

I only had a day stop over in Singapore and I was so keen to go there. Based on Singapore's standard, the cat cafe charged quite an expensive price but it was quite understandable because they have to take care of the cat's litters, vaccination and the exorbitant rent cost. Sam, the owner of the cat cafe, always welcomed us and took his time to chat with us. On our latest visit to the cat cafe, he also gave us the dry food sample for our ragdoll cat, Melody.The cafe was very easy to find and it was a 5-10 walk (depending on how fast you walk) from Clarke Quay Central and One Raffles Place. As you walk to the Level 2 of the 54A Boat Quay, you can see cat paintings on the wall. From time to time, Neko No Niwa sold some limited edition items such as paintings of their cat and painted cotton bags. They also have some cute cat collar and I bought one for souvenir purposes. The best time to visit was in the morning before lunch time or late at night before the cafe's closing hour.Neko No Niwa adopted all the abandoned cats, gave them loving human touch and let them heal get closer to human by putting them together with the customers. There are some rules that they put in place as a safeguard for both the cats and human patrons (e.g. do not disturb them when they sleep). Every customer who booked for a certain time period will be given a rule book to be read and they can also order some food or drinks from the cafe section. Each drink ordered will arrive with a wooden lid to ensure that the dust / fur didn't get in it (or maybe so the cat didn't play around with it). On three occasions I went there with hubby and on the last visit I took my friend (Nevertity) who was really scared of cats. In two hours time, she managed to pet some and even let one slept on her lap (I think it was Jia Jia)! The whole experience was very relaxing and I will definitely go back for another visit when I travel to Singapore. Until then, Neko No Niwa!"

We paid S$12/hour for the first hour each and it seemed steep at first, but the drinks themselves were really reasonably priced and delicious! They had 13 cats when we visited and the menu has a small profile on each of the cats so you can 'get to know them'. It was quiet when we arrived and mostly everyone was sleeping, but the cats were extremely friendly. You can pet them to your heart's content and you can tell they are used to all the attention. The location is absolutely adorable. Located on the 2nd floor above Boat Quay, the cafe has a giant window for the cats to look out and they have a gorgeous view of the Marina Bay Sands. Yes, these cats live a more luxurious lifestyle than even I do. There are plenty of couches to relax on and lots of books and board games if the cats aren't enough entertainment for you :)I'd definitely visit again. The atmosphere was relaxing and the workers were incredibly friendly, constantly popping in to dote on the cats and show us things about them. The cafe is also really convenient to the rest of the popular downtown attractions. About a 5 minute walk to Raffles/Long bar for Singapore Slings and then another 15 minutes to the Singapore Flyer/Marina Sands. Not to mention the Boat Quay area that the cafe is located in has TONS of neat looking bars and restaurants. We were at the cafe at 11am, so things were just opening up, but would have loved to spent the evening in Boat Quay along the Singapore River."

Then on too of that every half an hour is at a certain rate (not too sure). You will be removing ur shoes so I recommend slippers or easy to wear kind. Also will be required to wash hands with soap before going in the cats area. As for drinks, their recommendation is ice chocolate and various teas they have. I don't usually like chocolate but Since the waiter said it's not too sweet but slightly on the bitter side ao I gave it a shot and it's not bad!Oh and they don't make drinks or food in that place so mostly pre-made.

This is a completely new concept to me, and of course I am not surprised that these cafes are the norm in Japan. (Seriously, I stand by my belief that the Japanese come up with EVERYTHING.)So excuse me as I excitedly tell you about the awesomeness that is the CAT CAFE!This place is perfect for those who:1) Enjoy cats and other furry four legged friends.2) Are looking for a unique experience in central Boat Quay.3) Love animals but can't own a pet at the moment.It's recommended to make a reservation. I was able to call a day ahead for an appointment at 8 PM on a weekday. I only stayed an hour, but I was surprised at the amount of people who came in around 9 PM (especially since they close at 10 PM.) I guess they are right in assuming that the cats would be active around this time.Before you walk in, you will be quickly briefed on the rules and given a small pamphlet with cute pictures and information on all of the cats. The space where all the cats stay is very clean. Their litter is hidden outside and accessible via a small tunnel that runs behind the small coffee/tea bar. They provide various toys you can use to play with the cats, and of course, you are encouraged to pet them (as long as they aren't sleeping.) Although you're not allowed to pick up the cats, the workers there can handle them and offer to put them on your lap (only if you want to, of course.) I had the opportunity to have Brown Monkey (the cats have silly names) on my lap, but after a minute she ran away because she wanted to play. :(The $12/hour that you pay goes towards taking care of these cats, all of whom were strays and adopted. I see so many strays around Singapore; it'd be awesome if they could have more of these cafes around the island!"

A beautiful dish, but the taste wasn't anything out of this world. So wouldn't say it's a must order, but if you like scotch eggs, then maybe you can give this a try. For mains, I ordered the premium special loin set while my friend ordered the katsudon.The premium loin was a lot oilier than the normal loin, but the meat was so tender it didn't require much chewing. So I liked it once I removed the oily sides, but some might love it if you're a fan of lard. The normal loin in the katsudon was tough in comparison and hard to bite through, for those who prefer their meat to have more texture, the regular would be fine. However I found it too tiring to chew, and would order the premium special anytime instead.They serve the tonkatsu sets with 3 types of salt, which I didn't find a difference in taste for all nor did they explain if there was any difference. All they say was one of the salts is to be squeezed with lemon, so I still would prefer old fashioned grind sesame with tonkatsu sauce from say, tonkichi.Overall quite a nice experience, prices are reasons for meat quality.

I suppose this was Sangak. It was crispy and the sesame seeds gave it a nice flavour.The hummus was not bad. Not the best I've tasted but delectable enough.The set came with a mountain of basmati rice. It seemed plain but had a subtle flavour when I ate it. Perhaps this is the true plain flavour of basmati. It was hard to tell as I usually only find basmati in pilaf or biryani form.The lamb kubideh had a very very strong lamb taste. If you don't like the smell of lamb you should stay away this even further than you normally would. That said, it was tastily seasoned and thick. Somehow it was even crispy.I couldn't identify the medley of spices in the lari chicken (lemon and a hint of chili while not being spicy), but it was definitely very different from that of normal kebabs. It also used real chunks of chicken, rather than the ground meatloaf or mystery meat that some places use.Unlike Turkish kebabs, the meats were served without sauces. Yet, the meal didn't feel dry or flavourless because the meats were very moist and bursting with taste.Eating here was definitely a delicious slice of something on the novel side, even if the air conditioning (if any) was barely working (despite our coming at night).Oh, and one upside of coming here is that they sell alcohol, which most kebab places in Singapore don't."

Fortunately for me, I was early, or really late. Everytime I am there, the food I want is fresh and spicy. Nasi Padang isn't nasi padang without it's spicy, sweet and sour flavors. While the varies are vast, I wish for the prices to decrease. Nevertheless, it is in the heart of CBD area and perhaps one of the best malay treat around. Ask for more sambal and try their achar, you can't go wrong with that along with some curry and begedel. Simply delicious for a hot grumpy day during the week.

I had that, plus petai and sambal goreng. It was considered pricey for an essentially street food ""economy rice"" place. It came to $10 with a lime juice. The BBQ chicken was not that great as the meat was dry and a bit tough. It was not juicy or succulent at all. The sambal goreng and petai were decent. Unless I have a hankering for beef lungs or tripe and those rarer dishes, I will stick to the regular Malay style nasi padang. Nearby is the Golden Shoe car park food court on the 2nd level, and it has reasonably priced food. The nasi padang stalls hardly go beyond $5 for a meat + 2 veg rice meal."

The flavors of most of the dishes were just beautiful and unique, the feel of the restaurant being as if I eating inside the kitchen of a huge restaurant, and the service was kind and generous. Highly recommend.I was caught off guard by this experience as I recently lost much of my intrigue with Michelin Stars in Singapore but found this one to be spot on.Reservations for weekday seatings were very easy via their website which I believe uses Quandoo. We simply made a 7:30 res and took an Uber to the restaurant where we walked into a giant kitchen with only 6-8 tables in the entire dining room. At the time there was only one other seated party of 2, later there was a party of 4.My friend and I ordered the following:1) Pasta with Razor clams - This one is a MUST. WOW.2) Pasta with Uni or Crab - Pass on this one. Get the razor clam one3) Pasta with Barnacles - Unfortunately I misunderstood the waitress. Thought she said the barnacles are prepared by itself, not with another course of pasta. The barnacles were very good but I would suggest you not get it with pasta if you already ordered the razor clams.4) Roasted Pigeon - Best pigeon I've had, not gamey at all. 5) Wild Snapper - Excellent6) Strawberry Cheesecake - Fluffy, light, pink, Instagram worthy7) Their signature dessert (Starts with a G) - Very rich. Nice flavor but the sweetness is a bit much after the first bite.They also provided us a special Italian bread that they fly in every week from Italy.The chef is actually there and serves us himself many of the dishes. I love restaurants like this, very personal. Because the kitchen is right in front of you and in a sense, invades your space, you feel like you are watching a TV show with your food being prepared. It's awesome.The Boat Quay location is wonderful as well but can be hard to find. Keep an eye out for the signage and your Google Maps.Only negative at the moment is the quality of their cocktails if you do visit their rooftop bar. I ordered the bramble which was horribly sweet for a simple bramble (although the blackberry ice sphere was cool). My friend got one of the Sours which tasted awful. We barely drank them and left, hopefully it was a one time thing."

There were some highs and lows, with a bill that doesnt justify a five course meal. The amuse Bouche set the tone with the chefs preference for sweet and savory. It was nice to have a geographical expedition in regional tastes of Italy stretched across a placard. The beef tartine was a delightful, playful twist in cherries. The beef marrow butter and beef itself were draped in cherry smoke, creating this illusion of a buttery cherry pie.The langoustine was another example of sweet and savory. This time, the interplay between cocoa nibs, coconut milk sauce, and fish all leaned heavily upon southeast Asia and nods to Africa. Creamy, sultry, crispy, with the seafood still in the forefront. Although it doesn't feel Italian, it definitely tastes good. If they added sugar, it could be a dessert!The haiddako snapper was a sharp turn towards a more conservative dish. Much more familiarity in the ingredients and presentation. The tomato, pepper, and relish combo felt like a deck of cards fanned out, all creating this image of an olive; A tasty olive none the less! The fish stood its ground among the flavors, especially with some help from the caviar. The uni crab pasta dish was boring. For what had the most expensive items on the menu didn't match to taste. The pasta wasn't al dente, the crab barely stood out, and the uni didn't sing. A misstep for sure with the pacing of this meal. The wagyu beef wasn't breaking barriers in presentation, but damn do the classics sound good when played right. The yolk was essential to the meal. It was the goo of life that brought these inanimate pieces of food to life in my mouth. The mustard and black garlic were placed on the outside of the plate like an art palate for me to brush my meat into. The meat itself was butter soft, juicy, and full of beef flavor. The only real enhancement could have been a crust on the outside. The white chocolate Was a fruity dish in disguise. Even though the ball of white chocolate is the main attraction, it was a fairly blank, buttery canvas to push the raspberries straight to the forefront. Plenty of low tone tartness to go around.I liked my meal, but I wasnt delighted like I normally am from a michelin starred restaurant. I have nothing against this talented chef, but I dont think this place was as progressive as it claims."

If Braci were larger (and demonstrate it could achieve the same quality with scale), it would have two Michelin stars, not one. That said, although the dishes are innovative, beautifully plated and refined, the nearby Osteria Art (also owned by chef Beppe) serves more hearty Italian meals (especially the pastas, which are the best in Singapore!)

We started the meal with ""popcorn"" (meat balls with fried minced beef), smoked carpaccio (which included roe and shiso leaves), and then progress towards the slider the cups and the bun - each had fantastic twists which really elevated the dish (for example the cups were prepared with cream of sea urchin to contrast with the beef).

It was only after I had ordered it that I realised that it was going to be a proper vindaloo, and sure enough, as soon as I took a bite my mouth was on fire. Now that is what I call a good vindaloo. Anyway, this is probably not the cheapest place for good Indian, but then again it is located on the Boat Quay, and simply sitting outside on the river's edge, eating a vindaloo (even though it is hot) certainly gives this place a value for money.

He found our tale of woe and misdemeanour hilarious and amusing and deemed our prodigal return a clear act of good faith.

The place looks really nice and inviting from the outside and the staff were also very friendly when we entered. They have a nice and interesting cocktail menu where i found a lot of cocktails i wanted to try. They also offer some beer and wine but that is more limited so clear it is not the focus. The cocktails we had have all been decent but in Singapore there are just so many good quality cocktail bars so this does not really reach the top level. That is not saying it was bad but when I pay well above 20++ SGD per cocktail I expect a very good level. The food here is nice but in general I seldom find myself ecstatic over Latin American food but the small snacks we had were nice. The best thing about this place is however the staff and the ambiance. Staff were attentive and friendly and I liked the feel of the place so I will most likely be back.

We tried both the vegetarian and lamb ones. They didn't t taste as good as they sounded, but they were the best dishes we had.The Cubano sandwich was mostly cabbage and didn't have much meat. Furthermore, the purple cabbage was a little bitter so it wasn't very nice, though the sandwich tasted promising  and would probably be good with more meat.The cassava chips were thick cut. All other times I've had cassava it's been thin and crispy - and I saw why. The chips had an interesting taste, with a clearer cassava flavour than you get with thin cuts, but they was a little dry and dense.The chicken skewers were seasoned with coconut, pecans and lime. An interesting combination, but not one that penetrated far into the meat. So though tender enough, the skewers didn't have much of a taste.The worst item was the dessert: apple and rum layered cake with walnut and condensed milk ice cream. The cake was one of the drier cakes I've had, with a nice crispy texture and a promising taste, but the dryness meant the flavour didn't come out. As for the ice cream. (which was probably dulce de leche)... While it tasted okay, if a little too sweet (and this is coming from someone with  a sweet tooth), the texture was awful. It was like lumpy custard in parts and like cake (yes, really) in others. I've never had ice cream with such a... particular texture before.The service was quite friendly and they do a cute thing of writing your name and reservation time with chalk on the tables, but that couldn't make up for the disappointing food."

Convenient if you work nearby.Tried the BBQ stingray and egg with rice. The fish is fresh and the egg nicely fried. The chilli is nice but the taste doesn't get into the fish. I guess it is just coated in top of the fish after the fish is cooked. It gets really busy at peak lunch hour though. So come early or late.

It's sweet, it's sour and it's crispy! If you want Stingray yet not too sure about whether you can take the spiciness, ask them to have the gravy on the side so that you can dip however much you want, based on your own preference.Crowded during lunch so for an enjoyable meal, try dinner instead. For those who are particular about smelling like BBQ meat after a meal, take the seats outside instead of within the shop. :)"

Chewy and provide a good bite to start the meal. The sea cucumber is not spicy although it does look the look, flavour tends to be bland like typical teochew dishes. My surprise is the pork jelly. Made from bits of the pig head, probably chips of ears and cheek, boiled to jelly and cooled to blocks of jelly and sliced. A teochew delicacy for those with acquired taste. I like the fritters; deep fried liver wrapped in soya skin, and the prawn fritters. They are probably the strongest in terms of taste.The cabbage is delightful, and washes down the bowl of rice. Strands of hair-like fungus, lumpy soya dough and mushrooms made this dish too common; a lack of expensive ingredient type of dish.Dessert of yam and pumpkin is lovely, and sweet water chestnut is refreshing."

They were rather generous and let us try a couple of items.1) mutton wrap with masala fries. Oh wow. I liked the mutton - very flavorful! It had a spicy ending note which surprised me. It felt a bit like a salami because the mutton was rolled up. That's not to say it wasn't tasty cos it certainly was! The fiery masala fries were massively addictive. I couldn't stop reaching for them. 2) Pepper Chicken Tikka - now, my absolute FAVE of the night. It was very flavorful and not dry at all. It's likely to do with the fact that their meats are all smoked on a charcoal fried tandoor. Now, that is one of sealing the juices in so the meats are well cooked both in and out, and still retaining its natural flavors. Just beware. It is spicy but I love it. 3) fish tikka - another dish I enjoyed. Fish rubbed with spices. What more can I say? Get it. 4) achari chicken - it wasn't bad at all; in fact, it was good too, but just wasn't outstanding. I think its spicier cousins took centerstage. Perfect for those who don't like their chicken too stinging. And on to their beers. There will be the urge to get the Fucking Hell beer. (Yes it's a place in Germany). Cos of its name. Whilst good, resist it and get the awesome IPA. Honestly, I think I would go back JUST for the IPA. HahahahahaWith friendly staff, there's little to dislike about Roll Up. Its prices aren't the cheapest around, but I think it makes up for the fantastic food."

Upon sitting, we were told we could only choose between a Tiger beer, house white wine, or soft drink.They then delivered us a plate of peanuts and ever mentioned that you actually paid for the peanuts. Then when we ordered our drink and appetizer, we tried to get the guy to go away and let us look at the menu. He wouldn't leave. Instead, he continued to pressure us to order the crab. So finally, we did. Thank goodness we only ordered one crab. The prices were so ambiguous and were hard to understand and we were never given even just a moment to try and understand it all. When we got our bill, we understood why! We were charged $208 per kg, and supposedly we ordered 1.7kg (or 4 lbs of crab). Maybe with the shell it would have been .5 kg but there is no way that we had that much! And we sure as hell would not have ordered the crab if it was even over $40 per kg!!!This restaurant obviously makes it's money off of one time guests who are severely overcharged to such a point of shock and disbelief.

Perhaps they have gone overboard with their marketing of their ""inner"" beauty? For those who are intimidated by the alternative cuts and random parts, your fears are unfounded. Chef-Owner Jean-Philippe Patruno aka JP, previously of Bomba Paella Bar and Una, fires up more than just the grey matter. Classic Spanish dishes are available here and he's more than adept at delivering them. I let my weakness for Croquetas (4 pcs, $14) take over and swooned in bliss as I bit into the creamy filling encased in the crunchy panko crust. This is one smooth morsel! Make sure you give it a good chew together with the spiced paprika aioli and jamón joselito. I struggled with my need to finish this and saving space for my main meal. That should ease you into starters. If you don't go into the nitty gritty, the Dehesa platter of cold meats ($32), is what you would likely order at any other restaurant- a rotating homemade charcuterie consisting pate, lardo, deep-fried pork scratchings. We all know where the ingredients are from, we don't need to be told/reminded, other than how good they taste. Well if that doesn't go down well, take a few bites of the smoky Pimientos De Padron ($14). They will sure cleanse the palate of any gamey leftovers. If you're not for the cold platters, have the Chorizo ($24) which is served with soft cooked eggs and a smoked mash, and pork crackling! This comfort food combination never fails. If only I could find some bread to go with this.The Dehesa Octopus ($28) was one of my favorites! The tentacles were tantalizingly tender and well seasoned. They are served on a bed of crushed creamy potatoes with some sour bits (I couldn't figure out they were pickles). A thin slice of lardo (cured lard) tops the dish and is torched upon service. This provided a salty smoky note to the dish. Too good!!From the Specials menu, we had the Figateddu Pork Sausage ($17) which is made with blood and liver.  We were warned of the strong flavors but I was more  shocked by the how salty my dish was. The liver and blood part was a walk in the park really. It was tasty no doubt, especially that crunchy potato galette which is like a deep-fried Kouign Amann! To balance the saltiness, have one of the vegetable dishes. We had the light tasting Beets ($24) which featured a round of fresh burrata with pickled beetroot and toasted walnuts. Mild it was, but we needed to calm our tongues before moving on. Another highlight of our dinner was the Squid Ink Arroz ($28 serves 2). The short grain Cebolla rice has absorbed all the lovely seafood flavors and then topped with an umami-rich seafood sauce. Superb seafood on that lightly spiced black rice btw.From the Specials Menu, we also had the Braised Beef Cheeks ($36) with an Oloroso glaze. The meat was well flavored by the red wine and had a gelatinous texture to it. We also had the Bone Marrow ($34) served with sea salt. Well i absolutely don't get the appeal of bone marrow. It's tasteless! Anyway, the one at Dehesa was bland and oily for me. Perhaps it has to do with the way it's prepared. If the bone were sliced into halves, the fatty collagen would be flavored more easily. Instead of the bone marrow, i'd go with the Crispy Suckling Pig ($65 quarter/115 half/199 whole pig) next time. Try it and let me know! For the whole pig, make sure you place your order beforehand.For desserts, we had the Melon Sorbet ($14) which was spiked with negroni! This is made in house by Chef daily and i liked that it wasn't too sweet. Dehesa also has a Daily Tart on the menu and it was Apple Tart ($12) when we visited. The soft caramelized apples were almost jam-like and i enjoyed the tartness of the fruit. We were pretty sure there's some alcohol in this! Please go visit Dehesa if you want a good Spanish meal! I'm not paid to say good things about them but i really feel that they are super underrated. There's no need to be intimidated by the nose-to-tail concept really, Dehesa is that and more."

I order the following:1) Jamon Croquettas - SO GOOD!! Much better than the other Spanish restaurants I've had in Singapore.2) Pulled Pork Sandwich - Best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had in my life. They also give homemade potato crisps with this which is also on point.3) Pandan Ice Cream - Pandan Ice Cream at a Spanish restaurant? What?

Came back again this past Thursday evening for dinner and thought I should write a review since there was only one previous review.The food is very solid Spanish cooking. Chef Jean-Philippe is a very gracious host. Started the evening with several Spanish white wines: - Gewurztraminer, light floral with dry finish, very different than most I have drank. - Sauvignon Blanc, lighter finish than most Sauvignon Blanc if you are used to New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs.- Chardonnay, never had a Spanish Chardonnay before. I think this may be un-oaked. Definitely my favorite of the evening.Appetizers:- Pimentos De Padrones: blistered peppers, very similar to Charred/Blistered Shishito peppers which is what I am most used to. 4/5- Jamon Joselito: not much I can say since the Jason speaks for itself. 5/5- toasted bread with Aioli (not sure of the name of the dish since I do not think it was on the menu) 4/5- toasted bread with anchovies: love this dish since anchovies on anything makes it taste better. 5/5Jason Croquettas: very good croquettes served with Aioli. 5/5- Gambas Ajillo: everyone loved this dish so much we ordered seconds. The bread served with it was good for soaking up the delicious garlicky sauce. 5/5- octopus topped with lardo: the lardo was thinly sliced and flame torched. Very unusual dish. 4/5- crab Paella (not on the menu): Chef JP made this for us and was delicious! Nice Socarrat (the crusty rice at the bottom of the pan) which is a good sign that this is a good paella. And it was. The crabs were cut in half which makes eating it much easier. 5/5Pork skin tagliatelle: This was a special on the blackboard. It is pork skin that has been steamed and sliced to be like pasta and tossed with a ragu of some kind. It was okay, seemed like a lot of work to make something look and have the texture of pasta. 3/5- Cotes De Boeuf: the beef was nicely cooked medium and served with thick fries. By now we were very full after so many dishes. 4/5- radish/pear/pomegranate salad: this was our only vegetable dish. 4/5Deserts were definitely the chef's strong points. We shared 3 deserts off the menu: - torijas/plum/Creme fraiche. This was French toast that I believe was stuffed with mascarpone. Served with sliced plums and crime fraiche. 5/5- Laredo flan/ caramelized pancetta. Excellent! 5/5- chocolat/olive oil/salt: This was chef JP's signature desert. On yelp you will find several pictures of this desert. 5/5Service was excellent and food nicely paced. Highly recommended Spanish restaurant in Singapore."

We were immediately seated right on the water, which provided a great backdrop for our dinner.The menu was full of delicious looking options and we had a hard time settling on a few.

Have been going here on and off for the last few years. Always consistently good, with great service. While the long walk along Boat Quay involves running the ""gauntlet"" of people enticing you into their restaurants with free beer, the Maharajah is one of the few that does not do this. Instead they rely on word of mouth with great friendly service. Probable more in tune with what people from the UK view as Indian food, the Maharajah loses out in the authenticity stakes among the locals, but don't let that stop you from going. The menu is more North Indian and without exception is excellent quality. The ""heat"" levels are fine unless you decide to challenge the chef when ordering. Wonderful service, good value for boat Quay, great ambience outdoors with the cool breeze from the river and we liked it so much we had our reception there when we got married."

Good buzz, attentive & amiable servers. They highly recommended their pizzas, but we decided to go for the widely photographed/publicized Boston Lobster tagliatelle for sharing. It was as good as expected, fresh juicy lobster, paired with homemade pasta - left us stuffed. The calamari appetizer was excellent with the aioli, but slightly pricey for the serving. Seafood was very fresh though. Tried the ricotta castagnole too - would highly recommend, but do share with a bigger group. It does get a bit too heavy for just 2 people. However the little fried dough balls were glorious dipped in the alcoholic custard, complete with a burst of salty sweet ricotta in the middle. Bill came up to ~$140 for 2 for the above 3 dishes, without drinks. Will return to try their other dishes!"

It climbed across my lap and of course, I yelled and jumped out of my seat. We got moved out into the alfresco dining area while they sort out the cockroach issue. You would think that since there's a cockroach scare, they will replace our food with a new set, but no... They just brought out the sets on the table. We got tired of waiting this we just dug into the food, thank God we didn't get any food poisoning. Please note, while the above is happening, we were still waiting for the 2 remaining sets of food to be served. We were 3/4 into our food and the 2 sets were still not served yet.Finally after checking in a few times, then the food finally arrived. After all the ordeal, the recovery was a $10 off the entire meal and many apologies.I feel sorry for the staff cos I don't think they give bad service as individuals, but the experience overall was extremely terrible!!

The meat portions here are pretty small, so each serving is good for 2 people if you order other food too.Spicy marinated chicken - OK.... but I'm not a fan of BBQ chicken usually.Red wine marinated pork belly - This was pretty good. You can taste a little of the red wine marinade.Pork shoulder butt - No idea if this is a mis-spelling or mis-translation. It was a little fatty so I'm guessing its the pork shoulder? Haha. This was pretty good, especially if it is a little burnt and crispy ;)Cold noodles - Yummy! Came with lots of veggie too ;)Kimchi pancake - this was huge and way too much for 7 people to share. Nonetheless, it was really good.Seafood bean paste soup - Yummy. We ordered the small size, but was too stuffed by the end of dinner to finish this.They give you free flow of egg which they use to fill the BBQ grill plate at the side so you get grilled eggs (like the Japanese Tamago egg). Super yums.The bill came up to be about $20 per person which really isnt too expensive considering how much food we had. Definitely one of the better Korean BBQ around!"

One bite of the lamb and I swear it's better than the steak. One bite of the steak, and I swear it's better than the lamb. I really can't make up my mind which was is better so you must order both! Here's the crazy part--the lamb is actually more lean than the beef! This is because Wakauni cures their beef for 40 days so all the meat stays nice, juicy, and fatty! Sounds a bit weird, but fatty steak is a good steak! And I'm talking about the good kind of fat here not the cheap kind found in a dingy Chinese restaurant.  A bit of meat and a bit of steak, simply heaven! The combo MELTS in your mouth. The sides are delicious as well and complements the meat. Mixed vegetables includes different kinds of charred veggies and the mushrooms are grilled with rosemary!

The potato puree was decent, the grilled vegetables, done as they should be.The Camembert on the cheese platter tasted like no Camembert I've ever had, and I mean that in as bad a way as possible.

Nice, but nothing special The salmon starters were a bit too salty, and nothing fancy, and the seabass main was.....fresh. Nothing great, really.The dessert was a chocolate mousse that was essentially a huge kit kat Bar. That was nice! Not too sweet and not to chocolaty.Overall, I'm not impressed. It was average, but then again, I've been to some pretty spectacular steakhouses on a regular basis....and have eaten steak.As mentioned, our mains arrived around 45 minutes after our starters were served, after which my appetite died by then, so the overall experience was just average."

I had the usual ramen before and while it was good, the dry noodle topped it. I ordered the Nagoya style maze soba and it came with plenty of spring onions, seaweed, minced meat and a half boiled egg. The sauce was spicy and tasty. Add the fried garlic (available on the table) for another dimension to the taste. I felt like I was eating a Japanese version of Singapore bak chor mee (minced meat noodle). The yolk broke and coated the noodles with the gooey goodness. I was not sure if that also made the meal even more filling as I was full 3/4 into the noodles. I only wished the egg was not cold. A tiny bowl of soup (rich pork broth) accompanied the dry noodle. I would order this again.The chicken karaage was also good, based on my previous visits. Note:Lunch time ordering is different from dinner. During lunch period, place your order at the cashier and make payment first. It makes sense as you will save time since you can just eat and go, instead of wasting precious minutes waiting for the bill. I believe there is seating available on the 2nd level during lunch time."

It was not as flavourful as I would like it to be, hence the 3 stars. The soup was still very savoury to me, that was for sure, a plus point in a ramen. However, there is definitely room for improvement for the chicken char siew. The waiting time was quite long. There was a shelf of manga to entertain yourself if you would like to browse. Another good point, that is it opens til 11pm. You know how bummed you are if you want to have some soupy ramen after drinks around the vicinity and everywhere has last order at 9.30pm."

Some are really super delicious.Time now has come for us to visit and try Ramen Bar Suzuki's ramen, it was our first time. I'm excited and curious about the taste as I have read some good reviews about it. Reading all the reviews, it sounded to me as if it will overthrow my number 1 ranked ramen somewhere in Tanjong Pagar :) There was no queue at that time as we went there just about a few minutes after they've open. We ordered tonkotso ramen, our favorite broth.The ramen was then served, and this is my honest opinion; Presentation is fair. The aroma is not that intense. The ramen is not served hot enough. I stirred the noodles then took a first sip... The broth is definitely not so rich and not so creamy. The broth is a bit bland (I'm sorry).I hate overcooked and soggy noodles, but their noodles, though I chose ""normal"" texture, is way way undercooked. Anyhow, I dove in but I wasn't able to finish the broth. Overall, we're not satisfied with the ramen. The ramen we just tasted at that particular day and time was definitely not as per our expectations. Was it because they've just opened and the ramen was not yet ready for order?  Shouldn't be the case right? I don't know.Anyways, maybe I'll try it again next time and re-update my reviews."

RBS specialises in Tonkatsu ramen, with choices of white (original), red (spicy), black (squid ink), tsukemen (dipping noodles) or fish flakes. I opted for the white, and aside from the customisation available - taste, flavoured oil, noodle hardness etc, you can also partake in the hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts available. Hm, isn't that quite similar to a certain ramen place at Orchid Hotel, your though bubble visualises. Yes, but RBS manages to one up them by providing jugs of iced tea, fried pork lard and fragrant garlic chips at each table! That's pretty ingenious I think! And in addition, there's complimentary free flow of rice and shredded cabbage with homemade dressing to go with your remaining soup too, which makes this joint even more of a win.Taste test: I went with the white Tonkotsu and the soup base was thick and flavourful without being too oily as most ramen places are wont to do. Sure, a lighter touch is very much tweaked to Singaporean tastes, but hey, that's how I like it. The noodles are on the thin side, so I chose to have them hard (they also have a ""harder"" option) as I was pretty sure they'd get soggy in no time. And they did, so I'll opt for harder on my next visit. The char siew slice was thin, and I was a bit disappointed at that, but it was deliciously tender. What a crafty ploy to get customers to opt for the extra char siew version, but then again, it works! Extra char siew next visit it is. In addition, they also put in a kicker of a really cute Japanese chef - great eye candy and he's got the girls' votes. Er. Have I mentioned that I'll be going back?"

They also have the set ones if you would like. To satisfy both East Asian cravings, they also serve some Korean food items on their menu. The environment to dine in is also very nice.

I believe it's more North Indian fare but man, everything was delicious and well prepared. They did not skimp on the quality of the food. Ingredients tasted fresh and each dish carefully prepared.When you sit down they take your drink order (additional charge) and bring you a basket of the chewiest, warm, buttery plain naan ever. I could have filled up on them bad boys. I believe the naan is also free flow although one basket was more than enough for us.Highlights include the saffron rice, tandoori chicken, aloo gobi, daal, hmm I'm just listing everything I had.They also have a nice dessert section with fresh fruit and galub jamun. This was some good gj - not overpoweringly sweet, just warm enough and the right sponginess.The place was not busy when we came and the service was very attentive - removing used plates and refilling our drinks.Can't wait to find another excuse to come back to Riverwalk Tandoor!"

Suffice it to say that it didn't attain the full depth of flavour that Indian food capable of - the flavours were not intense or rich enough. Perhaps it was the food being served buffet style that caused the quality to suffer a bit Naan was served to the table (i.e. not taken off the buffet line). Yet the first round (presumably garlic) it was neither fresh nor warm and consequently was a little dry. The second round (presumably butter) was better and it was warm, and some liquid (which I presumed was butter) could be seen pooling.The vegetarian dishes were better than the non vegetarian ones actually. Perhaps because the meat wasn't good quality.The desserts were probably the best part of the experience.The gulab jamun was great. Usually gulab jamun is very nua (soft), probably because it's been floating in the syrup for ages. Here it was quite fresh and I could tell it'd been fried recently. It was also quite firm, and though it was rather sweet I could taste something other than sugar.The rice kheer was tasty too. It wasn't too sweet and I could taste the nuts and spices.All in all, this place is quite affordable, especially given the location and the food is passable. But if you're looking for good grub you should go elsewhere.Service here was good. Our water was refilled often and every time I came back from the buffet line (which was really near) my old plate had been cleared."

They have an ala carte menu as well as the buffet. I highly recommend going for the buffet because it's less than $13.90 for lunch and $17.90 for dinner. Where else can you get an awesome Indian buffet spread for that price? Best part about it is you get free flow of naan to accompany all the lovely dishes. If naan is not your thing (though I don't see how that is possible), they also have both white and briyani rice.My first time here was part of a celebratory lunch with a few friends. We didn't make a reservation but that was no problem. They have a decent variety of drinks available on top of the charge for the buffet but I would recommend just sticking to water considering the richness of the food available.So they have a very good spread of both meat and vegetarian curries. I'm not much of a fish curry fan but theirs is really good. The fish meat itself was not soft but firm and the whole thing didn't have that seafood smell you find in a lot of similar dishes elsewhere. Ironically though, their tandoori chicken is a little dry. I don't really mind it though because it's still pretty yummy but if you like your chicken juicy, this might not be something you'd keep going back to the spread for. Apart from these dishes, there's also a small spread of various Indian desserts. There's a tendency for Indian desserts to be very sweet but the ones here just nice. Not too sweet but just enough to finish off the meal. The manga sago is a personal favourite.The fact that the food is delicious is enough to make me a fan of this place but another thing I really like is that the service from the staff is really great! Waiters are very attentive to refilling your naan basket, water glass and even clearing your plate once you're done. Overall, they seem to have gotten the combo of cheap food plus good food plus good staff right on spot. Definitely a place you'd want to not only try out but return to."

And then give me something fairly bland. If they include any spice at all, they check back with me frequently as I sit there crying like a baby and saying ""everything's delicious."" Well--this place was presented to me as the least spicy of Indian restaurants. It was SO SPICY. My friends said I turned bright red the moment I began eating. We did the buffet. And they, and the waitstaff kept trying to suggest I eat this or that to cool down, even when I thought I was fine. The dessert maybe had flies on it. Lots of them flying or swimming--that's really my only criticism, but that's just me being a weenie of an American.But I was nervous about eating in Singapore anyway, because my belly isn't so adventurous.

Managed to snag a table for dim sum on Saturday noon. We were lucky to get a table despite the last minute reservation.Century Egg and Shredded Pork Porridge is one of my standard dimsum order. Nice gluey texture of the congee with generous amount of pork. 4 of us shared a portion in order to make space for more food.Shanghai Xiao Long Bao, Har Gao (Steamed Prawn Dumplings), and Spare Ribs in garlic and chili. All great dishes. The Xiao Long Bao skin was sufficiently thin and encased the juicy pork meat in a robust broth. Har Gao was big, fresh and juicy (i can never resist prawns). The ribs were well marinated and flavorful as well. Mouth Restaurant also offers Colored Har Gao instead of the typical Colored Xiao Long Bao and they are Squid Ink, Spinach, Sweet Potato, Pumpkin, Carrot and Original. The Pan Fried Carrot Cake (another of my favorite dim sum item) was nicely browned and lightly crisp on the outside. The springy texture is just what i look for in a good carrot cake. Oh and the delicious strips of turnip and preserved Chinese sausages (lup cheong) had me finish most of this myself.The Steamed Rice Roll with Fresh Prawn aka Cheong Fun was alright. It's not that they weren't good, the skin was silky but perhaps thicker than what i prefer. Prawns were great as usual but the sauce was a little bland in my opinion. Now now, the reason why we went to Mouth Restaurant. Here's the baked Salted Egg Yolk Bun (3pcs per set) Mind you, they run out fast. Just look at that lovely Hong Kong Bo Lo crust made from sugar, butter and milk powder. It's hard to believe that this is baked because the crust is so crunchy.Be careful how you bite into the bun. Be warned that the piping viscous, creamy, savory and sweet lava may just erupt in your mouth and potentially over your plate, and shirt, and your fellow diners' shirts. It may be a little on the greasy end but the flavor was spot on.Head on to Mouth Restaurant for a classic dim sum fix this weekend! Forgot the prices but it was about S$75 for 4 pax."

The Family went to its newly opened branch at Plaza Singapura during a weekend high tea session from 3-5pm but sadly, many items like the squid ink bun and their signature Xiao long Bao were not available. The Rainbow Har Gao in 6 ($9.80)  mimics the concept of multi-flavor Xiao long was not distinctive as its pork counterpart in XLB. Do not mistaken this Squid Ink Seafood Soup 7.80 for herbal jelly. The base is a egg white custard, topped with a thick soup that is rich and tasty.The best thing I can remember is their Baked salted Egg Yolk (3 for $5) Unlike typical steamed bun, the mildly sweetened outer crust is crisp like a HK-style Bo Lo Bun, that released viscous and creamy golden lava. Though some might find it to be much more greasy than usual kind, but who will say no to custard buns?:)The Sweet Potato Roll $3.60 and Tako Cheese Croquette $4.80 sounded special but turned out to be dry, starchy and pedestrian. Some of the mandatory dimsum items included the chicken claws w chilli $3.90 and the Spare ribs with pumpkin $4.50 and the Fried Beancurd skin roll $ 3.20.  Instead of the usual Chee cheong fun, we ordered the XO-style Pan Fried version Bao. The skin was of the right thickness but the individual flavor of shrimp meat with prawn and charshu $8.80. It turned out to resemble stir-fried kway teow. I like the slightly browned surface of the rice rolls that makes this dish fragrant but the taste of XO-sauce was not amplified.  Conclusion: Higher chances of securing popular dim sum items if we were to come in the morning. Would be more keen to revisit for their revamped ala carte dishes, which were in our memories, more delicious than the dim sum. Some items are creative but their quality vary. Hopefully my favourite egg tarts that were nowhere to be found, can appear on their dimsum menu one day......"

Rather than the more traditional push-cart type of dim sum, you simply check off the items you want on a paper menu and hand it to the waiter. There's even a column to differentiate your first and second orders - a knowing nod to Singaporeans who love to gorge themselves on repeat orders like yours truly. I felt that the average price of $5 for each dish was justified, even the modern ambience and quality of the food. On a Sunday afternoon, the restuarant was packed - I highly recommend booking in advance. Highlights include the har gao - delicately steamed without a thick skin - as well as the pan fried carrot cake - which was not too oily and fried to the right amount of crispiness. Both the prawn and char siew chee cheong fun were also great, with just the right amount of sauce. The shui jin bao (too thick and starchy) as well as the fried chee cheong fun (just a fancy name for char kway teow) could have been better, though. We also felt that ""signature award-winning"" dishes were slightly overpriced, but what took the cake was definitely the ""liu sha bao"", or salted egg buns. These were served piping hot, and the steamed buns split open to a melted yolky centre - like liquid gold. Desserts are nothing special, though. In place of the recommended mango pudding (Crystal Jade serves better), we decided to have another round of the salted egg buns!"

We heard that they are doing some remodeling and adding some partition to make a semi private room area, so that could be a great setting for a more private meal.The menu was pretty extensive, and I was spoilt for choice. I decided to go with a Sashimi set meal ($38). 1. The set meal started with a side salad with wafu dressing. I'm typically not a fan of wafu dressing, so this was just okay for me. 2. Pitan tofu (egg tofu with century egg, crab stick and fish roe topping) - Apparently, the egg tofu is  home made and there are some secret ingredients in the century egg sauce. I've a weakness for pitan tofu so this was definitely a bonus surprise for me :)3. Sashimi platter - comprising of hamachi, salmon, scallop, dancing prawn, fish roe. Hmm, the sashimi was definitely very very fresh, and I love the sweetness of the shrimp :) The scallops though, were a little overseared imho, so it was pretty cooked leaving only a very small raw part in the center. The fish roe was definitely a nice addition and we were advised to eat it without any sauce :)4. Tempura - Wow, I definitely wasnt expecting tempura in the set meal. I like that the batter wasnt too thick. Despite being freshly fried, the tempura wasnt oily, and was rather light in flavor. Yummy :)5. Cold udon - Apparently, they were using a different type of noodle that is thinner and smoother compared to udon and I liked it alot. Sonya mentioned the name of it, but it has slipped my mind now :(6. Spicy tuna roll - I was super stuffed by this point that I was shocked that there was more. The spicy tuna roll was good, and I could taste the freshness of the tuna despite the spice. However, I did feel that it was too much and shared my plate with the rest!7. Sorbet dessert - Great light dessert for palate cleansing at the end! :)Overall service was great. The waitress gave a brief introduction of every dish and told us how to eat it/ pointed out specific items which should/shouldn't go with sauce. She was also super attentive and awesome :) :) Two thumbs up!!Souz chef Daniel came over to our table a couple of times to answer questions and ask for feedback. Since this restaurant is still pretty new, they're very keen on feedback, and try to customise their dishes to suit individual customer palate. Definitely a great experience :)For $38, I'd say that it was a decent price considering the freshness of the sashimi and the variety of food presented. The food though, was very traditional, and relied heavily on the freshness of ingredients, rather than creative/ intelligent pairing. Perhaps its because it was the set meal? Personally, I think they could have done away with either the tempura or offered a smaller portion of the spicy tuna roll for the set lunch. I'm not sure if I'd pay a much heftier price tag for ""fresh ingredients"", but I'd definitely love to give them a second try, perhaps their ala-carte menu this time!"

So much so, I'm plotting to come back for dinner.just need to find a dinner companion.My request to exclude maguro from my sashimi set was readily accepted. The first time, they actually forgot and included maguro. I only realised after I had eaten 1 or 2 other things. I asked and the plate was whisked away..and returned shortly later with replacement and beautifully replated.I like the hot udon, they use the thinner type of udon, slippery and smooth and not as stodgy or heavy as the fat white common type. The broth was delicate and I slurped down every bit of it.My dining companions both times enjoyed their sets like the chirashi, the wagyu beef, the unagi..but do note, they now serve the chirashi as a single serving instead of the first time when they had 3 separate bamboo shaped serving implements for 3 different chopped sashimi on rice. Even though I was picking up the tab the second time, all my dining companions all commented that for the quality and serving size, the prices were very reasonable.There's also an ala carte menu including grilled items, various rice bowls and sushi. The salmon and ikura don (I think $20) and salad that the table next to me were having seemed to be quite generous in portion size.It's a small space, mostly taken up by the sushi bar. Bar seats get snapped up..both times I was relegated to my (regular) table for 4 but admitted I called on the day itself. The server said they are considering whether to turn the 2 table space into a small private room.Chef Lawrence Chia was there both times and personally slicing the sushi and plating up, chatting with guests. He looked quite serious but broke into a smile when eye contact was made.I enjoyed watching him deliberately moulding each piece of sushi, interspersed with delicate touches of his fingers into the vinegar..(yes even from my far off table, that's how intimate the space is).I don't know if Chef is just really good with faces but the second time, he nodded knowingly at me the moment I walked in. At the end of the meal, there was a 10% discount. YAY!I'm happy it's a walk from my office ;)"

The chawanmushi just had a certain nuanced element to it, which you rarely find elsewhere. For the rolls, I found them a bit too sweet as the chefs seem to like putting some variant to mayo on top, but if not for that, they would have been good too, especially the thinly sliced aburi beef one."

This restaurant is SO popular that our first night here, we tried to grab a quick dinner and they said they were fully booked even though it was pretty late.

I probably had 5 plates over the course of 2 hours this morning. They have an omelette station and noodle bar where they cook to order while you wait. There's also a pastries and dessert area towards the back which I avoided bc ... well, I have to watch my figure when I'm eating this much food. There's a fruit section down the end. The variety of hot foods was great- dim sum, curry, tater tots, oatmeal, stir frys, gyoza, etc. There's also a juice bar with fresh guava, apple, and orange juices.

The place came recommended by a friend of my colleague who is a chef. We all left happy. There was another larger company having their end of year lunch at the same time, and they looked like they were having a good time.The decor at Lime is on the casual side, which is perfect for our occasion. Walking in, you see the desserts all lined up and it looked really good.Compared to other buffets, Lime's thing seems to be appetizers and dessert. They had three long tables of desserts, and another three long tables of appetizers. There was a station for raw food like sashimi, but it's not a highlight. I was impressed by the selection of shellfish- they had more than shrimp, mussels and scallops. There was a meat station with turkey, ham, wagyu beef, braised beef, lamb, duck and chicken, that also has sides of brussel sprouts, glazed carrots and caramelized pearl onions. The onions were absolutely delicious. I liked the attention to detail. Some places give you the meats but not the sides. There was a shared Indian and Chinese station. I didn't try the Indian food. The Chinese food was okay. The appetizers were a standout. There was a corner with Mediterranean dips - hummus, baba ganoush, pita, various salads. There was a long table of bread, cheese, olives and meats. The meats were excellent. I had the blue cheese and it was good. What really stood out was the loaf of bread, which was very soft and tasty. It's hard to find good bread in Singapore. Paired with the echire butter, it was amazing. Everyone tried the bread and butter, and some of us went back for seconds. And the salad bar looked decent, although I did not eat there.The desserts were beautiful works of art. Cakes, puddings, mousses, ice cream. I highly recommend the mini macaroons, which are free. The large ones in the showcase are sold separately. I didn't try the nonya cakes, although my colleagues liked the durian pengat. Their chocolate fountain was orange chocolate, but I had no room to taste it. I'm definitely coming back again with people whom I know like trying many appetisers. Some buffets are for seafood, and others are for their mains. Lime's offerings are great for people who like to graze."

And as befitting for such an important festival, it's time to go ""loco"" over lobsters with Singapore's FIRST local Lobsterfest at Lime at PARKROYAL on Pickering. On every Wed, one can tuck into mouthwatering Maine Lobsters in various styles ranging from lobster gratin to Peranakan Nyonya LOBSTER laksa!If the natural sweetness of this delicacy is what you are hankering for, you may like to park yourself next to this station. In fact, this is my favourite way of enjoying lobster, with just a bit of horseradish and red wine sauce. If Lady Luck is with you, you might even pick one with a bonus lobster roe! Moving on to the hot food section, the unanimous crowd favourite was the Singapore Chilli Crab Maine Lobster, judging at how frequent the giant serving wok was emptied every time a new batch is furiously cooked and served. The sauce is luxuriously rich and not too sweet.But something more outstanding was the Wok-fried Black Pepper Maine Lobster that boasted good wok-hei and excellent aroma imparted by the use of curry leaves. One dish that might ring in some nostalgia is the Maine Lobster Kam Heong style. Meaning ""golden fragrance"" in Cantonese, this is said to be a Malaysian stir fry dish whose sauce base is a magical concoction of fiery bird eye's chilli, curry powder, curry leaves and soy bean paste. However, the gravy was short of the necessary fragrance that would imbue this dish with a sharper character. Do keep a lookout for special lobster dishes such as lobster pizza and lobster bisque with cognac as you claw your way through the extravagant buffet spread! Who knows? Maybe you will be luckier than me and catch a lobster dessert on your visit!"

Nasi Lemak, if you've not heard of it, is a coconut rice dish usually served with fried fish and peanuts, egg, cucumber and a really good sambal chili. This ball was a good representation of all the flavours of Nasi Lemak. The rice ball was coated with peanuts and had a dollop of sambal on top. Their cute little carrot cake with a white chocolate carrot on top. The carrot cake was nice and moist.There was also a yummy Peking duck profiterole, a coconut pandan tart, a chocolate peanut butter cup with Gianduja chantilly cream. As well as some open faced sandwiches which weren't anything to rave about.But my favourite was probably the passion fruit meringue tart which unfortunately I didn't get a good photo of. Funny thing is that I'm not really a fan of passion fruit but I loved the refreshing tartness of the mousse which was silky smooth and topped with a perfectly light meringue.

Since I have only had time for their a la carte menu choices, I can not give a fair rating on the buffet, that seems to be quite popular. I have had chicken as in room dining - slightly overcooked and with hardly any meat on the bones. The mushroom sauce and the hot fires was really good, though. I have also tried the pepperoni pizza for in room dining - it was lukewarm and boring.One day we had lunch in the premises, and I was hoping it would be better when we got it fresh from the kitchen. It wasn't. My rare done burger was a tasteless beef tartare, hardly done at all. Service was also somewhat strange, the waiters seemed slightly confused and all in all I just do not recommend this restaurant."

Best of all are the oysters if your in to that because it's shucked fresh. Since I love oysters I would have been happy just pigging out on them. Atmosphere is very nice, contemporary setting. Service is very good. Price is a little high at $62 +++. Frankly there are other better spreads elsewhere but it's a nice difference in the peranakan spread."

Doesn't come with basil but with ""basil pesto"" which really was dried basil flakes in olive oil. We had it on the side so regular olive oil and basslmic vinegar made it a nice shared appetizer. We both ordered penne with red sauce and we were disappointed. The penne was fine but the sauce was high in sugar content. So chef if you are getting sauce from a jar, don't get the one that has high fructose as the first ingredient. That being said, service and atmosphere were excellent.

They also serve beer.Some gripes are that it can be unbearably busy at lunch times, and the wait and confusion around orders can lead to misunderstandings and frustration, so manage your expectations :)The main let down for me is I feel like the burger is too wet (sauce) and this creates a soggy bun, and also an unwieldy mess to deal with when eating the burger. The cooking and flavour are both good, and it's decently filling.It also tends to the pricey side - however, you are in one of the main tourist locations in Singapore so this is to be expected.Bring a crew, grab a table outdoors, enjoy the water and views, and chomp down a burger and chips!"

Speaking of claypot rice, the most irresistible flavour is none other than the Sliced Pork and Salted Fish version (). With the increase in prices of salted fish, it was a delight to find generous-sized salted fish in the pot of fluffy rice.Meanwhile there is also the Claypot Rice with Chicken, Live Frog and Enoki Mushroom ().  """"---Perhaps due to the cool and comfortable interiors, there was not much of the sizzling sounds or smoky scents of charred rice. Fortunately, I could gleefully scrape off an abundant amount of burnt rice at the base of each claypot and swirl in more dark soya sauce provided alongside.  If you are ordering other dishes, each claypot rice can feed about 2-3 mouths.  The highlight of the day was the  Barbequed Suckling pig $198, which was indeed a terrific dish. Prepared by Barbeque Chef Zheng Guang Liang,  the pig from Hebei China is grilled excellently to produce a crisp, burmished crackling skin and ladies can forget about scraping the fats off the skin. Meanwhile the meat, which was sliced and re-served for easy consumption, was neither too dry nor too greasy--a culinary feat that deserves a round of applause for the chef. Besides the new promotional dishes, regular items such as the Double-boiled Deer Tendon Soup with Deer Antler () $18/person is definitely worth ordering. Made with good quality ingredients and herbs such as cordyceps flowers that warms your body, it is a nourishing brew that is brimming with collagen. Jumping straight to desserts, What forged a deeper impression was the Deep-fried Yam coated with Soya Bean Crisps () $18. The yam was soft, with a crunchy exterior that triggers your sweet receptors but not too much. And the fact that it is made with soya bean gives us a very good excuse to enjoy this indulgent snack!The Claypot rice in assorted flavours are priced at $18 while the Barbequed Suckling Pig is available at $198. For now until 31 Dec 2013, UOB Cardmembers enjoy 50% off the second order of both items. Unless you are dining in huge groups, it would be unimaginable to have two suckling pigs at one go and thus the second order of roast suckling pig can be taken away or consumed on the next visit.Sounds quite like a good deal, isn't it?"

Whether it's food or the tea pouring acrobatics, I  feel like I'm in for something different (in a good way) at every visit. Admittedly, my experiences at the restaurant are colored by the fact that meetings are held in private rooms with assigned servers and I do not foot the bill.First, Sichuan Douhua has a tea dude who walks around with a kettle and a long spout, to pour tea in your cup in the most over the top way. If you have an inner child, it's pretty amusing to watch. The tea itself is pretty fragrant. Next, I like the dishes the rotating dishes on the multi-course lunches. For example, I once had a bowl of hot oil filled with dried chilli's placed in front of me and plate of thinly sliced raw pork. We were instructed to cook the pork in the hot oil and eat it straight. The pork was tender and infused with chilli and mala despite the seemingly simple cooking method. I've also had the sliced fish in hot peppers, which an authentic Sichuan dish though no where nearly as spicy as the ones I've had in Sichuan or Chongqing. The beancurd served here is also very soft and fresh, probably some of the best I've had. Finally, the house special dan dan mian done quite well with chewy, hand made noodles topped with mince meat and chives. The downside to this restaurant is that most other dishes are quite pedestrian. The siew mai and har gow served with the set lunch is supposedly a house specialty but it doesn't blow me away. The soups also lack the powerful depth you get at the great cantonese restaurants. Overall, I can't complain much about Sichuan Douhua as it serves its function as a business lunch venue, but I wouldn't necessarily come out specially to eat on non-work occasions."

However, coming here is an admirable solution to both problems. The set menus are very good ( as part of a big business party, this was a smart move), and the location is stunning, up on the 60th floor of the UOB Plaza. If you can find your way up here, it's well worth a visit; I'd suggest the chili jellyfish, and anything with sichuan pepper and tofu, an intriguing mix. The waitress will warn you, if foreign, to refrain from laughing, , speaking, or coughing while takling some of the hotter dishes; she's quite serious, and you wouldn't want any going down the wrong way, as I'd imagine it akin to a deep breath of CS gas. Traditional green tea is served from long-handled pots ( handing for reaching across the table), and is very welcome for putting out any oral fires. Very highly recommended."

This place is especially fantastic if you made reservations way in advance. When visiting, a local friend did that and we were able to get a spectacular 60+ floor view of the entire Singapore river night skyline, as we arrived in time for sunset to see the lights of the city come on. The view was excellent, but we also had a great time sampling all the local delights, as we opted for the a la carte buffet that had about a hundred dishes we could select from (minimum of 4 people). Most memorable was the Chong Qing chicken, which was super super spicy and we had to drown ourselves in water after that. The fish was good, we loved the coffee pork ribs, the noodles and there was a great selection of 8-10 types of Chinese desserts to choose from, which we really liked. I think the almond dessert was particularly refreshing, after all the heavy meats and oily food. Highly memorable was the tea master who walks around and pours tea using a long sprout, from almost 3 feet away. I think it was called ""Kung fu"" tea. We were highly entertained all night watching him and we would come back in a heartbeat next when we visit!"

There was only one empty table which we grabbed.Set lunch were priced at about $15 and you get a soup, a main course and a drink. It is not cheap but the quality is good if you compare to a normal cafe.The soup of the day was mushroom soup and it had lots of chunky mushroom pieces. I had the fish and chips which was a decently large serving that I had difficulty finishing. It was between finishing the fries or the fish. The batter was nice and crispy.You also get a choice of orange or lemon juice as your drink.I hope the social cause is not a marketing gimmick since having a meal here makes me feel that I have to be nicer and not be my usual b**** about the food/drinks/service. 3-stars for the food, one more for the cause."

I pick something different every time and it's always been one of the best in Singapore. They pride themselves on fresh hand picked ingredients and Sri Lankan and Punjabi cuisine. The Tandoor comes highly recommended- the prawn especially. Lamb, like any other meat, is incredibly tender. This place is five star except for the prices which seem to have steadily increased over the last few years.This place is great for a romantic dinner or having a meal with friends.

I asked so what if my order falls short then the so called manager informed me that he would not serve us! Whoa- what an attitude man- straight away got up as didnt like the so called expected spend attitude and the roughshod behavior of the service staff... spending money is not an issue but to be advised that i needed to order more was very unwelcome... avoid this place if u can.

Patros had a better seating right next to river, amazing food and service and more variety plus better prices!

Without alcohol its about $100 a person with a three course meal, but if you just order a pasta and a non alcoholic drink, $50 per person will suffice. Great for date nights and corporate dining."

The main restaurant is located at the level 5, the sky lounge is located at level 6. With a restaurant week reservation, it is interesting to find that I am being showed to a table at the sky lounge. The place has both aircon and alfresco dining areas, overlooking the The Padang, with a great view of Marina Bay Sands. Today we are having the restaurant week lunch which costs $40++ per person and consists of a starter, a pasta, a main and a dessert, with bread and coffee or tea included.We start the meal with some breads, served with olive oil dip. While the bread is not served hot, it is soft and fluffy inside. Hokkiado Scallops Crudo with Truffle ($25)The raw scallops are lightly seasoned, and goes quite well with the tangy sweet pomegranate arils (seeds) and puree sauce. The dish is served in a colorful and playful, which looks very appetizing. The smoked quail egg is like mini version of the lava egg which is usually found in ramens. Whole Wheat Stracci with Duck & Foie Gras ($32)We are surprised with the chunks of foie gras, which tastes buttery smooth. Although the dish is filled with minced duck meat, the gamey taste of duck is not overwhelming here.For mains, there is 2 choices available.Black Cod with Beetroot and Porcini MushroomsThe cod is juicy and chunky, served a richly colorful bed of beetroot puree. Beef Sirloin with Asparagus and Red Wine SauceThe serving is rather small, about half the size when compared to the cod. Although cooked medium, the texture is a bit tough than preferred. There is barely any sauce.Lastly for dessert, we haveStrawberry, Pistachio & Chocolate Profiteroles ($18)Although the dessert is simply profiteroles, they are distinct in their own taste, especially the pistachio - strong in flavour and light without feeling too creamy.We end the meal with a selection of Fine Teas and Coffee.Overall the food is not bad. Service is not bad too, although it would be better if the staff has made a better job of clearing the bread crumbs on the table. It is not often to see staff using the metal ruler like stuff to clear the table. The restaurant is such a relaxing place that 2.5 hours of lunching has gone in a blink."

For the mains, I recommend the pork, beef, and scallops. Well that's what we tried and everything was delicious. Service is super slow, they serve one course at a time. My water glass was always empty, same comment as another girl on trip advisor: she had to serve herself the drinks. So I recommend coming when you have time to kill because you have to wait a while for your food to come, but when it comes it's good. Show you some pics of the main :)"

I went there for brunch on a Sunday; the first thing that hits you as you enter is the buzz running through the restaurant, not raucous, but sufficiently energetic so you don't get any of the usual stuffiness in museum restaurants. Service is attentive but not uptight;  the wait staff strike a good balance of professionalism and chumminess, offering suggestions for life-changing dishes (which btw was the grilled octopus). One waiter even offered to move us when he saw us struggling with our stroller in a packed corner. I really liked the interior - comfy seating, classy combo of white marble, brass, and lovely lighting pieces. The food was very good - I didn't think it was life-changing, but everything we ordered was solid. We started with the grilled octopus and tuna tartare. Both were delicious, but the octopus at Bochinche still has my heart. For mains, we had the duck stracci with foie gras and their signature taglialini with scampi. The duck ragout was the winner here - homely and full of flavour. For dessert we had the hazelnut feuillantine, which was super indulgent with lovely texture. My prosecco was fruity and perfect for brunch; my husband was pretty happy with his pinot noir.Aura is just what Singapore needs more of - versatile option for date night, an important business meeting, must-do for visitors to Singapore, or a great spot for boozy grown-up brunch with friends."

But the service is non-existent. Waiters take forever to come over. One evening I was there with friends, we had to wait at least 5 minutes for anyone to pay attention to us. We just plonked ourselves down after we got tired of waiting (the lack of service was not due to crowds, in fact, the place was practically empty although there were tables outdoors which were occupied). We literally were helping ourselves to napkins because the waiter did not come over, forgot to deliver even after one of my friends went over to ask and we finally got so fed up one of us walked over to the bar to get the napkins.

That's 8 different flavors of pork belly from the Mangaloca Pig. Meat was served 4 types at a time and grilled in front of us. Starting with the mild flavored ones and ending with the more flavorful types. Flavors here refers to the seasoning / marinate used on the pork belly. Some of the meat pieces were fatty and may turn some people off. It is the fatty pieces that are the most flavorful. The meat is cooked and cut into pieces so it is easy to share. Each set of meat cane with kim Chee and sprouts served on the front side of the grill. They and the fresh lettuce leaves complement the meat well. There are also typical Korean side dishes as appetizers or snacks. Service was ok. There seems to be a lack of water to quench the spiciness of the kim Chee. Maybe they charged for each carafe of h2o. It was a quiet night and one of the staff came over with a camera asking if they can take a photo to post on Facebook. It seems they post every 1st of the month for the last month so hoping to see our group pic then.

It was nice but it was not spectacular. Instant noodle in a Kimchi broth with some vegs, a cheese slice, ham, hotdogs and luncheon meat (spam). I could not see or taste the luncheon meat though my friend said it was there, in tiny pieces. We also ordered a kimchi fried rice which was quite good. The highlight would be the banchan. It was different from other places with the ubiquitous kimchi, anchovies and huge bean sprouts. Over here, there were only 4 but they were all tart which were very appetizing.

The pork belly kimchi stew when compared to the Ginseng chicken is less impressive. On its own it would be a nice meal, though it is stingy on the pork belly. Lots of kimchi and the stew is spicy and appetizing enough. I finished my bowl of rice with it.On the whole, the ambience is casual, and probably surprisingly nice as we left the place without smelling like food. And the pricing is exceptional, $38."

This is the same franchise as the one in LA's Ktown and Korea (although in LA, it's called Palsaik, which essentially means 8 flavors anyways) I'd been to Palsaik in LA (and became a fan!) and was eager to try it out here when I read that they opened about a month ago. One of the things I miss most about LA when I'm in Singapore is the good korean food and was hoping it'd taste just as good here. It did, if not, better. 4.5 stars... Here's why,When you first arrive, you're greeted by a dim interior, with Kpop girls dancing around on the TV screens attached to the brick walls. The space isn't particularly big (and I can see it becoming really crowded, once word hits the street) but it's very well decorated with a nice hip underground feel to it. The staff are super friendly and showed us to our table as soon as we got there. The thing to order here is definitely the '8 flavors' samgyupsal. It sounds like a lot of food but it's really not as it's essentially one thick strip of pork belly for each flavor (good for 2-3 people). The 8 flavors are: Wine, Original, Ginseng, Garlic, Herb, Curry, Miso, Red Pepper. Every single flavor tasted good, my favorites being Wine, Ginseng, Garlic, Curry and Miso (okay I guess that's almost everything) Now, what makes the singapore branch BETTER than the LA one? The service and the flavors.The service: Service here is top notch. Possibly the best I've experience in such a restaurant (of course, not comparing with fine dining type places). Aside from being super friendly and attentive, they cook your food to perfection. Yes, perfection. Sure, there are countless amazing korean bbq places in LA but the one thing I find annoying is they often start cooking your meats for you and then walk away and come back too late only to have it become slightly burnt, overcooked or resulting in you having to flip it over yourself. Not here!! They flip it at the perfect time, cut it up, and then turn off the fire and transfer it onto a small plate for you after it's perfectly cooked so it does not get burnt. This results in pork belly perfection.The food: The Samgyupsal here is actually better than their branch in LA because, the flavors are more distinct. In LA, they do the 8 different flavors as different ""cuts"" of pork belly as well as marinates. However, though yummy, I didn't think the flavors were very distinctly different from each other there. Also, with the different cuts, there were cuts of the pork I didn't like as much resulting in a lot of uneaten meats. At 8 flavors here in Singapore, however, every flavor is made with the same pork belly. This allows you to differentiate and really taste the change in taste with each flavor. The cut aside, the flavors itself really are most distinct too. Super well marinated and bursting in flavor, you can no doubt tell wine from miso from garlic etc etc. The only slight downside for this place is the price point. For a plate of 8 flavors, you're looking at $98. This is before soups, drinks etc. And since (if you're a big eater like us - heehee) a plate of 8 flavors only feeds 2-3 people, you can imagine it becoming really pricey with a big group. Thus, I had to knock of 0.5 stars (but only because of the price) Still, I'll be back, and 8 flavors has no doubt earned the title of best Samgyupsal in Singapore in my books. I just hope the service and food quality remains just as good, even when they start to get super busy (because I know they will soon enough)."

Korean steamed eggs are usually more soft and smooth, but this one has a rather rough texture and might have been overcooked. Portion is huge though.- kimchi fried rice ($8) - SO delicious!!

There are times I will socially eat meat. Don't hate.) GETTING THERE: The restaurant is located in The Central Mall on the 2nd floor. Near the escalators. This mall is like a labyrinth so try not to get lost. DEJA VU: When I saw ""8 Korean BBQ"" I immediately thought of Palsaik, a Korean bbq joint back in Ktown LA. The menu looked especially familiar. The flavors were the exact same as Palsaik's. Turns out the two restaurants are under the same owner. TASTE: I used to be a hardcore carnivore. Meat and carbs all day. So I know a tasty piece of meat when I encounter one. 8 Korean BBQ is legit yo. I didn't expect much because if you've dined at Koreatown LA many times before, you know what's hot and not. 8 Korean BBQ is hot. Their pork belly is JUICY. Their kimchi is a bit salty though. At least the day I had it. So awesome they had brown rice instead of white rice. Puts a smile on a health nut's face. INSTRUCTIONS: Take a piece of lettuce, place on a pink round radish, a slice of pork, then some kimchi. Wrap it up and into your mouth. Repeat. PRICING: 8 Korean BBQ is pricier than Palsaik. The set of eight flavors at Palsaik costs $50. The similar set, if not exactly the same, is double in Singapore's sister location. But if love K-bbq, it's worth every penny. Their juicy pork belly will not fail to disappoint. CONCLUSION: If you ever miss Koreatown LA, you know where to go... 8 Korean BBQ. Make sure you order a bottle of soju with your meal. Gunbae! Cheers! And if you get drunk, don't fall into the river. Those stairs are steep. Please have a designated walking buddy."

Around $90 something for 8 different kinds of pork belly, with less side dishes and smaller meat portions. In LA, i think it's around $38 for better everything. I guess I can't complain though that there's now a 8 saik in Singapore.  The only upside to this place was its kpop atmosphere fit for pregaming."

However, the LA one has different cuts of pork and this place just has 8 different flavors. Each 8 flavors are bursting in taste and immensely delicious. The price is about 2.5 times more expensive than the one in LA but its probably bc the overhead is higher in sg. And the quantity is much smaller as well. 98 bucks for 4 people but honestly, 2 people can finish that portion.  I would say its probably one of the best in korean bbq in singapore but thats not really saying much bc korean food in sg is not that great."

It is creamy, but without being too cheesy, and they're really generous with the amount of crab meat. Their starters aren't very wide, but their mussels with white wine weren't too bad."

Buttery & rich :) - Salad - ok - Peach color cream was really yummy! - Chicken breast - Unfortunately the main star of the dish was sorely disappointing. It was dry and so tough to eat! Very blend too! If not for the aforementioned sauce, I am not sure how I would have eaten it. 2. Bruschetta & smoked salmon. - This starter dish came after our mains which was weird. - The Bruschetta was cold. It wasn't crispy or toasted :( Overall, despite some small hits we left disappointed with the food and will probably not return again. I read other reviews which suggest that their pizza is not bad but I don't think I could risk being served another disappointing portion of cold bread!"

It's not like a high end Italian restaurant but I thought the food was good. I just have to continue to come back to make sure the food is consistent since I last came.

I went a few months ago, and I thought the service was not amazing, and food was horrible. In my opinion.My friend ordered salad with chicken and she said the chicken was way too dry and forced herself to eat the salad. I had a pasta with meat and tomato sauce and I just couldn't eat any of it. It felt to me like they just microwaved meat and hence the tough meat, and pasta was not fresh it was just not up to the standard that I was expecting. I also ordered a coffee but nothing beat ronin or punch in that neighborhood in my opinion. Therefore I haven't gone back ever since.I'm writing this review because I am looking for other cafes and restaurants nearby this neighborhood since I just moved here. But to see this place on top of Ronin made me think the reviews are not legitimate, especially with only 3 other reviews. So let's be real. It may be good enough for locals, but as an Asian who was born and raised abroad, I personally don't like it, but give it one try, as I did, and decide for yourself."

Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let down overall and I am probably not going back unless I have to.I was thrilled by how the dishes were priced in increments of 5 starting at $5. It's a good way to keep track of how much your meal is going to be, and unfortunately also a good way to rack up a hefty bill for what I had assumed would be an affordable dinner. We ordered about 5 things because everything came in really small portions and it added up quite quickly.They're famous for the braised pork which was alright in my opinion.What I did like was the steak with pickled cabbage - for $10 the steak was quite tender and flavorful. The brussel sprouts with salted pork and shiitake mushrooms were quite nice, I thought the vinegar added a nice flavor. Everything else we ordered wasn't really worth mentioning.I think it's more reasonably priced at lunch...

To die for Chirashi.Been seeing many Instagram post on Chirashi. Definitely a food trend here in SG. Asked my ""Yao-Gui"" (greedy) friends to bring me to one and so we ended up at Koji.Visited on a Saturday, the area which is the business district was quiet and relatively empty. It's a tiny shop/bar. A rectangular table bar sitting, seats are lined along the perimeter. Ours seats are right at the back, needed to inch slowly down the narrow path. Their stools have a panel underneath where you can place your bags, rather awkward and ended up leaving my bag on my lap.We had ordered their famous chirashi and one of us had a pork cheek bowl. The Chirashi was amazing. Perhaps I'm used to the U.S. portions, when served I was thinking what a small bowl for the price. Turn out I was wrong, it was filled with so much yummy juicy sashimi and roe. Every bite was absolutely delicious and satisfying. The mix of crunch, juice and taste. Loved it! Highly highly recommended. (Unless you don't take raw food)"

The chirashi bowl was also good and the salmon in particular was juicy.

I like giving chef's a free hand with the food since they do work with produce all day and should know better than me what's fresh and what works together. I wasn't expecting a whole lot since Koji is known for value-for-money kaisendon's rather than particular finesse with sushi, let alone cooked food.We took the $128 option and there were some good dishes. I loved the grilled wafu steak a lot - it was marbled, cooked medium rare with a dash of salt and pepper. It was perfect, so I ordered another plate ala carte. The sashimi platter was pretty neat with a good development of flavors from a light amaebi to a chutoro at the end, though it included the foreigner-friendly swordfish. The nigiri series also featured some seasonal fish that if I remember correctly included chidai (probably yellow back), aji (horse mackerel) and hotate (scallop), dashed with nikiri, sometimes sprinkled with what looked like sudachi or kabusu zest (one too many times actually) and charred here and there. So very crowd pleasing fish but no unusual fish. For some reason, while the fish on the sushi was dressed, the wasabi was plated instead of applied underneath the fish and the rice, gaaaah, that really frustrated me. It was bland and too cold in my opinion, like an afterthought instead of a feature that brings the fish to life. Anyway, another really cool dish was a crab shell holding black miso mixed with crab meat and i think some roe. It was rich, warm and utterly delightful.What didn't do it for me was the tofu starter that seemed kinda hard like it was packaged and not home made. The clam soup was straightforward and could have actually done with tart or chive-ish herbs. Can't remember what else we had but it wasn't memorable. The customary OCD-presentation-skils you'd expect from a Japanese chef were also missing from this otherwise fun bunch of Asian chefs - our dishes were not cleared before the next ones arrived, my first cup of green tea was lukewarm, questions about the fish showed the chefs didn't really know their provenance and the little things like slicing a tomato evenly were lacking. One might argue hey this is a $128 omakase but I'd argue you can get a pretty damn good sushi lunch set at Shinji (my default for excellent and consistent quality) for $125 or less.To be fair, the sake recommendation we got was decent and we had an enjoyable, alcohol-enabled time that evening. If you are price conscious though, do your math because the alcohol and additional ala carte dishes can add up. I'd say Koji is a decent entry level sushi bar and the lunch offerings look like value-for-money. But if you're expecting high quality, really creative Japanese cuisine or you're curious/finicky about good food, then you should look elsewhere."

The idea was a lot more novel than the taste itself. Yet we had absolutely no regrets. The price was oh so reasonable: I paid $2.90 and got a great helping of the alien rice, ikan bilis (without nuts - yes!!!!), a very unreasonably small quarter of luncheon meat (disappointing!), an egg (always a must in nasi lemaks in my book) and most majestically, a very wonderful chicken drumstick (which would cost $1.20 each). The chicken was so juicy and tender inside, yet you would not have thought so just looking at it because it looked so dry and hard on the outside, yet the skin was just so well crispy and seasoned really well. I'll definitely be back for lunch sometime!"

The restaurant was practically empty (4-5 rooftop tables being used only when we went on a late Sunday evening). They force you to pay a minimum of $43++ per person. While the food did taste decent, it was nothing spectacular to warrant that absurd minimum. Rather than forcing people to pay a set dollar amount for overpriced food, they can simply state that each individual must order an entree, if they must set a minimum. Also, I asked what one of the drinks consisted of, and the server kept repeating it had ice and it was sweet...that doesn't tell me anything about what's in the drink. Clearly, he did not know what was in it, which is okay, but instead of simply stating ""let me go find out for you"" he repeated ""ice and sweet"" like 5-6 times until we finally asked if he could get someone else to come explain it to us. I would not go there again knowing the price minimum and service."

I visited SQUE for the first time about 2 years ago, for Restaurant Week and both the service and food was extremely commendable. Since then, I have become a semi-regular here because of their amazing Happy Hour deals (from 5pm - 7pm and then 9pm - 11pm, that's definitely my tip for coming here). I have been very fortunate to have been served for the same lady the last 2 years, perhaps it was by coincidence that she is always here when I visit.However, on today's visit she was not one of those who were on duty and I can definitely say that the service here is less than exceptional. I was here for first drinks with my girlfs after dinner nearby and stayed after they left to have drinks with the boyf who came for dinner / to send me home. While here with the girls, it took us 10mins to try and get the attention of the waiter just to order our drinks - which in all honesty is not great when you have about 5 - 6 waiters around. SQUE is not an exceptional huge place, and I don't expect this to happen because I have always been served under 5mins in my previous visits. Perhaps you could say that I have been pampered by my precious waiters here, but I would expect some level of service at least when it is a lull period. The boyf came at 9:20 while my girlfs left at about 9:30 - and while I would think that the place was a bit more crowded than an hour plus before, most of the tables had already been served. He ordered a soup and pizza, and while the pizza did not come until 9:40 which I would say is understandable but, the soup had not arrived. We decided to cancel the soup order since appetizer had not arrived before the main course and we were denied that cancellation. Their reason - the soup and pizza are done in different ways and that our soup was being prepared. While I understand that, I really don't think that a soup that has been pre-prepared and reheated would take 35mins to come. Even making the mushroom soup from scratch would have taken less time than that! The soup was extremely salty and didn't seem like a freshly made soup at all. The bread that came along with the soup had dark black toast burn marks, but it was still soft as if it wasn't toasted at all. This was DEFINITELY NOT a dish that would have taken 35mins to make. I wouldn't recommend coming here for food, and definitely not for drinks outside Happy Hours. The service here is below expectations (compared to my expectations of other restaurants and not with my previous visits to SQUE itself because I think that would be unfair - probably that waitress that usually serves is was one of the best here) and unless you're prepared for slow service, I would recommend heading to Clarke Quay and its myriad of better restaurants."

There are lots of craft beer from around the world to choose from, although I'd like to see more more American beers. Of course, the extensive list has it's drawbacks. They apparently run out of popular beers often, because I walked away disappointed on two different occasions when they didn't have any Stone IPA. And you will pay a premium for the variety and the location. It is just steps away from the Clarke Quay MRT, right on the river.Update:  I finally tried the food and was pleasantly surprised. The roasted chicken sandwich was great. Juicy and flavorful with fresh, crispy wedge fries. The happy hour really takes the bite out of the prices.

My wife had Tom Yam which was OK but not special. My French fries were hand-cut and crisp  excellent  and also the steak was fortunately OK, although the waiter never bothered to ask how i wanted it.The service was however terrible: the waiter hardly understood any English and came with a wrong drink and later with a wrong plate (I noticed the same happened at another table).

Totally enjoyable evening with friends.Update - went back last week and they have a new Constellations gastronomic menu that offers 6, 7 or 8 courses, including dessert! The 7 course was perfect for us, and we got to order from an amazing selection of their top dishes mentioned above, plus the fantastic dessert art where they come to the table to create your desserts in one large platter. It was amazing to watch AND savour - so yummy, especially the yoghurt creme brulee and valrhona chocolate ball"

Waiters would come in with a tray of dishes and stand near your table, because a second waiter was needed to put the plates on tables. But everyone was polite, warm, and welcoming--you paid for it, after all.The meal was mediocre. The only thing that was memorable was also one of the simpler courses---steak in a simple broth with a small salad (...three bites) and a small meat-filled puff pastry on top of what I assume was some sort of fruit (plums?).Stellar is not so stellar at fine, envelope-pushing-dining but unfortunately that's exactly what it's trying to do. All the meals were too over the top and ambitious on idea, plating, and design, but in terms of execution...not the best.The courses didn't make sense--they didn't flow together or have any sort of link. It seemed like the kitchen was just doing what's trendy or popular in the food world at the moment...at the same time. My dinner date and I were left pretty speechless---often times the food on one plate didn't go together...it just didn't make sense. Or we would be presented with a really magnificent looking something, but one bite would prove that it was nothing but show.I was really excited about coming here and the views really are spectacular. But I would never come here again or recommend it to anyone. I paid more than S$400 for the dinner (not including alcohol) and it tasted like it was no more than S$6.Also, they charge you almost $10 for a bottle of Fiji water and they put it in this fancy little metal tin that's just high enough as to not obscure the Fiji label.

Apparently a full-blown dysfunction seems to have engulfed every aspect of its operations. On its most important national holiday, this pub imploded.  Ordering a pint was like staggering through a dimly lit labrynthe populated by semi-coherent, disorganized, overworked staff.  Yes, you should expect slightly longer waiting times for drinks especially on weekends or special events like this.  After nearly an hour of being misdirected to three different locations and offered lame excuses like ""We ran out of glasses"" (at 6:45 pm!), it is hard to justify wasting the better part of an hour in this multi-storied madness.Molly Malone's has lost its Mojo.  The owner is an old Glencore oil trader.  Johnny H.  My Boy, you racked up a huge demurrage bill and you failed to delivery in the window.  And Gerry C., no more Facebook social media broadcasts ...  It may have a loyal following of dedicated fans who can tolerate abuse or have a magical connection for getting served in less than half an hour.  We moved on to Penny Black and had a cheaper pint from a more hospitable server at an outdoor cash bar in less than 30 seconds.  A few patrons who shared similar disappointments on Facebook where chastized by the frontman musician who blasted them for not being regulars and told them to take their business elsewhere in less than polite language.  If that is the case, he should not be soliciting patronage on Facebook.   I took my business elsewhere and will not be back... even if someone wants to host me.Kind of unbelievable that a pub confronted by a huge thirsty mass of customers cannot figure out how to efficiently and profitably satisfy this demand but instead ends up encouraging them to head next door for a more positive and memorable experience."

Another unique dish is crispy chicken skin on a shrimp paste and lined at the bottom with sliced almond. Served with plum sauce on the side. Fish was steamed and topped with bacon. Looks good but I don't like fish with too many bones. Chives with lots of deep fried lard is very good, even for someone like me who doesn't like chives in general. Black vinegar pork trotters was nicely balanced . Can taste vinegar, sugar and ginger. Noddles was the last main dish. Too full to eat it. The dessert was delicious.

IKI is probably one of the very few soba places in Singapore that uses 100% buckwheat (imported from Akita prefecture in Japan), which means the noodles are very al dente & also gluten-free!Noguchi-san came from Japan 2 years ago to start this soba shop and has a vision for introducing the healthy benefits of soba to Singapore, especially for office workers. Even though Noguchi-san was busy, he took the time to come talk to us and bring us soba water (to mix with the dipping sauce and enjoy as a broth after the meal). He said that he prefers to run a casual dining environment because he wants to focus on providing high-quality, nutritious food at affordable prices. Talking with him you can really tell he cares about the food he is serving and the people he is serving it to. As for the food, I had cold dipping soba with a tuna/salmon rice bowl for around $15. Noguchi-san allowed my mother to customize her set with a cold eggplant/daikon/sesame seed soba and a teriyaki salmon rice bowl ($18). Each set comes with soba tea as well as a soba yogurt pudding/dessert. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. Really hoping more people come and visit this hidden gem!"

I spied the duck soba for $11 on the menu, and decided that was going to be my lunch.When it arrived at the table (with a smile and quite soon after ordering), it looked as you see in the picture - large portions of pink, tender duck breast floating on an island of soba noodles surrounded by a steamed spicy broth and topped with finely chopped spring onion and a sprinkling of sesame seeds.Except the photo doesn't capture the steam of freshness curling above the rim of the bowl, bringing wafts of heady flavour to the senses.Hot, fresh and delicate this was truly a great, and seemingly health, lunch.The duck was gorgeously cooked. Perfectly pink and tender, with a smoky flavour it was melt in the mouth and delightful to the tastebuds. The soba were also tasty and cooked through (just past al dente, but not mushy) which is right in the sweetspot they were suckingly good and the spring onion added a zingy contrast, whilst the sesame seeds provided crunch.And then the broth... brimming with flavours and spice this was just divine. Every heavenly slurp was savoured and when I hit the bottom I could not believe it was over...And yet, as I sat back, I realised I was satiated. This was the perfect meal.I am still happy :)At $11, for stunningly cooked duck, in a well-seasoned broth bursting with flavour, and enhanced by soba noodles - this truly is perfection. I wouldn't change a thing."

They didn't seem to be talking to each other, asking for orders that had already been taken- Waiter dumped lemons in my sparkling water without asking if I wanted them, he then proceeded to take my wine glass away without letting me finish my wine.- Worst part, the steaks were way over cooked. One supposed to be medium rare, one medium. Both very well done, totally overcooked destroying a $120 wagyu rib eye. - Side dishes and sauces were average. Brussel sprouts were drowning in oil, creamed spinach was bland / cheesy with very little resemblance to proper steak house creamed spinach. Chimichurri was some blended fluro green disaster. + Meat had good flavour and showed potential, if only they cooked it right. + Peppercorn sauce was great, really rich+ House wines were good quality, enjoyable+ Staff are very friendly, view is pretty good (not from inside though)+ The set meals looked well priced for 3 courses (~$50)Maybe this is a better lunch place for the city crew. We wouldn't go back unfortunately, there's just too many great places in Singapore to spend $350 on somewhere like this."

I didn't complain too much as it made for a quiet and intimate dinner.  Our order was as follows:Appetizer: Split Bone Marrow - Scrape off the marrow from the bone and spread it across the three thin wafers. Just lovely... wish there was more... :)Main Course: - Tasting of Trio, which includes a cut of Tenderloin, Sirloin, and Wagyu Ribeye - The star of the show was clearly the Wagyu Ribye. Perfect amount of marble with a good mix of salt and pepper to accentuate the flavors. The Sirloin was ehh (likely because the Rib Eye was so good). The Tenderloin was solid, but like most Tenderloin dishes needs a great sauce to make it work. - Sear Tasting of Ribeye, which includes a cut of Kobe Beef, NZ Hereford, and Wagyu Ribeye - The star of this order was the Kobe Beef (probably the most expensive of the lot) and of course the Wagyu Ribeeye, which is the same as the previous order. Overall a solid steak restaurant. Prices I thought were just right relative to the quality of the cuts of meat given. My recommendation would be start off with the Split Bone Marrow and go for a full order of the Australian Jacobs Creek Wagyu Ribeye steak - 250 grams. You can't go wrong."

It's mostly a social occasion. Family gets together and chats and eats as the punnets come to the table. Slow sips of jasmine tea. So the setting is important. It has to be quiet and relaxing enough to chat, comfortable and spacious and lit enough to be there for a while without feeling cramped or tiring your eyes.And of course the food has to be edible, but in a departure from my usual style I'd say it's almost less important. Tim Ho Wan has good food, but it's not a very nice experience. Crystal Jade at Plaza Singapura has good-ish atmosphere but the food is not good enough for the money (the Bugis MRT one was much better, especially the xiao long bao, before it closed - but its atmosphere sucked). Between the two, I'd pick atmosphere any time. Luckily, this dilemma is solved by Peach Garden, which presents good food in a great and appropriate setting, with polite and efficient service and, naturally, plenty of families enjoying dim sum. The main dining hall does not need description, but I'm including a photo of the view anyway. The private rooms definitely have the better side, but you could argue the Chinatown side is more ""interesting"", has more stuff going on. Either way, the room is spacious, the tables nicely far apart (so you're only dining with YOUR family) and the ceiling high enough that you do not feel crushed. The food was good. The sauce accompanying the rice rolls tasted more complex and balanced than the usual sweet soy mix. The pomelo sago mango soup was not quite to the level of Tim Ho Wan's, but good enough that I wouldn't bother heading to the latter to get my fix. The scallop-chestnut-spinach-caviar thing was really great, I just had to order another one. How great? Well, Luca Turin describes a certain type of perfume masterpiece as what happens when you blend two ingredients at such a ratio that they become, together a different scent and you cannot separate them anymore. Similarly, the Berlin Philharmonic used to be known for playing so thoroughly together that you couldn't make out the individual violins in the violin section, or, if a cello and a horn were to play the same melody, either of the instruments individually. This is what happens with this dumpling. I can't tell what goes in it, because it blends together really well and becomes something more than the sum of its parts. Service was really good. My tea cup was always refilled, but I never spotted them doing it. In fact, I thought the waiters disappeared into the background, but somehow, whenever we needed something, they magically appeared and sorted out our problem immediately. Experience, I guess. This place seems popular and has been around for a while. I'm happy because I've finally found a place to take the in-laws for dim sum."

Since the opening of the first Peach Garden outlet at Novena Gardens in 2002, they have received numerous accolades and awards from renowned publications such as Singapore Tatler's Best Restaurants Guide and Singapore Top Restaurants Award from Wine & Dine.We were bringing a friend around town and decided to have dim sum at the Peach Garden OCBC Centre restaurant as it is known to have a great view of the city.Only a small selection of dim sum items are available, i noted only 18 items. Century Egg Porridge is a must order for me when eating dim sum. Good gluey consistency of the congee and there was plenty of shredded pork. Love the crispy crackers on top too. Peach Garden supposedly has one of the better Steamed Creamy Custard Buns ($5.20) around. The buns were fluffy and light but i found the texture a little too gelatinous and it lacked that 'liu sha' (flowing lava) feel. Taste wise, it was satisfactory but i thought it could do with a richer salted egg yolk taste.Baked Mini Egg Tarts ($4.80) were delightful but yea on the pricey side because they're so mini. But yea love the wobbly egg custard on top of the lovely puff pastry.Deep fried Prawn and Fresh Avocado Roll ($6) had an identity crisis and the Deep fried Savoury Yam Pudding with Minced Meat and Portugal Sauce ($5.20) was soaked in oil. Service was BLEARGH. Well it started with the staff being rather pushy when i was ordering our first round of dim sum. Firstly, we were waiting for S who was parking so i didn't want to order everything at one go. Secondly, i have a tendency to over order (especially for dim sum) so i was making a conscious effort not to go crazy. However, that was met with some outwardly disdain by the staff (due to my small order) which i absolutely do not appreciate. Do i look like i can't afford dimsum? So i reigned in my unhappiness because i was hosting a friend.The screw up was when they absolutely messed up our second order which took forever to come. 15 minutes into waiting, our plates were cleared after they asked if we were waiting for more food, which was strange. Well we thought our food was going to arrive soon after but nope, that didn't happen. Another 10 mins later when we checked with them again, we found out that they forgot our order (which they didn't tell us directly but we saw and overheard the commotion). Another 10mins passed before our order finally came and it was the wrong order. We had to make do with the messed up order because obviously we weren't going to wait for another 30 mins. The Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($4.80) attempted to calm me down a little. Juicy well marinated strips of char siew enveloped by the softest pillow bun.What happened after the meal was an instagram post on the meal and me complaining about how terrible the service was. I have to applaud the Peach Garden Marketing/PR team for resolving the issue immediately. Good service recovery i must say. I've been informed that the staff involved have been counselled. I don't know if it's special treatment because i'm a food blogger but i would like to give them the benefit of doubt.So yea, hits and misses at the Peach Garden OCBC Centre. If you're looking for decent dimsum with a view, it's ok. Well on the service end, it really depends, no matter where you go."

Ai yu bing is a soft jelly with chrysanthemum flower flavour.  Another thing to get here are their moon cakes which seem to taste better every year.

Fair enough... though we wish they'd warned us that upstairs meant a noisier, clubbier vibe versus the more 'restaurant-y' feel of downstairs. Food menu's limited to four ""mains"" and a good spread of bar snack/tapas type items. The cheese toast was... underwhelming. I'm not sure why anyone would order it. It was so pedestrian that I can't even describe it convincingly beyond ""it was mediocre and underwhelming"". And forgettable. The grilled avocado was actually a salad (description didn't make that clear), the dressing was nice, a sharp Japanese dressing that went well with the greens and tomatoes, though it felt overpriced when the only thing that differentiated it from a MOS Burger salad was the presence of avocado. The fried salmon skin was... well seasoned though not perfectly fried, the skin was a bit hard to bite through and not completely airily crisp. (I suspect the oil hadn't been hot enough.)The duck somen was tasty, though the portion was tiny.Drinks though boded well, the homemade plum wine is to die for, a good balance of sweet and tart, it's probably a better appetiser than any food item on the menu. The cocktails sounded interested and the date's Boruto 80 or something like that was a pleasant blend of cucumber, mint, and grape. I felt it needed a bit of sharpness (like green apple), but it wasn't bad by any means.Overall I'd come back for that homemade plum wine. And while I'm there I might order more food. I'll have low expectations, but hey, the food was edible at least. There're bars with worse."

I usually get the fish and I also tried the veg with guacamole. Here's the tip. If you order the veg for only one of your tacos it includes a generous portion of guacamole. It's nice you get to mix and match. Help yourself to various hot sauces and raw onions. It's pretty comforting food but you eat with all the noise and crowd at the communal space benches. They could have included a small serving of salsa per order I thought.

This is by far the best Korean-Chinese restaurant here and the service, quality, and the atmosphere were all superb!  I thought it was odd that any Korean would dare open a Korean-style Chinese cuisine in a country mostly of Chinese descent. Non-Koreans are probably unfamiliar with this cuisine so how would they know to spot a good Korean-Chinese food nor recognize when they see one? To clarify, the food served here is not Korean. Nor is it Chinese. It's food that Chinese people created many years ago to cater to Korean's taste buds when they immigrated to Korea. Few popular dishes you MUST try are: noodle dishes: Jjajangmyun, jjamppong; fried shrimp with sweet and sour sauce: kkanpoong saewoo; fried meat with sweet sauce: tang soo yukWe craved jjajangmyun for quite some time now and had no idea where to look in Singapore, until we found this gem. They have a great set menu going for $25/person with sample food listed above so it's def worth a visit. Can't wait till we return! The service was great, which really made my day."

We literally stumbled across Tae Woo today, and would have completely missed it had Watami not turned us away. In a bid for ginseng chicken soup, we decided to give TW a shot. At 9ish, the restaurant only had two other tables. Decor is a combination of industrial hanging lightbulbs and country farm, with pots and pans and other homely decor artfully placed around. Even the serviettes were stacked in a pretty arc. Plus points for effort! A quick glance at the menu disappointed us, but no matter. Decided to ask the Korean lady if there was any similar option off menu, but her English was quite poor and we deduced that there probably wasn't. There was jajangmyeon though, which I happily ordered, together with a side of boiled dumplings. The jajangmyeon arrived with a pair of scissors, and the same lady demonstrated that we should only cut once, because ""long, nice"". Ok, got it! And wow, the wheat noodles were chewy and the black bean sauce heady and piquant. The sauce was chockfull of onions, with their sweetness sweated out, infusing the sauce with an interesting flavor. The boiled dumplings came sitting in a layer of water. Upon the first bite, the skin was thin and plain, but the filling was generous and well seasoned. We were a little shocked, to be honest, that the food was actually good. Confident of the restaurant's standard, we flipped through the menu and placed an additional order of japchae, another one of my favorites. Told the waitress to lay off the rice, and she nodded. In broken English, she then tried to indicate that the japchae noodles were firmer, unlike the jajangmyeon. She didn't quite know how to say soft, though, and we made the hand sign for squishy with a questioning glance, to which she nodded vigorously. That was.. quite funny. The japchae came with rice though, and a side of egg drop soup. She apologized for the oversight but we thanked her anyway. And the noodles.. were even better than the jajangmyeon's! Springy and sweetened with the addition of many vegetables, it was quickly inhaled and poor jajangmyeon was left to languish. The three dishes set us back by $50, which is a pretty reasonable amount for two mains and a side. Plus, we were full to bursting and waddled off very happily. Yelpers, you heard it here first. Better visit TW before it's no longer a secret and standards start dropping."

It was the little things Omnivore does that elevated it above its main competitor the Daily Cut for me.The more interesting variety with edamame, chickpeas and smoked duck making an appearance, were more appealing than the DC standard fare.Omnivore being smaller, also meant that it was less busy and has the ability to turn around the meals much quicker as a result.It's ever so slightly cheaper despite retaining the huge portion sizes DC commands.There is also a better selection of sauces and they provide these to you at payment, which I think is a far better system than the self-serving pump style offered elsewhere.Having experienced Omnivore many times now I've seen some of the drawbacks. It can get incredibly busy, and downstairs in Chevron House can get hot. When it's busy the well-oiled machine doesn't run so smoothly.Also they can run out of ingredients, and whilst this in itself isn't a huge problem, their failure to communicate this until AFTER you've paid means that you end up desperately scrambling for an alternative to complete your order, as you don't want to be the one holding everyone else up.Omnivore is still a great choice for lunch for me, and I visit regularly, however there are some chinks in that seemingly impervious armour."

Until they decided to ask the chef which was just right behind prepping my steak order.Next I saw was while waiting for my steak to be done, all the girls were sitting down, some chatting at the cashier counter and some standing, using their phones, leaving some food uncovered and I witnessed a mosquito feeding on one of the chicken thighs.Seriously do these people even care about food cleanliness at all? There is no email that I could write to the boss so let's hope someone from the company sees this and decided to rectify it. Thirdly, no nets/card payment, cash only for both outlets. Tons of inconvenience if you had a distance to walk to the ATM machine."

It was more a review of the operations, business model and niche that Daily Cut addressed, than the food itself, because I found it incredible that no one had tackled this niche earlier. Well ok it's not that incredible given the high cost of running a takeaway shop that depends almost solely on lunchtime turnover. In my review, I mentioned that competitors like Smor and the Korean shop should wise up to this easy profit opportunity, and true enough the former started offering easy to order muscle meals. I also mentioned that DC should improve it's assembly line efficiency because the queues were ridiculous. Well, I ended up taking a break from DC for awhile because of the lines and a couple of months back, heard from a friend that a DC clone had opened at Chevron House...so off I went to check out Omnivore.Omnivore pretty much what I like about DC with the kinks mostly ironed out. The line moves fast (possibly because Omnivore is still less known than DC), the assembly line is more organized (one person takes your order and money upfront, yells at the protein guy to cook your protein if its a steak, passes it to the legumes and veg lady, who passes it to the protein cutter who passes it to the packaging/sauce lady), food portions are HUGE (WOOOHOOOO!) and the prices are slightly cheaper. I like that Omnivore improved on the taste and tenderness of some items that are similar to DC, specifically the chicken breast and thigh, and their beef and salmon steaks are worth the +$. There are interesting sides like aloe vera as well, and the sauces are simple but tasty. Props to Omnivore for cashing in on the affordable paleo niche and improving the playing field! If I'm not wrong, the owner also runs the Old Tea Hut, which I think is another brilliant idea and I wish I thought of that hahaha."

The parmesan cheese is powdered from a can and the smoked duck was obviously frozen then reheated onsite. How this place stays afloat is beyond me especially with Daily Cut just steps away (and even DC has gone downhill over the years). Clearly the owner is more concerned about margin than quality. I can only imagine that clustering with Moss burger and Guzman y Gomez make this place stand out as a healthy choice.

There is a wide range of fresh vegetables and dressings and cheese, much like how it's done in USA, Europe or Australia.

The fillings here are so much fresher and tastier though - even the cheese tastes fresher and less 'plastic'. Another reason why its one of my favourite joints to eat at around the CBD area - I've never had to wait or hover around for a table - it seems that this place attracts a greater take-away crowd, so there's always plenty of room for you to sit down for lunch there. My top recommendation for the filling would be the roasted veggies - mushrooms, capsicum, eggplant and zucchini, I think that the way they've roasted the veggies here are incomparable to any other sandwich place in Raffles Place. I think alot of people who aren't vegetarian would automatically skip past the all veg option - but unless you're a veggie hater, honestly this sandwich will change your mind, I love it!Portions are very generous - larger than the 6 inch at subway, so it makes a decent lunch."

No lah...) and the only prescription was authentic Nasi Padang. Let's be honest, this meal is never pretty, and Rendezvous was no different. After selecting your dishes from the chef's counter, you head over to a dated cafeteria style seating area overlooking Clarke Quay. When your dishes come out, bright yellows, deep browns and milky reds sit - barely identifiable chicken, fish and veggies bobbing and gasping for their last breath - before you smoother your rice with them, but day-um it's good. The sambal brinjal, korma chicken and chicken rendang were my personal favourites, and there was something that involved potatoes that I still dream of. So delicious. Overall, I felt the veggie dishes had more complex, rich flavours than the meat dishes, so in the future I'd probably just opt for a full on veggie smorgasbord. But it seems no matter what you choose, your eyes will always be bigger than your stomach, so prepare to come here and eat. (And to spend some cash to do so!)"

Anyways, I called and made a reservation and I enquired about the free flow and they did confirm that it was still on.When we arrived, we were seated at a nice table near the river, and we ordered 5 times the free flow but  were told after that the free flow is only in their 3rd level lounge. So we decided to go upstairs and order 5 x the promo, only to learn that you had to pay downstairs first . So down again... when we tried to pay, only then we learned that it was impossible to get 5 times the free flow and one alacarte (since one of my friends is pregnant). In the end, we ended up eating all alacarte at our original table which was ok, but it would have been nice to have been told so at the start so we could have been spared of walking up and down the stairs.The food was not bad but nothing special either, the calamari were nicely done (not a chewy batter job as you get so often) and the burrata with parma ham was delicious. We also had three pasta dishes: truffle ravioli, spaghetti puttanesca & penne arrabiata, a pizza, a meat dish, some bruscetta and a salad, all of them were just a-ok.Overall, the view and atmosphere near the river is ok, but the food and the service is nothing special, to me this is an unremarkable place so we will probably look for another place to get drinks and dinner next time."

However, we were starving and Riverfront dining looks good and thus, we decided to make have dinner at Pasta Fresca - which was one of the few shops that we walked past.Funnily, there was only one waiter taking orders from the guests seated outside. Not sure if there will be a bigger crowd later on but one waiter? Come on.Anyway, the service was pretty slow in terms of order-taking but our food came pretty fast, much to our surprise.Verdict:Spaghetti Amatriciana - Why is the spaghetti so thick??! It looks that it was soaked in hot water for too long. The sauce/toppings were ok, no complains.Al Funghi E Asparagi - Sauce was delicious and flavourful. My partner order Linguini to go with this and the pasta was done al dente. Perfect.Minstrone soup - Priced at $16 you'd would expect something better but all we got was a small serving of vegetables in plain soup. Soup that tasted very bland. A very poor excuse for soup."

To be honest, I picked this place with the family after walking around Singapore for a few hours. It was hot out, I wanted to replace and I prefer Italian over Asian food. We were seated pretty quickly and there was a decent selection of food to pick from, which made it great as a vegetarian. The location is great, right off the river. You can either sit outside along the river, or inside the small restaurant, which has AC. We sat inside to cool off from our day. We ordered pretty quickly and the waiter was good about making sure we had enough water. I selected the gnocchi with pesto sauce, which honestly was pretty dang good, but the portion size was very small especially compared to some of the other plates that came out. The only downside was the portion size, otherwise I would recommend this little spot to others!"

The place is by the river so you have a nice view siting outside and they have fans on to keep you cool. I enjoyed a cocktail which was made of mango and prosecco... Nice! I had the starter garlic bread with mozzarella. I think I should have gone for the bruschetta to get some more flavour. I had the mushroom crepes for my main and needed to add pepper to give it some more flavour.

It's really pleasant to just kick back after a long week or day and feel the evening breeze blowing through your hair. On the downside, the sitting capacity of the restaurant immediately halves if it rains too heavily as you wouldn't want to sit outside.I've never tried anything else here by the pizza, and they're good stuff. The crust is hot and yummy, and the ingredients fresh. If you're not too sure what to order, give the margherita a go before ordering anything else, as I believe that you can tell how good a restaurant's pizza will be through its most basic dish.I'm a big fan of the marinara and the vegetariana. If you're feeling in the mood, you can give their selection of wines a shot. All the fancy wines in bottles are pretty expensive, but you can always get a glass of house pour for S$8.30. Or, if you're like me, you'll stop pretending you understand wine and just order a beer instead! ;)"

Totally not worth the heavy price tag of paying about $100 for 2 people, though that is with a glass of wine and beer. The squid ink pasta, lack luster. I've definitely had better. The same was with my dish which was spinach ravioli in a red sauce with olives and anchovies. Even the tiramisu was lackluster at best. My mom makes a KILLER tiramisu which she learned from my dad. It's hard to beat that authenticity. I can honestly make these dishes at home and they'll taste the same as this, if not better, but with a cheaper price tag."

Must be that crazy jingle that kept playing on TV - I can still hum the tune from vague recollection.So, I finally tried it and I can see why all my friends have fond memories of it. It is a little bit like Jack's place, the Italian edition (and with better food). The interior decor makes for a nice casual date or dinner with a large group. I had the mushroom and vegetarian pizzas and both were pretty good - the base was not to thick and they were very generous with the toppings. The vegetarian is probably the winner because of the effort taken to char-grill the vegetables which gave the pizza an extra kick of flavour. Will be back for more, have to make up for lost time!"

I am not sure if the Bukit Timah Rd one still exists but that was the branch I use to frequent when I was younger. Pasta Fresca serves hearty home style  Italian food which is rather heavy( chunky tomato sauce and cream sauce) unlike your modern Italian restaurant. I am not a huge fan of such Italian cooking but a single dish that demands praise would be their Seafood Marinara pasta, the spicy flavors are great with the chunky tomato sauce and seafood mix. With that said Pasta Fresca also serves a decent brick stove cooked pizza. The view facing the river does indeed make up for the slightly under par food."

When I can't make up my mind, I'll take a mixture of the beef & chicken (best of both worlds). 3. Hotplate pork - Ok4. Hotplate fish - Ok but it has quite a lot of bones so definitely not recommended if you are in a rush. Furthermore, it's a bit oily too for me personally. 5. Kimchi noodles- A bit Too spicy for me.

There're so many stores at the central market but we settled on this because they had tofu soup (which I was craving), it was crowded, and it was cheap ($5-8 range). I ordered the tofu soup & my friend had the chicken hot plate, only to realize that it was small portions and really not Korean food, in any sense of the food. For eg my tofu soup didn't have any kimchi in it, and was instead filled with hard lettuce strips. There's supposedly pork inside, but it's minced pork instead of slices, and maybe 2 little clumps. The tofu was okay, I guess. The soup was tasteless, not like those comforting kimchi or tofu stews at many of the better Korean restaurants at Tanjong Pagar/Telok Ayer/Chinatown point. The rice had undercooked clumps. My friend found her hot plate chicken very insubstantial and basic too. My friend has been to the other Korean place right across from Sun, and it's apparently much better! You get what you pay for, I suppose. Sigh wasted a meal here."

The beef and fish, albeit not being top-grade meat, were pretty tasty, and the rice was decent as well. This stall is definitely not trying to be a pretentious eatery, with kimchi instant ramen stacked on the cupboards for everyone to see, but they serve a variety of korean food, and their tofu soup comes with options to add ramen and egg and other stuff, which is always fun.

Of course, by this point, the first roll was already half eaten... Still no apology was offered... Adding to the calamitous meal were the poor acoustics, which amplified the nearby Friday night girls night table's giggling into terrifying hyena hunting levels.PARTING THOUGHT: Platypus might be better off seeing up cafeteria style...

It's so gooey (melted cheese), the caviar gave it enough salt and there is more lobster on this bowl then the rolls. Warning: Do not be deceived by the serving size. Looks small (even for the ""main"" size) but it's rich, I was sufficiently full eating this.Partner ordered Spicy Garlic Lobster Roll. The set comes with chips - we both agreed it tasted exactly like Calbee chips with a tiny sprinkling of truffle oil. Oh and a side of greens. The highlight of the roll was the bread - so buttery, crunchy and slightly crisp on the outside. The lobster though was overpowered by the garlic flakes - we couldn't really make out whether we were eating lobster or other seafood. In all fairness, that's our mistake - we should have ordered The Traditional which simply poach the lobster meat with butter, lots of butter.

I am American after all.)nomVnom is a 100%-vegan fast-food joint in the food court basement of Clarke Quay Central. They do vegan burgers, a variety of sides, some desserts, and a variety of hot and cold drinks.I had the ""Meatless Mexican,"" which is a soy patty with black olives, jalapeño, tomato, mustard, and lettuce. Now, I'm from Texas, so I know Mexican food -- and aside from the jalapeño, nothing about this burger was ""Mexican."" But who cares? It was delicious!For a side, I had the Vietnamese Yam Roll and OHMYGOSH WHAT IS THIS PURPLE DELICIOUSNESS. I was tempted to get up and order another side of the Vietnamese Yam Roll, because it was that amazing. But I was too embarrassed because I'd already demolished my meal in less than 15 minutes, ha!For a drink, I got good old-fashioned American root beer (hard to find in Australia, so I was surprised to see it in Singapore) and they gave me some free apple cider as well. Score!Atmosphere-wise, this is just a basic food court, so expect cramped food court seating, but it's not a big deal.Their patties are also free from garlic and onion if you are avoiding those. I'm not sure about their sauces.Anyway, definitely worth trying this place for a quick lunch or dinner if you're around the Clarke Quay Central area. And if you're vegetarian or vegan who's visiting Singapore and craving Western food, make an effort to seek this place out!"

Vegan, gluten-free (mostly), gloriously onion-free (I forgot to ask) and supertasty! A tantalizing blend of flavors and textures, super healthy ingredients. A cold-pressed beet-apple-carrot juice was the perfect accompaniment. I've since tried their smoothies, which are also delicious.They do a brisk business - it was crowded throughout the lunch hour, and yet my meal was ready within minutes. Food prep area is out in the open, so you can watch them put together your salad and see how clean everything is. Service is exceptionally friendly and efficient. In-house orders served with reusable dishes and silverware. Prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get. Credit cards accepted. Open 8:00am to 8:30pm, closed Saturdays and Sundays. Atmosphere knocks it out of the park with sky-high ceilings and glass walls that let in loads of natural light.

A colleague recommended Beng Thin as I guess it has been an establishment for quite many years in Singapore. This is not the original location but I'm guessing they started out as a smaller joint somewhere in the heartland and with years of success opened a much larger and fancier spot here.They have a variety of set menus to choose from with prices ranging from $400-$1000-ish for a party of 8. We came right before CNY and had a guest visiting from the states so we did the whole Lo Hei thing and ordered a variety of items a la carte.Everything we tried was pretty tasty. This was the first time I ever tried fish ball soup - something about it having deep fried fish bladder (is that what fish ball soup is?) - I wasn't totally grossed out so that was a plus.I guess I'm not very adventurous when it comes to Chinese food, especially because there is usually a heavy focus on seafood and I'm not a fan of seafood. When I tell folks I don't like Chinese food, the whole room usually goes quiet and someone yells at me to leave Singapore immediately.Well Beng Thin Hoon Kee is A-OK in my books, that's exactly how I would describe it.

Not bad.  Crispy chicken: it comes with the prawn crackers and skin is crispy! It's a lovely dish to have. Steam fish (not sure what's the name): not so good as the texture of the fish is powdery seems to be not too fresh, probably due to the Chinese New Year period.Stir fried lobster: lovely!

But still saltishYam Paste with pumpkin & ginkgo: everyone on the table agree that it's the best dish! It's really good with the ""cong you"" smell! I will miss this dish!

The plates and bowl were constantly changed after almost after every 2 dishes. However when the birthday song was played on the PA system, it can be hardly heard.

It reminded me of the restaurants that I went to during my trip to Japan recently... the sushi bar manned by a Japanese sushi chef (?), the yamazaki and suntory whisky bottles neatly placed in a line... All these little details added to the whole genuine dining experience.We sat down and were promptly served by one of the staff who asked us what we would like to drink. Good attentive service staff. I ordered a Sake (Salmon) and Swordfish Don Kyu which I saw was recommended by a fellow Yelper- was not disappointed! The slices were nice and thick for $20, slightly more than what I would usually pay for a Don at the usual Japanese chains like Sushi Tei, but there was definitely no compromise on quality! All Don Kyus also come with a little appetiser dish (I think mine was seasoned octopus bits which was alright), miso soup, watermelon slices, and Japanese pickles. So the $20 sure had alot of mileage!Another dish I would recommend is the Sashimi Moriwase. Very fresh sashimi - also thickly cut with a generous portion of wasabi. Probably would have ordered the 18-piece set instead of a 12-piece if we had more stomach space... At $48, it was a little pricey but it would probably cost the same elsewhere. They did not compromise on the quality and portion though, which I think is really important when it comes to sashimi.As the saying goes, you know its authentic Japanese food when you see Japanese people eating there, which is what we saw. Highly recommend it and will definitely be back here again!"

The Don itself is pretty filling with lots of sushi rice, as well as a generous serving of fresh and thick sashimi. The don itself should be enough to fill a girl up assuming she has an average appetite.The unagi maki roll is pretty good too, but I do feel that they are not as generous with their unagi serving.Do NOT order the salmon roe chawanmushi.

Chef Peter, the grumpy chef who first started Wasabi Tei at Far East Plaza, helms the restaurant at Mohamed Sultan. Just a couple of months back, Chef Peter opened his third restaurant, Mitsuba By Yurine Japanese Restaurant, at The Central, Clarke Quay.There is quite a good view of the Singapore river from the inside of the restaurant. Do remember to reserve those seats if you want to chill out with your friends (not a date). We started with the Ebi Tempura (5pcs for $12). The prawn is fresh but the batter was a little too thick. The batter was thicker the second time i had this. Maybe i'll try the soft shell crab next time.  Bentos are very affordable, just like Chikuwa Tei. I had the Natsu Bento ($40) with Mackajiki (Swordfish) Sashimi, Gindara Teriyaki, Chawanmushi and Miso Soup. I could not finish the thick juicy slabs of swordfish sashimi which was crunchy as well. Very good fish i must say. The teriyaki cod fish was fatty and oily in a really tummy satisfying way. Love the charred and sweetened bits that coat the fish.Chef Peter is well known for his generous Chirashi and you just gotta have this. The staple at Chikuwa Tei is sold here at $28 but there are 4 differently priced dons and it goes up to $68. We had the Natsu Chirashi Sushi ($38) which has fatty salmon belly, scallops, swordfish, a little stuffed squid with roe and more. The higher priced sets include toro belly, Botan Shrimps and scallops.Absolutely another of my favorite Japanese restaurant. Love the food but the service is pretty bad. The female wait staff reluctantly gave us a chair to put all our bags but reminded us that she'd have to take it back if there are customers. And the restaurant was half full. Meh. Well, for good sashimi and fuss free eating, i'll put up with it. Filling the tummy is more important. Just a little amazed at how un-princessy i am these days. Hur."

It was really good, fatty and fresh. The next two times I came here, I got the salmon bento set. The salmon was fresh, and the grilled salmon slab was generous, but the fish was slighty overcooked and dry. The miso was tasteless, the chawanmushi was okay, but at 30 bucks, I had expected a better flavor. Sukiyaki was pretty good. Ordered ikura oroshi and it came as a mouthful of salmon roe over radish. The salmon roe was not fresh and the portion was ridiculously small for 9 bucks. So this restaurant started out great and became not so great. Never had the chirashi so I can't comment on that, but I hope that they will improve on their quality of raw seafood they serve, specifically the salmon roe."

I'm not sure what that is but it came with a mound of briyani rice with a chicken drumstick hidden inside.

Some of the highlight dishes include the Roast Duck, Suckling Pig and my personal favourite is the Mango and Coconut dessert. Served in a coconut, the coconut juice is made into a sorbet that lined the base within the coconut. Then there's a scoop of rich and creamy mango ice cream. Topping the ice cream is frozen mango crush with a layer of oats sprinkled all over.To fully enjoy this dish, once should dig their spoon all the way to the bottom so that each scoop has a sample of each layer of ingredients. The taste when put into your mouth is like a burst of celebration.Don't forget to try their sampler of dimsum too! Served as an individual serving, when the platter arrives, it's a complete instagram moment. It is slightly pricier than a regular cantonese restaurant but still affordable."

We went during lunch, and it was fairly quiet. Perhaps it's because they're kinda the new kid on the block, and the CBD crowd hasn't realized that there's an awesome lunch to be had here.Although the set lunches were affordable ($15++) they didn't really appeal to us. The entrees are portioned for 2-3 people, so we decided to just order a few and share. To start, we had papadum, which was served with 3 different chutneys, all delish. We then ordered the palak paneer, butter chicken, and rogan josh. Again, all of it was well done, and the butter chicken was definitely my fave- tender chicken, super creamy sauce. Add in their fragrant biryani rice and all was well in the world!What surprised me was the naan, specifically the Kashmiri one. How I've never tried it before is beyond me, but I'm glad Josh T. ordered it because now I'm hooked. For the uninitiated, it's flatbread with dried fruit, nuts, and herbs- when it's served fresh out of the oven it's ommmmmgahhhh so good.I loved the ambiance (contemporary soft rock Indian music in the background) and the upscale decor; it's the perfect setting for a business lunch or a girl's outing. They've been promoting their lounge on the second floor, which also comes with a sweet ladies night deal (complimentary glass of mojito or bubbly, and a free bottle of bubbly with a booking for 5 ladies and an order of 5 mains.) For our group of 10 and the small discount, we paid about $20 per person. I wouldn't mind revisiting with my gal pals in the future!"

I thought they were always crowded because it's a small space with a couple tables (which is true), but they are efficient at getting people seated, taking orders and clearing tables that the turnover is still pretty fast. So that says something about the food, which I have to give it a try. And I've been back since!My visits have always been during non-peak period, so I can't talk about the wait times. My orders come pretty fast, usually for two people, I will get a deluxe ramen and a plain ramen to share. The deluxe version comes with 3 pieces of char siu, while the plain version comes with just 1, so we get to have 2 slices each. The first time we got 2 deluxe orders, it was too much meat and too filling for us. I won't be the first to say that I had my doubts when I glanced through the menu looking for a pork based soup. I was so certain I'm going to order that, but that doesn't exist in Marutama. Their specialty is the chicken soup, which they do perfectly. Not too heavy and not overly flavored, though it is a tad salty, it is good. I would rank it among the top 5 places for ramen. Love their egg and the ramen. The egg is not included in the ramen so you have to add it separately. There is fried garlic slices on every table. I enjoy adding some to the ramen, it adds a nice touch of fragrance to the ramen soup which I truly enjoy. My mum, on the other hand, prefers the natural taste of the soup without the added garlic. On my visits I noticed many other people ordering their dumplings as appetizers. For just 2 of us the ramen is more than enough, so the next time I visit I will want to introduce more people to Marutama so we can all try some of their appetizers, especially those dumplings."

There are 2 camps for ramen - chicken based soup and the traditional milky pork bone based soup. If you prefer things less porky, you will like Marutama Ramen. I'm not really a pork person, so the ramen here is right up my alley. I like the chicken based soup which is still cooked till it is quite thick. It is also not as salty as the usual tonkutsu based soup. The noodle is springy, some liken it to the texture as being similar to the kolo noodle in Sarawak. I always like the ramen here since it opened several years ago but have not been back till very recently. I am happy to report that the ramen is still good, but the noodles could be better. It got soggier and soft the longer I left it in the soup, so maybe you need to eat the noodle asap type. The one slice of char siu that comes with the ramen is tender and melting soft. Add the fried garlic chips and you get an aromatic bowl of noodles. You need to add on the egg which is simply divine. It is still the best place to get a flavorful half boiled egg with a wobbly soft egg white with a barely cooked egg yolk which will ooze out. Yummy! Even though there are more ramen places with such egg around, somehow they don't seemed to get the timing right to get the perfect soft boiled egg. Another side dish which is to die for even though the portion size keeps reducing, making it quite dear to order now is the char siu. Somehow they managed to make it crispy on the edges and retain the tenderness in the meat. Squeeze the wedge of lemon over the char siu and then dip it in the chili (optional as eating it plain is good enough). It is just so delicious you will just want to gobble the whole thing up and not share with your dining companions."

As for the broth, I crave for it - but do take note that the ice water is placed next to you for good reason. While it hit home, my companion and I gulped down cups of water post-lunch as it left us pretty thirsty. That said, I would still drain the broth entirely. The tamago (extra $1.50) is done perfectly - soft on the inside but not so soft till it oozes out; you can still use chopsticks to pick it out to slowly savour it.

The ramen that they use is light and springy, and is slightly hard in texture so it doesn't soak up too much of the soup broth that it comes served in. Their portion is also exactly right for me; not too much where it goes to waste, but not too little where after I finish the noodles, there is still half a bowl of broth left. For the boyfriend, he does order the additional $2 worth of ramen if he's feeling peckish, so that is a good available option as well! The soup broth is my favourite part of the meal, it's thick and not too salty when coupled with the ramen. It comes clear even if you order the spicy version, because the spice is cooked within the soup, not added as a seasoning which I especially appreciate. But be warned since the chilli taste doesn't kick in until a good 5 large slurps or so. They also serve the most well cooked 'hot spring eggs', where they manage to serve eggs that are cooked on the outside but soft and melty in the yolk every single time I've dined there. Really good stuff! The ambience is also really nice and quiet, with a slightly dim vintage Japanese feel."

For all their ramen dishes, you can choose whether you want it spicy or not.I haven't tried most of their side dishes but the gyoza is really nice so you might want to get that as a side dish to share.

I had the spicy ramen, and they got the spicy just right. Spicy ramen sometimes doesn't have enough spice, or it gets so tongue numbing by the end (since its soupy). Didn't happen here for me, it builds up to just  a slight tingling. Brownie points for this. Of course, we all have different tolerances for spicy, and someone who doesn't order spicy ramen may well give this 3*.Like a previous reviewer mentioned, the first thing you'd notice is that the chicken soup base was undesirably thick, rather than light in texture/taste. It was also a bit saltier than I would have liked. But considering this is Singapore, that's not surprising. And while a soup is certainly important, it was not bad, and at least they got everything else right.It's $12 a bowl, but DO add the seasoned egg ($1.50?). Gosh, that was perfect. Cooked just nice, and the yolk was... just wow. I usually remove my yolk but I wished I had more of this. That was the highlight of my meal, and why I'm rounding off the 3.5* to a 4*! There's also seaweed topping (I found it a nice texture mix with the ramen) and meat, and the latter had just enough flavour. There wasn't much of it though :PLast, we were seated almost immediately on a weekday 12.30pm, but I heard it was relatively empty that day, and wait is usually 10-15min."

The entire restaurant staff immediately welcome us with loud Japanese greetings. There are also many Japanese elements such as the numerous Japanese calligraphy paintings on the Japanese walls and the wooden furniture.Food - Marutama Ramen is known for its unique chicken soup base, the ""Toripaitan Soup"". This is a variation from the traditional soup bases of Shoyu (""soy sauce""), Miso, Shio (""salt"") and Tonkotsu (""pork bone"").Marutama Ramen - Thin Ramen noodles served in hot chicken broth with a piece of tender Char Siew (sliced roast pork). The char siew is tender and tastes decent, but not spectacular. Yummy chicken broth which goes well with the ramen noodles, savoury but not overly-rich.Katsuo Syouyu Ramen - Ramen with Shoyu soup base is slightly saltier than the Marutama Ramen. The soup base is quite flavourful and tasty but personally, I prefer the chicken soup base of Marutama Ramen.Overall, it is Yummy Ramen Noodles Served in Savoury Chicken Broth!The price is reasonable, and service is good and consistent as well.

First time's a charm; my subsequent visits featured weak broth and soggy noodles. I don't think many people know but there's a small private space that can seat 8-10 comfortable.

On the plus side, it was fragrant and spicy for those who like or don't mind thick broths. My friends also got the vegetable ramen which they didn't like as even the soup base tasted strongly of vegetables. Cha-shu is an additional $4 and egg is an additional $1.50 which adds up to about $25 per person with service charge.

The noodles is one of the other reasons I keep coming back for more, it's done very al-dente and the noodles are like your ""you mian"", thinner strands.The tamago are done to perfection.

It may not be synonymous with your last meal but a dish that draws you into having. I have a few and most if not all, are humble & carb-laden. Today, do not expect surprises as you probably guess it right. A connection to the past and brings back fond memories of my late grandfather - his favorite Dim Sum, Char Siew Pau (Chinese bun filled with roasted pork).Originating from the Guangdong province of China (my grandfather was from China), these Chinese buns were made from milled rice flour, stuffed with diced BBQ pork tenderloin. They are one of the popular dim sum snacks these days and the nostalgic take-away versions are from Tiong Bahru Pau and Teck Kee Tanglin Pau. The buns are mostly steamed  but there are baked alternatives. I am accustomed to the steamed ones since young.The sizable chicken bun is always so gratifying. Without a trace of stickiness on the roof of your hard palate, the skin was marvelously soft and not overly thick. You will find chunks of fresh chicken meat with a touch of ginger, soy sauce and a bit of Chinese rice wine. Nope, no egg was stuffed in there unlike other places where Big steamed buns do. Without that extra calories, I could eat them with ease.The memories of my grandfather starts flowing when the stall-holder pickup that tongue-scalding BBQ buns from the steam tray. It was a complete solace. The act of unfolding the skin to reveal the glazed ingredients was equally heart throbbing. With the roasted pork so well browned and glossy looking, I couldn't wait any longer to taste the sweet oyster seasoning in the meat. The candied mixture add so much flavor to the tender pork, every time with the right consistency. Watching the laving juices wetting my fingers and dripping down my wrist is visually appealing. Did you feel the joy? I will never stop at the savory even though the sweet ones seem to attract the older crowd more. My grandfather was one of the avid fan of the bean-paste filled buns. The shiny smooth white exterior hides a pool of creamy red bean paste. For a less sugary variation, go for the lotus paste which came with robust lotus seeds flavor that was flowy as well. It was mind rupturing each time I sank my teeth into the fluffy bun to penetrate the fillings. Truly unimaginable."

There's also a theatrical element to the experience, as ingredients are openly displayed while chefs prepare them in front of you. If you drink, then they have a great sake program along with a limited variety of wines and beers. Dinner sets are available ($88 // $135 // $188), and can be coupled with a la carte items. I'd recommend this place for dates, small groups, and for business. Not a lot of robataya setups in Singapore, so it's a nice change of pace.

This was a rather underwhelming experience - reserved chefs, restrained flavours, hollow room. Fairly good produce. The grilled fish was under cooked unfortunately. Worth the price? Nope.Would I return? Nope.Worth it for someone who hasn't been to a robataya to come? Uncertain.

The other new kid on the block is Tamashii Robataya, which i heard great reviews about and so i went with high expectations, thinking it would blow me away like Teppei.Dinner sets are priced at $88, $128 and $168. There's also the a la carte and omakase option. We decided to try the $128 (7 course) and $168 (8 course) dinner. The difference is in the quality of ingredients and for the 8 course, there's uni with caviar and the signature Wagyu Donburi.Appetizers. My favorite was the tofu with century egg sauce and tobiko roe.Yaki Yasai Moriwase. Grilled assorted seasonable vegetable. I'm becoming a fan of roasted onions and they are best paired with a umami miso paste.The Plat de résistance has to be the Wagyu Donburi! A well marbled buttery Saga A4 beef striploin sits on top a fragrant marinated short-grain rice. Mix all that runny onsen egg with truffle oil and shaved black truffles in and every mouth will send you to beef heaven. Certainly the best dish of the night. Goes for $55 a bowl if you order it a la carte. The Kashira Donburi, a grilled black pig pork cheeks paled in comparison to the Wagyu Donburi. The pork was too bland for my liking. Both soups were bland. I found it a waste to use tuna belly in a soup. The clam soup from the $128 menu was just bleargh. Was i impressed by the food served at Tamashii Robataya? Frankly i was hoping to be blown away but sadly it was underwhelming. I may go back for the Wagyu Donburi but that's about that. If you'd like to try, I'd say go for their lunch sets.

The queue moves at a fair enough pace I suppose, but sometimes it's actually almost physically intimidating to walk into that dense a crowd.That all said though, it's easy to see why there's such a long queue. The ingredients here are fresh, and I love the degree of customisation. I'm a big fan of bacon bits and blue cheese dressing, avocado and baby spinach leaves. For a heavier salad, throw in some baby potatoes and roasted pumpkin, and top it all off with raisins for a little sweetness.Those options not to your liking? There's also celery, mushrooms, three-bean mix, almond flakes, pasta, cous cous, capers, gherkins, feta, and that's just a quarter the main feeds! You pick 6 main feeds for a rabbit size ($8), add two supplementary feeds and it becomes a zebra size ($10). Insider tip? The poached chicken is the only ""meat"" that's NOT a Prime feed, so if you're saving on cash and want meat, that's your best bet. The Salad Shop also offers a variety of homemade dressings, and every one that I've tried has been absolutely awesome. Tip: the order process goes like this, 1) pick up an order chit near the entrance, tick off the 'feeds' you want and remember to mark if you're dining in or out in the top left hand corner. 2) head over to the corner and 'place your order' before... 3) paying at the counter underneath the menu boardJust saying this because the first time I went there I had no idea how things worked. :("

I think it was the textural contrast of crispy batter + soft oyster + creamy mayo that worked. there was far too much mayonnaise on it though - but we easily schmeared it away.the kagoshima katsu toji was tender and moist and not-too-fatty - delicious; this was part of their seasonal menu (that I think will be available for a month more).we rounded up the meal with a grilled salmon head - this went down easily enough with a big helping of grated radish and lemon. so - a good dinner, made cheaper by a discount as members and vouchers (a result of loyal patronage) - we left both full and happy."

Paris Baguette,B1 One Raffles Place Singapore Singapore ,,,,[],Li T.,dJzKwp5k65MK3R_qn4Xpow,"Singapore, Singapore",3,9/26/2015,"Bread is the first thing I think of when it comes to Paris Baguette Cafe so I was quite surprised to learn that it has launched 4 new bing su. Or maybe it isn't such a surprise since Paris Baguette is still a Korean franchise. The Matcha Bingsu ($12), which is a sizeable good-for-sharing portion loaded generously with sweet red beans, turned out to be an enjoyable one. The flakes might not be as fine as Oma Spoon but this is less sweet and there is enough red beans to last till the very end.On the other hand, the cakes did not fare as well as the Bingsu. The Foret Noire lacked the necessary moisture and intensity of cacao notes, making it quite an unpalatable and expensive cake at $7.50. Fortunately, the Double Fromage, a construction of baked cheesecake layered with cheese mousse, was the saving grace. Some say there is a sense of de ja vu as it resembled Le Tao's version. For the looks, maybe. But for the taste, this has a long way to go."

Honestly I did. And while I do feel that the food at Hachi is definitely worth 3 stars, the entire dining experience, the price, service, the evening was best summed up as ""Meh"". I asked my date to pick between ""Meh/Average/Good"" and she too summed it up as Meh.So just to be clear. The food here is THREE STARS. 3*s. The overall experience? Meh (2 stars)I found the setup of the restaurant a little odd, the counter isn't really ideal for people to sit and interact with the chefs, there's a height differential that makes it a bit awkward, and moreover a good part of the counter is used as a clearing station for dirty dishes. Personally I always eye the counter when I expect a Omakase experience, I think I've been conditioned to expect the counter experience to be more personalable. Before we begun, the waitress asked us if we had any dining restrictions... and mentioned oysters. Now I generally really don't like oysters. In all my oyster experiences, I've only not gagged once, so with a bit of apprehension I said I'd have the oyster, raw, just to see how it'd go. My date said that she'd eat anything just ""no wasabi"".And so we begun. The first course was a delicate green bean... curd/mousse in dashi gel with salmon roe. Salty, a little sweet from the pea, it was interesting and quite tasty. The platter of four starters was decent as well, my date liked it more than I did. We then had a scallop, partially seared, wrapped in bacon, served on sweetcorn. I didn't get this dish at all. The scallops were sweet, fresh, and actually quite delicate. They were quite overwhelmed by the bacon. The sweetcorn? Similar flavour profile to the scallops, and while a nice contrast in texture, seemed an odd addition. The assorted sashimi platter was fresh, there was a good variety with mackeral, sea bream, flounder, and yellowtail... BUT. The wasabi wasn't fresh, and okay, I don't always expect fresh wasabi, I realise it's kind of an indulgence... AND the soy sauce tasted cheap. I can't explain this to you really. I've never, ever noticed soy sauce ""not meeting my expectations"", but last night, at Hachi, I did. I asked my date if it was only me, and she said it wasn't as fragrant as she expected. Now, $120 isn't a lot of money for a multi-course omakasa, but the little things. The little things need to right for the entire dining experience to be awesome. We then had a bamboo shoot dobin mushi (I LOVE dobin mushi and this one was average), followed by the highlight of the evening, the oyster. It was fresh, sweet, succulent, not at all chewy, and served with spring onions and ponzu sauce. Delicious. The next course was Tempura.... alright. One of the items was a little heavy and a touch oily, but again, not bad, just not amazing. What WAS ""bad"" was that the wait staff had to ask us (and the table next to us) numerous times ""what course"" we were at. Like, they were just randomly throwing out dishes and couldn't keep track. I say randomly, because we noticed that the table next to us received courses in a different order... and almost had their oysters forgotten.After that it was sushi. Now remember what my date said about wasabi? You guessed it. Forgotten. They were quick and willing to change it, and apologetic, but I mean. If you're asking about dietary restrictions, TAKE NOTE OF THEM. They also didn't bother to explain what fish was on the sushi, so I can't tell you much about it. The seared Wagyu beef was a little on the cold side, barely room temperature, which was odd because the vegetables it was served with were nice and hot, likely fresh off the teppan. For some reason, though every other table received their miso soup and rice with a side bowl of pickles, we didn't get any pickles (which we love, so it matters ok?). There were also momotaro tomatoes as an earlier course... but I found theirs a little odd tasting. I think they're marinated in something, and I didn't like it much.The miso soup is worth mentioning though. The use of onions gave the soup a more complex flavour, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dessert? Black sesame ice cream that was... too sweet and not really ""sesame-y"" enough. The sesame flavour was a... lacking, and instead it had more of a creamy sweetness. Not... bad, but I've definitely had much much better black sesame ice cream.And there it all is. Food that was, in parts, brilliant, interesting, or top-notch, while in other parts, mediocre, uninspired, or sloppy. Service, for most of the evening was friendly, earnest, and jovial... but rather inept. They felt scattered and a little directionless, and maybe needed a good floor manager to bring everything together.For the now though, I'm give Hachi 2 stars with a heavy heart. They're obviously trying to bring the omakase experience to a slightly more affordable level... but unless someone else tells me that my experience was unusual and an outlier, I'm unlikely to go back."

The waiter (who turned out to be the manager) rushed us to our seats, didn't know the fish included in the sashimi special (""It is just the fresh fish.  I don't know, it changes.""), and didn't tell us the first two dishes of our omakase.  This is the FIRST time I have ever had omakase and had no idea what I am eating.  I would have completely blown up at him had another waitress not taken over.  She was cordial and actually informed me about what I was eating.The food:The dishes here were light, delicate, and well balanced.  The fish broth for tofu was rich and flavorful while the wagyu beef was well cooked and seasoned well.  I enjoyed the freshness of the raw oyster and sushi as well as the subtle flavors in the rice.  The standard sesame ice cream was fine.So would I go back for 4 star food and 2 star service?  Maybe.  But Hachi really needs to train/get rid of the manager and step up its service.  Once it does that, it could be a solid, go to Japanese restaurant in Singapore."

The subsequent plate of skins never came. When questioned, they said they already served the skin of the whole duck for us. Never in my life have I ordered a WHOLE Peking Duck that yields only one small plate of skin. Then came the Duck Fried Rice that was supposed to be cooked using the meat from the Peking Duck.

They have a breakfast menu as well as a lunch menu. They also have cakes, tarts and muffins on display. However, it seems that most people were there for the coffee.My friend had a triple deck roast chicken sandwich and a chicken pie. The chicken sandwich was nothing special, just three slices of wholemeal sandwich bread with roast chicken and the usual garnishing. The chicken pie was not bad. I had a tuna baguette which was also very normal, so food-wise, it's really not impressive. As I've mentioned though, the  coffee was really good.

On the coffee front, Dimbulah is certainly very much Australian in that the staff is friendly and its coffees are brilliant. I've only had the flat whites here twice and they've been consistently delicious. Prices are reasonable for Singapore at $4.50. The only let-down though is that there's no latte art. I know it'll vanish the moment I drink my beverage, or, what's more likely, get destroyed by the time I get back to my office, but... still! Presentation does count, and for that, I'll take off half a star, only Qype doesn't do half stars, so I have to take off one whole star so as to distinguish Dimbulah from the other cafes with great coffee. For food, Dimbulah offers sandwiches, wraps and cakes. This particular outlets also sells soups from Saybons.

The offerings are  basic - $4.90 for mixed greens with 5 sides. Pay $1-1.50 for proteins like chicken or sausages. The food quality is ok in that you can only pick mixed greens for your base (no baby spinach or pure romaine) and for proteins, I would only eat the broiled/BBQ/cajun chicken, smoked duck or tuna and skip the processed stuff like crab sticks/surimi and cheesy chicken sausage. By the way, will the person who invented cheesy chicken sausages please...apologize to humanity and go do something more useful? I mean really. Nachos-type liquid cheese in your sausage? Ewww.Anyway the prices are great if you eat a lot (like me). I managed to assemble a salad with high protein/calcium veg like broccoli and kidney beans, got my vitamins from  peppers and beta carotene from carrots. Would like to see more variety but I guess you can't complain much for the price. Most shops charge $2-3 for chicken and only Saladstop and Fresh+ offer tuna as a generic ""free"" side. Lastly, the aunty putting the salad together is grouchy and speedy, just the way I like it at the hawker centre. Moves the queue along and I get to eat pronto :)"

Basically, everything and anything on Japanese food can be found on it. Variety is an understatement. It feels like several popular Japanese restaurant chain all rowed into one.

Go to it of course! One lunch time, we did just that. It was a crowded place, no less than I'd expect from a place as hyped up (albeit by my friend) as this. It was a place that to an extent did actually bring me back to Vietnam - the colour scheme, the bustle, the feeling like I'm not quite in the east, but yet not quite in the west...it's weird and I can't quite describe it, but I remember having been in places like this in Vietnam.The food did not at all disappoint. I was tempted to get the pho, but I just had a pretty nice bowl the day before, so I decided to go for something dry instead. Cue high fives for the amazing decision when my bowl was delivered. Crowned with two fresh prawns, a smattering of fried shallots, slices of pork so tender and a nice handful of greens, my bowl of perfectly cooked glass noodles was just the most excellent eat I'd had in a while. What made it so good was of course the sauce it was in, seductively sweet, yet tastefully savoury as well. Finished every little strand, just so I could maximise the sauce given. It wasn't the cheapest bowl at $11.50, but my word was it worth every single cent.Note that they do tax your bills and charge you 20 cents for the wet towels, whether you use it or not...so use it! Also be warned that the noodles come with parsley, so if you are not a fan of that devil plant (like me), don't forget to ask for them to take it far far away from you!"

The only redeeming factor was the beef was fairly decent. But the broth was like something out of a can and many of my noodles were hard. I'm a pho junkie. I know a good pho. That was not a good pho.

They weren't clean slices as I would expect but some of them were chunks of beef. The noodles were the thicker rice noodle variety and they tasted good. Not too soggy, not too firm, just right. The soup wasn't very flavorful. It had a lot of oil in it as you can see from my picture but there wasn't any depth to the flavor of the broth. It's not pho if it doesn't have depth darnit! The dish comes with your normal accoutrement of bean sprouts and lime slices but boy do I miss Sriracha!The third item in the lunch set is your choice of a drink or dessert.

The Pho broth was a little bland and the noodles were too soft, but the hot sauce, hoisin sauce, and coriander turned it into a pretty satisfying meal. The pork spring rolls were interesting. Small and pleasantly crispy; extra meaty, so a little greasy. They did a great job with the egg. I don't remember what it was called on the menu, but it was essentially a vegetable omelet. Quite nice. The service was good and they were generous with refills in the condiment plate.

For the price of $6.50, I thought the amount of mixed veg was pathetic. The bun was not even toasted, or Perhaps it was but I can't decipher. A nicely toasted warm bun with a slight crispy edge would have made the bun a much more worthy one.The pulled pork tasted alright for the first two bites and then the overly sweet and salty BBQ sauce started to take effect. It was an experience of the-next-mouth-tasting-worse-than-the-last. I was really on the verge of abandoning my lunch after 5 bites, but I was also taught not to waste food so I made myself finish the meal.I didn't order any drinks with it but what a mistake that was cos the meat was so salty, I was dying of thirst (maybe there's use of MSG? i dunno!).

I split the Hungarian sausage ($5.50) and the pulled pork on bread ($6.50) with a friend. Portion sizes are okay for the price, but quality isn't. The sausage was quite bland and its texture was dry. It came with yellow rice which was so-so. The pulled pork was marginally better but the bread it came with -- a burger bun -- is not worth ingesting. The meat was soft enough and the sauce sufficiently flavoured, but overall not impressive.Note that the ""hot tea"" item on the menu is chamomile by default, which the menu doesn't state.

(We were famished!)So the hostess took the menu and asked""Do you wanna sit inside or outside?""We were a little confused cos we are not sure where the ""outside"" was and how it's like vs inside as it was our first time. An experience server will start giving suggestion to the kind of experience we will enjoy seated inside vs outside. But this hostess only got impatient.With a stern face, she pointed to the glass door and said, ""Outside is that way.""We decided to sit ""outside"" and the hostess led us to the alfresco seated area. The views that were available were either that of marina bay or towards Fullerton. We walked to the Fullerton side but decided to settle down at the Marina bay view instead so asked to be seated at the other side.The hostess gave us a black face while leading us to the other table impatiently. My friend asked if there were any other promotions, she said blankly, ""No. If you want free drinks you can go to Empire next door.""She left the menu on the table and walked out on us.Every time she spoke, it as if she spoke in a condescending tone. If we want to spend, we will and we can. But we won't waste our dollars on bad service and as customers, I will be very silly to spend money at a place where we are clearly not welcome and pay to have someone give me attitude. All we wanted was a nice, quiet place with a view to get our minds off our long exhausting day at work. With that objective, we left the restaurant immediately. I don't really care if your food is good. Your service sucks and it sucks big time. The other servers could only stare in surprise when we walked out and didn't even bother to ask if they could assist or what's the issue. The hostess was no where in sight."

While many may say that the toast or the eggs are not very special or that the food is expensive but one of the biggest draws for me is the convenience of the drinks to go. They are pretty efficient with the dual counters and dual queue system which enables the crazy, hungry and thirsty crowd at Raffles Place to get their drinks to go.The other big plus for me is that the cashier has somehow identified me as a regular and remember what my usual order is (I tend to buy large amounts of honey lemon drinks to go) and she is ever cheerful and helpful, sometimes giving me good recommendation for new drinks I'd like to try.The honey lemon here comes with 2 slices of lemon and a very generous amount of honey to sweeten things up. I wouldn't say they use great honey but when you do try to press the lemons farther before drinking, the sourness from the lemon slices and the sweetness from the honey comes to a nice balance.As a few others pointed out, if price is an issue, do go to Golden Shoe for better priced drinks and food. But the service here plus the convenience and pretty good speed of fulfilling their orders would keep the crowds coming.As a side note, they do have a main competitor Teahut which also makes excellent honey lemon, but they tend to be a little generous with their honey and lemons."

Maybe the place was too small to have a proper kitchen? It seemed like the ""hot"" food was just being heated up before serving. The corn fritters were more like fluffy pancakes with corn in them. Definitely not what I imagined them to be, and certainly not like those at Bills in Sydney. Hey, Jamaica Blue is from Australia after all. Can't blame me for the correlation. With the texture like pancakes, I wish there was some sauce to pour over the ""fritters"". It was just so dry that I actually resorted to sprinkling white sugar over them as if I was eating prata like a child. It was much better with the sugar.

I ordered the bacon and egg sandwich while my wife had the ""avocado smash"", which appeared to be basically the same thing with fresh avocado. I thought the bacon was excellent and really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich. At about $13 it was pretty reasonable my Singapore standards as well. Since we had almost the whole place to ourselves, we got excellent service. There are only about 6 tables indoors but there lots outdoors. Was frankly surprised that no one else was there. My only (very minor) complaint was that the is significantly different than the one online (we had scoped it out before heading down).

Was also looking for the laksa ramen but couldn't find it in the menu.It took a long while for a waiter to appear to take my order for Original Tsukemen after pressing the Call button repeatedly and it took more than 15 minutes before ramen was served.The thick noodle has excellent al dente type elasticity and was accompanied by a lime for squeezing onto the noodle prior to dipping. The problem with lime is seeds tend to get onto the noodle easily. The dipping sauce was lukewarm and had some pork broth/seafood complexity, slightly salty but did not taste good with the lime-aided noodle. A single piece of chashu was positioned on top of the noodle and it was dry, bland and barely tender. Ajitama was served whole with hard overcooked mooncake yolk within. Tap water costs an additional 50 cents.Overall, the dish was a major disappointment when compared with other tsukemen. For instance, the ramen at Rokurinsha (started by another disciple of the same master) Haneda airport is a much more delicious version of this genre."

Tiger beer was S$7.90.  yelp.com/biz_photos/no-s…  The waitstaff was as warm as the cold platter.I can't really give it two stars because according to the star ratings, I haven't had better chilli crab (this is my first), so A-OK it is.Next time, I'm going to brave it, put on a bib and eat some chilli crab at a hawker stall."

For a restaurant that specializes in serving crab, did no one think that the patrons might need a real napkin or two?  You are also proved with the most poorly designed crab cracker ever made.  Hard to imagine messing up such a simple device.  This restaurant must have bought the cheapest crab crackers made in the world. The service was indifferent.  Not friendly at all.  No interest or concern for the customers was ever shown.A crab, a small sweet sour pork dish and a very small plate of asparagus cost over $200.  To the price of the meal, add the frustration of eating with no thought given to your comfort and one is left feeling ripped off and very angry.  You also get charged for your glass of tap water, by the way."

Although the black fungus was crunchy, it was lacking of flavours.The crispy fish skin was everyone's favourite as it was light and crispy.The prawn roll looked like crispy yam roll, filled with crunchy prawn filling.2nd course : Double Boiled Black Chicken SoupThe soup was a way too salty for most people. The meat of the black chicken was quite tender.3rd course : Baked Herbal DuckThe meat was quite tender and filled with tender soft, melt in the mouth chestnuts.4th course : Braised Seafood with vegetablesThere was clams, fish maws, shiitake mushrooms, whelks, cabbage, and dried scallops. The dish was well braised.5th course : Five Spice RollsThere was way too much onion in the rolls, and lacking of the crunchy texture from water chestnuts. It was served with a spicy squid salad.6th course : Steamed Sea BassThe fish was steamed with soya sauce, and topped with a meat and preserved vegetable mixture. The meat was firm and juicy.7th course : Steamed Herbal PrawnsThe prawns were juicy but can barely tasted the herbal part.8th course : Braised Pork Belly PauThe braised pork belly was quite oily, and could do with a longer braising time as the fat still did not have the melt in the mouth texture yet. It was served with pipping hot bun.9th course : Mango PuddingWish there were mango cubes in it. Lacking of mango flavour.Service was uneven. My dining partner who was having vegetarian, got left out of one course. One staff remembered but served her with a vegetable dish with dried scallop in it.

There are private rooms if you wish to have that. Apparently this place has been around for years, and is popular with the older folks who remembered going there for wedding banquets and other occasions. Maybe they are better for their dishes as I saw many tables ordered that instead of dim sum stuff. I find the dim sum very average. If you are used to the Cantonese style or the more refined and delicate taste of dim sum, this will be a huge disappointment. I place them in the same category of Swee Choon, Red Star and Mouth Restaurant. The only items I like are the century egg pork porridge (looks small and plain but is actually tasty) and BBQ pork buns (soft fluffy bun with plenty of nicely charred and moreish BBQ pork). The fried rice lacks the wok hei flavor and is quite tasteless. My nephews who are ""fan tong"" (love rice a lot) basically shunned it. The XO fried carrot cake is also not that great (Taste Paradise does a better version). The dessert is also mediocre. Another item which seemed popular is the vinegar pork trotter which did not show up. It was sold out but the staff did not inform us when we ordered. The service is average, typical of such old school Chinese restaurant. It can be better, and it did get better for those who know the people there."

And that's a hard prize to get, considering I'm not very fussy with my food.What surprised me was that even though this place is located in Clarke Quay, neither of the 2 staff working that day knew how to speak English. They couldn't have been Singaporean. The trouble began when I ordered one of their promotions, which was on a huge sign next to the cashier, and they didn't know what I was talking about. The worst was when I was asking for water, and they didn't even know what that meant. They kept pointing to this cooler that had ice in it, and after 5 minutes they realized what I was asking for and it turned out the bottled water was still in a box. On the floor. Unpacked. And then there was the food. I ordered teriyaki chicken and ebi bento box. The ebi was edible; the teriyaki chicken was just fried chicken that didn't even have any sauce on it. I don't know if they just didn't take my order correctly or if they think that this type of chicken is passable as teriyaki. The pickled veggies were a huge joke (there was one slice of pickle that looked old), the rice was over-cooked, and it didn't even have black sesame seeds sprinkled on, as pictured in the photo.I couldn't finish my food. It was just so bad that I figured for $5.90 it's not worth enduring and ended up buying food elsewhere.I totally understand if I were in some heartland area in a hawker centre and they didn't speak English there, but this is Clarke Quay, a very tourist area, you guys. If they were trolling and pretending not to speak English when they could? Completely unacceptable. Avoid."

We ordered up a storm, and while the food had a homely feel to it, it's more of your bf/gf/hubby/wifey whizzing around in the kitchen vibe as opposed to your nonna/ah ma/nenek's culinary magic. If you know what I mean. The nosh was functional, and aside from the sambal belachan that packed a good heat, everything else was ho hum. The tahu telor - like my pithy colleague, who attended a wedding the previous day and was served the same dish, noted - tasted like tahu telor. There aren't exactly many permutations available for something that's esentially egg and tahu with its life fried the heck out of it. Sambal kang kong was ok, many stalks included so those who only eat leaves beware. The green curry chicken was lemak enough to narrow your arteries by an inch; bad if you're watching your waistline but good if you want to die happy. There's a $20+ buffet going on during dinner and Saturday lunch so it's great for those who like variety. Service is fast and efficient, though you'll need to point out that your water needs topping up. Staff are happy to be around and help you with items you need, and fetch extra belachan or rice.Will I be back? Doubt so. It's a bit too out of the way and the food a bit too lacklustre to warrant a trip out. Sure, I really like the service, but you can't eat service, y'know?"

A couple of years later there are now more than 20 cafes, retail outlets and bread corners across Singapore. This cafe in Raffles place is catering mainly to the lunch crowd I feel. But if you want a sandwhich, the sandwhich shop in hitachi tower beats SwissBake handsdown. It's important to buy things SwissBake is good at. Like pastries and whole breads. The cakes look good and are affordable, the bread is fresh and smells nice. They also have this amazingly refreshing drink called Rivella. Service here is a bit rushed, but still proffessional and customer-oriented. Ambience is modern, clean and ok only. Operating hoursWeekday: 7.00am - 8.00pm Saturday: 8.00am - 4.00pm"

Cash/Nets are accepted. Credit cards are not at the moment even though I see credit card terminal/paywave in there.At the entrance, it says to wait there to be seated. I was asked to place my order at the counter before taking my seat. I saw others being ushered to their tables and being given menus. A bit disconcerting when you are not given time to peruse the menu and have to place the order almost immediately when you are standing at the cashier counter. I decided on the set which is basically add $2 to the noodles to get a side dish of fried spring rolls and coffee/tea. I chose the medium beef slices noodles.For those looking for sriracha sauce, Ngon does not stock it. They have no idea what it is. Another diner and I asked for it and the staff was clueless. They only have cut chili padi, a tomato-chili mix sauce and the sweet chili dipping sauce for spring rolls. As it happened, the owner (a Vietnamese from Hanoi and he has never heard of sriracha sauce) was there and we suggested to him maybe he could stock sriracha sauce in future. So hopefully sriracha sauce will be available soon. Ngon does have their homemade ""hoi sin"" sauce which was pretty good. The broth in the pho was very light and may suit those who preferred a lighter taste. The sliced onions, bean sprouts and basil leaves were served in the pho, not on a side plate. Slice wedges of limes were kept in containers on the table. The noodles were broken, not in long strands. The fried spring rolls were a bit oily and could be crispier and browner in appearance. I would prefer a shallower saucer or dipping sauce bowl as the current one is a bit hard to get to, but this would be picky.The coffee was very strong and only slightly sweet. In fact, I could hardly taste the condensed milk in it.Until I know they stock sriracha, I doubt I will head back there any time soon. The food is not that memorable."

I had ordered the set meal which comprised of ''Pork Chop'' dry noodles, 2 huge spring rolls and a tall glass of tea shown on the menu.The actual food upon arrival was a stark difference. The tea came in a small cup and the spring rolls were in fact, mini rolls. However, the most shocking was the noodle dish. There was no ''pork chop'' but thin slices of cured (or preserved) pork slices that were so salty and dry. Almost like pork jerky. As much as tried to, I was simply unable to consume beyond 2 pieces. In the end, I ended up only having the plain noodles and left the pork slices untouched.I contacted the outlet next day requesting to speak with the manager in charge. A female staff answered, shouted that she and the outlet are very busy and that manager was not present. She then ended the call abruptly. For that set meal that cost more than $13.00, one could receive better quality food ingredients and service from similar eateries and even from a foodcourt."

The staff will also call out its promotional prices, old school style, instead of having them written on the board or poster. I guess as the place is still new and unless you work in the area, most will not realize One Raffles Place has more or less completed its makeover/renovation and the basement is almost fully operational (only 1 restaurant is not opened yet at this time of writing). Good time to go pick up some sliced cakes (2 for $7) or sandwiches and salad (10% off) for dinner on your way home. The place is also quite empty around that time. Music is no longer of the heavy bass variety but the usual top 40s. Besides the cold stuff, they also serve hot food. I decided to add $5.90 to make it a set. You get to choose 2 options from a list of soup of the day/cake (2 choices) or drinks and others. Complimentary water was available in a corner, together with the cutlery and magazines for browsing.The smoked salmon kraftkorn was really good. The seeds and nuttiness of the bread added a new dimension to a simple regular multi-grain bread. It looked very hard and chewy but it was actually crispy and light. I was surprised. Despite it being ready made and left in the chiller for a while, the veggies were still very fresh, not wilted at all. The pumpkin soup was also good. The hazelnut cake was nice but not mind blowing. That belongs to my list of try once is good enough. I saw a few people having work discussion or meeting in another corner, so I guessed it can be a good place to get away from the office for a while. Others were also working on their lappies."

I've eaten the currywurst and loved it. What irks me is that the shop is as empty  as a broke wallet after a night out on the town and I'm not sure how long it will last.Let's get the food out of the way - this is a shop that sells delicious, grilled hot German sausages and slathers a Heinz curry sauce (kinda sweet) and some curry powder on top. You can even get a bottle of beer if you please (the audacity just cracks me up at lunch... ""why not?"") and some fries to boot, but my poor wallet can only handle A sausage.  It's good though. What I also like are the state of the art facilities and how spanking Germanly clean it is (yes that's a poor pun on germs and the great country). You don't get stalls like that anywhere in Singapore except maybe at Japanese-run ramen shops.So I feel like this review should be a summary of the analysis I've played over and over again in my head while eating at Bratworks, about why this shop is empty:1) The Food Pictures and signage are ALL WRONG - OK if you walk past this stall while deciding what to eat at One Raffles Place, two things jump at you at Bratworks - holy smokes they want $8 for ONE sausage (because if you glance at the menu all you see is $8)...or a set meal consists of a beer (??) and fries for $16. The average lazy  desk bound office worker who imagines that eating alone will get him/her skinny will think ""ewwww beer and carbs?"", while the health conscious ones who actually exercise will be like, ""$8 for a small piece of protein that's filled with I don't know what meat??"" and walk on. Everyone else will feel sad about the lonely sausage sitting next to a small German bun and compare it to the bowl of bak chor mee they were gonna eat anyway and think ""neh, stick with bak chor mee"".I am 99% sure this is what people think when they look at the Bratworks shop and I don't understand why the owners swap out the fries in the damn picture and show some potato slaw or better yet, sauerkraut (hello fermented food movement!!). Beef up the sausage too or chop it up. And if the currywurst is this company's famous food....WHY ISN'T THERE a picture of the delicious pile of chopped up wurst slathered in sauce?! Stick some pop up words next to the food that say ""100% German recipe!"" or "" Only the freshest ground sirloin"" too. Finally, have a catchy tagline that expains what in the world an Imbiss is or why this place is so spanking clean. There's probably like 20 Germans in Raffles Place (and they're all from DB) and 100s of everyone else who doesn't understand what a Malaysian-bird-sounding shop is (that's what I thought an imbiss was until I bothered to google it). Look at Erich's Wuertstelstand, where he made a joke ""The last sausage kiosk before the equator"" and bingo! Everyone knows it sells sausages.2) Pricing - This is the other head scratching thing. So I can't decide if Bratworks is trying to sell sausages as a meal or as a place to have beer and snack on sausages. Maybe in Germany people do both but in Singapore, I've heard of almost no one having a beer with their lunch, not even the Brits. If that offended anyone (either comparing the Brits to Germans or vice versa) I apologize, but the point is, you can sell $8 sausages to people who are half drunk, but you won't get away with it at lunchtime. If I wanted a snack and literally next door I can buy a bag of fried chicken for $4.80 and its spicy and delicious, I ain't buying a sausage for $8 no matter how good it is. It's the same with the set meals - if I can get a steak and couple of healthy sides on brown rice at Daily Cut for $12, why would I want a lonely sausage and lonely unsauced chips and a soda for $12? Again not to keep harping on Erich's but a quick glance at his stand and you see prices like $1.50, $4.0, $2.50 which hits his target market at Chinatown right. Bratworks could get away with $4-6 for a single sausage maybe but make it look bountiful and sizzling and irresistible.I think what makes Bratworks at ORP all the more sad is that I never see the owners around. It strikes me as one of those places set up by a banker who wanted to eat his homeland snack but couldn't get it anywhere, so he bought state of the art equipment and hired some kid to stand behind the counter. That's about as much passion I see. It is ironic because Bratworks is owned by the Chaoying group, which is behind Sabai by the Bay and Long Tail bar, so the owners do have F&B experience. Oh well...."

Don't get me wrong, I still love eating at The Daily Cut, but it is just that few times you can eat in a month since it's relatively expensive and the food quality can swing like a pendulum (good to bad, or vice versa).  I consider myself a regular at WB and thoroughly enjoyed my meal everytime I eat there. While the food is good, the name of the item has got to be the weirdest I've ever encountered like Lava Rice, Penguin, Whale and etc which has nothing related to your rice, noodles or salad. My all-time favorite is brown rice with teriyaki chicken ($8) or grilled salmon ($9). All rice comes with a side of salad and mushroom (sorry I don't know the exact name of it). Top up another $2 and you'll get an upsize salad which I usually order. If you're not into brown rice, opt for soba noodles instead. Served cold with a toss of Japanese dressing and slivers of carrot, it sure is very appetizing. I was pretty shock to read the review from other yelpers on the size portion, saying it's too small. And then I realized the reviews were 2 or 3 years old so it might not be accurate for now. Trust me, they have revamp the entire concept and the portion is substantial enough to fill you up.  Service is always very efficient - you order at the counter and will be given a buzzer.

Their salads so however taste very good, with lots of different dressings and toppings with an Asian touch, the cold soba goes perfectly - very clever idea by whoever came up with it I thought!Service is fast as most of their food is cold and prepared in advance.  I didn't however try their baumkuchen cakes - didn't really notice the cakes, thought this was more a salad place, so I'll have to go back and try it since that's what they seem to be famous for?"

But I was quite full after devouring it all.. Green soba noodles in sesame sauce (seemed rather mayo-ish, and actually there was a bit too much sauce, should've asked for it on the side or something), shredded chicken (admittedly, somewhat dry and stringy - definitely needed the sauce to counter the dryness), egg (nice thin strips!), cucumber, carrots, salad. The description says quail egg, but I didn't see any! Hmph.Anyway, wasn't super wowed by it, not bad, but not amazing either. Might try the reindeer noodles sometime or something!"

Price wise, I'd have to say its reasonable compared to what I paid in Japan.

You can also have the curry with rice.Besides the curry, everything else is in the rather eclectic mix of a menu is pedestrian. You have the usual rice and noodle dishes from hokkien mee to fried rice and then there's also the western dishes from oatmeal fish (not too bad!) to chicken chop.

I've had the fried chicken and milk tea. The fried chicken pales in comparison to the ones at Shihlin Street Snacks, despite the fact that Shihlin itself is already a poor cousin of the original Shihlin uncle in Taiwan. Xiao Wang Bar's chicken is coated in a batter and deep fried, but somehow it's never fried well enough for the batter to come out crispy.  So you have this soggy chicken that's then dusted with spice/chilli powder mix but very sparingly so that you get a mild, soggy bag of chicken. This has happened to me enough times when ordering the cutlet and pieces that I gave up eating here. The milk tea here is very sweet but I suppose that's how Taiwanese milk tea is supposed to taste? My general sense frequenting this outlet is that the employees don't feel for the brand and aren't enthusiastic about putting across the quirky Taiwanese street stall culture of quick, loud but happy service, which I have strangely enough experienced at the Far East Square and Harbourfront Shihlin Street Snacks outlets. I think the franchise owner needs to work on ensuring consistency in the product."

It's a small shop space but the inside is cooled by a great air-con and the outdoor area is covered by a gazebo. Most customers order their salads to go so you don't have to worry too much about seat competition. The salad set up is simple - take your box of leaves from the fridge, give it to the server and pick your toppings (6 Tossz-in's for $7.50). You have to pay more for meat proteins and servings tend to be on the small side (like 2 strips of bacon is one serving). I like the honey mustard dressing best, while the Caesar dressing tends to taste strangely light and sour. Also, they don't offer free tap water here. I would argue you get a better deal price wise at Fresh+ and even Salads & Wraps. Oh and don't eat the Granny's stew because it is quite awful, trust me on this one. Stick to the salads."

It was a lab of innovation with the birth of the Yam Ring ( an homage to  a monks alm bowl) , the origin of Lo Hei and so on. Laiwah is a good place to honour a chef that has come before us - food wise they churn out food incredibly quick so feel free to indulge.Venison Horfun was delish(MUst order!), some of the dishes are now rare fare in most Cantonese places so are definitely worth  a try. I found the mandarin stewed chicken a little heavy for me but I think thats cos I am trying it in 2015.. Pork chops in delish sauce are pretty yummy though so I guess fried pork does transcend time. The chicken with broccoli and ham was also rather unusual as I have not had that before. Pretty good with white rice though."

All on an onion bagel. It was easily was of the messiest bagels I've ever eaten, but also one of the best (comparable to the one I've had in New York). Just everything was perfect.

It was juicy, so much flavor, and as soon as it get set on the table my mouth was watering. It was my first time ever having Hainanese chicken in Singapore, but just from the smell and look of the chicken, I knew it was going to be amazing. Much more translucent than chicken back in California where I'm from, probably because of how fresh and preservative free it was. However, I would give the chicken from Chatterbox a slight edge. Rice: this is why I like Boon Tong Kee just slightly more. The rice has more of the chicken flavor, hearty, and a stronger smell. Love love love this rice, best rice I've ever had, period!Both restaurants are good, Boon Tong Kee is almost a hole in the wall set up, no one dressed up, older furniture, and chatterbox is very fancy.

Luckily we knew what we wanted and quickly placed our orders right after we were seated. The lime juice was perfectly tangy and refreshing on a hot summer night. We started off with the thick soup with dried scallop, crab meat, and sweet corn (slightly sweet and seafood flavors), the deep fried bean curd with Thai style sauce (super smooth tofu and evenly fried exterior), and fried long bean with beancurd cube, nuts and minced pork (loved the salty and nutty flavor). The signature boiled chicken was of course the main event and the most prized dish on our table. The boneless chicken was amazingly smooth and could have done without any sauce or dressing because that's how tasty it was by itself.

I got about 50/50 vote for Tian Tian and Boon Tong Kee. And I tried both - Boon Tong Kee won by miles.-) Hainan Chicken Rice: I was blown away by the taste of their chicken. It's super soft yet tender (hard to explain), super moist, and with strong ""chicken smell"" (meaning it doesn't have a ""frozen smell"" sometimes you may experience if the chicken isn't well prepared). You have to try it in person to understand how it felt. The rice, although it looks like regular steam rice, it has a strong chicken taste; not very moist but if you eat with the chicken it will be the best combination.-)  (馬拉盞) Belacan Vege: another great dish. The chef cooked it very well; fresh vege and nice smell similar to shrimp paste. Very good to go with rice.-) Coffee Ribs: I heard it is a famous cooking method although it was the first time I tried. Very unique; it does have a strong coffee smell. Personally I like coffee a lot so this dish was another wonderful one.-) Crab Meat Fish Stomach Soup: pretty amazing again; a lot of crab meat and fish stomach, the soup itself can make you full. Well cooked.Definitely Boon Tong Kee is the restaurant I look forward to the most when I go Singapore again. It is a chain store with 4-5 restaurants; did a bit of map research and this location is probably the easiest accessible one for tourists staying in downtown. Right next to subway station, and Singapore Subway map is pretty self-explanatory too.I can't wait to go again!"

The flavor of their chickens and chili sauces are very similar, but their rice differs quite greatly. Boon Tong Kee's rice tends to be milder in flavor, and therefore not as oily or salty. So in the end, it's all about your preference.This particular location is located right by the MRT station and of the typical size. We had to wait a few minutes for a table even though it was after the lunch rush on a weekday. Surprisingly, our hostess was very courteous and everyone we dealt with afterwards were also gracious. This is surprising to me as in all my years living and visiting Singapore, I can count the # of good service I've gotten with just my two hands.In addition to the Hainanese Chicken Rice, we also ordered the Fried Tofu, which was one of the best fried tofus I've ever had in my life.

You must mark off everything you want - nothing comes with your initial order. We ordered quite a bit of variety (see pictures) and it was so delicious!

There's no parking around, so I'd highly recommend taking public transportation or Uber. Upon entering you're  greeted with a heavy curry aroma with a shrimpy undertone that belongs to the Laksa steamboats. Kinda like alittle bit of b.o., It isn't the most appetizing of smells, but if you can get past this, you'll be richly rewarded. On the table we ordered your common hotpot ingredients: sliced beef, sliced chicken, tofu, multiple types of meatballs, and sine veggies to make us feel less guilty for the massive amounts of gluttony we were about to partake. One uncommon item I usually don't have with hotpot, or have ever really had, is the fried fish skin. Sounds gross but let me tell you that after tasting this delectable treat, I'd eat a garbage bag full of these things if given the chance. Think pork rinds but tastier and every bit as unhealthy. I didn't think the fried fish skin could be improved upon, until the locals had me dip the delectable fish chips into the Laksa broth. I know I said I'd eat a garbage bag full of the plain fish skins, but give me a supply of this Laksa broth, I'd eat these by the truck full. We had both the chicken broth with the Laksa broth (don't forget to add the Laksa herb! ), but after 3 minutes nobody ate from the chicken broth much more. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was absolutely clean and delicious, but the lala broth was like liquid crack. After the first bite, you'll be so addicted that you'll be chasing that Laksa broth high for the rest of your life. If you're a foodie and in Singapore, do yourself a favor and hit this joint up."

You have to drive round the vicinity to look for parking lots maybe there's some lot behind the building. But if you are lucky enough, you might be able to park illegally in front of the restaurant. Please note only 3 precious lots available. My Girlfriend and i was so excited to try out this laksa steamboat. We order the laska and chicken soup base to start off. After browsing the menu we ordered the usual food like mushroom, prawn, fish, beef etc. The serving is good and fresh.Guess what! After placing our food in the laksa broth, we girls decided to abandon the chicken broth as the laksa broth is simply too yummy. Our saliva is drooling and we simply can't resist it.This restaurant is on ala carte menu which means that you have to pay as you order. We order so much food and got our tummy stuff full.

For those who drive, don't expect to park outside of this restaurant as there are only about three parking lots, so you'll have to seek alternative parking spaces (my friends parked at a street and a church near the restaurant).  So anyway, on to the food. We tried the laksa and chicken soup base, and both were excellent. Obviously, the laksa broth was the popular choice, but I liked having the chicken soup in between every laksa portion to clear my palette. Instead of the usual steamboat buffets, this restaurant uses an ala carte system, which means that you pay as you order. Everything that came was fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, the beef was out of stock that evening and a friend didn't take pork, so we didn't get to try their meats. My friends and I over ordered and stuffed ourselves silly, but ended up only having to pay $20 per pax, which is rather cheap considering that we also ordered the more expensive drinks (about $3.50 each). Great stuff! I hope this place stays this way for a long while."

Nothing comes close outside of Singapore. except maybe Panya in Honolulu. Don't settle for M'sian style laksa and it's Definitely not the same as Assam Laksa from M'sia. eeeeeks- Tons of items you can order to dump into this pot of amazingness; i highly recommend fishcakes, otak and the noodles.

Yes, the Hawker was once empty a few months ago, but since the close of the Lavender Hawker, this place is now buzzing with fully occupied stalls.My personal favorite stalls are Ah Hui Big Prawn Noodle, Soy Chicken Noodle / char siew noodle, and John Thai. The John Thai stall in particular is truly special at the corner of the hawker (warning: a little difficult to find). Managed by a Thai family judging from the language they were speaking at the time of my order, this Thai stall is able to whip out some dishes that is very reminiscent of those found on the streets of Bangkok. I ordered the Grilled Squid and the seafood fried rice. The squid was cooked to perfection. Smokey yet chewy on the outside with a chilly like dip that is simply out of this world. I would describe it as a lemon zesty chilly spice. The other two stalls are nothing special, but good nonetheless and always nice to have in any hawker.Balestier Hawker is very clean relative to some hawkers out there and is much closer to the folks living in Novena as opposed to the Whampoa hawker. Although, the Whampoa hawker has much more famous food stalls, this is a great hawker for those who value a shorter work and a relatively cleaner dining experience."

The chicken basil was a bit salty and both items had a fishy smell to them which immediately turned me off,I also opted to try their avocado smoothie from the center drink stall.1) tasted nothing like avocado-- it was extremely watered down and 2) was more brown than a fresh green, so thanks for essentially the old avocado water!I won't judge the entire place based on two stalls, so will give this the benefit of the doubt, but likely won't be returning to those two!"

There are a decent variety of stalls to choose from, but still a lot of empty spots.

Let me emphasize that again, as a TOURIST, I found the place quite amazing. It was near the train station and I happened upon it after getting off the subway. Gelling Bahru Market and Food Centre to my understanding is one of the many hawker centers located throughout Singapore. A hawker center is basically a food court full of street food vendors. Unlike a food court that you would find at an American mall however, a hawker center has unique food as each booth is its own thing. At an American mall you would normally find chains occupying the spaces. Within the hawker center, you will find many different types of foods local to Singapore from rice dishes to soups to drinks to toast. As for which place is the one, a Singaporean put it best stating that it is a matter of personal preference. With my preference, I lean towards the rice dishes although I have heard good things about the soups and toast. Everything is cash so you will need to locate an ATM around the area since there isn't one right there where the food stalls are. I believe I went around to one of the stores until I could locate one. The food itself is super cheap so you will not be breaking the bank. For example, chicken rice was about $3 Singapore which is $2.19 USD. When you finish your food you can just leave the plate/bowl on the table and someone will take care of it. Just something to note since I myself was scared to leave trash around from rumors I heard about the country."

I will be honest, I am not a fan of most Food courts or hawker Centers. Please do not burn me at the stake, my Texas pallet just needs a little time to adjust. I will put it this way, no adjustment needed for PasarBella. It is an inviting, hip food court. The feel is very sleek and everything is spot on. The decor is fabulous and inviting and the music is awesome. I was overwhelmed by the choices. I ordered a sushi roll from Rolly Ollies. It is by far the most delicious (and filling) sushi roll that I have had in Singapore. My Husband had a Wolf burger, sweet potato fries and a vanilla milkshake. He kindly shared a couple of sips of his milkshake with me. It was outstanding. PasarBella is the perfect jumping off point for a food court trip. I will be back!"

The dish came with a wonderful side dish of mashed potatoes that worked pretty flawlessly with the meat. I also ordered a vienna sausage which was really the dish that stole the show. A small simple sausage dish that you must try to have a clue why i would give this place a 5 star rating.

In addition, they have a decent choice of cooked sides, soups and other banchan.The only downside I can think of is that the grill is on the smallish side for the table but that helps you stop overeating so actually it is almost a plus. Also, in contrast with most kbbq's the staff is quite prompt in clearing the table so you always have sufficient space.The fact that it was completely packed on Saturday evening and had a line in front (which we could easily cut since we called up front for reservations) shows that I am not the only one who likes this place!

I finally decided to give it a try. It's main target audience are youngsters or students who want some korean bbq at a reasonable price. The prices range from $19.90++ to $24.90++ for weekend lunches. Check out therir facebook page as they randomly have facebook promotions just like the one they had on the day I visited, at just $19.90++ per pax for a group of 6 and more!They have a rather huge dining area, that can fit pretty much any party size. The minute you walk in, you will realize the drinks are on the right, cooked food is displayed against the wall at the back of the restaurant and all the tables are in a horizontal layout, parallel to the main street. You will also notice that it doesn't have a strong bbq smell, that most girls are afraid of smelling like, after the meal! Do not fret as they have vents to suck up the BBQ smells, there's even ocsilating fans to keep the air fresh.At the cooked food station, there's some sushi, soup, korean pancakes, noodles and steamed rice. I highly recommend trying their fried chicken wings.They are HUGE! Not to mention, these chicken wings put 4 Fingers to shame! The skin is so crispy, the meat is tender and the sauce has a tangy sweetness to it.Pick your vegetables and seafood too! The prawns were fresh looking and rather sizeable. The variety of vegetables should be sufficient for most. They were replenished frequently too! Lots of vegetables to go along with the meat. Lettuce is fresh and crazily crunchy and it is a MUST HAVE for me at Korean BBQs because I always use them to wrap up my meat.Moving onto the actual bbq, the bbq surface area was decent enough for 4, you could separate your meats, ie (beef, non-beef or spicy and non-spicy) The hot plate itself got hot pretty quickly and you can control the temperature on the side of the hot plate.I would usually cook the beef atop the vegetables, such as onion or mushroom, so that the vegetables would absorb all the juices from the meat and at the same time, the meat would be good in a reasonable amount of time.After cooking, the meats were tender and juicy. Definitely better than I had expected. Grab a plate or two and stack them up with meats and also get ready to stack up another plate of cooked food! Also, to my pleasant surprise, the staff were extremely friendly and taught us how to cook and eat the meats with the vegetables. I had no problems getting the staff attention whenever I needed help or assistance.They had a varienty of meats, such as marinated ribeye, beef roll, pork belly, chicken and for those who love spicy. Go for their volcano style seasoned meats, you will not be disappointed.Check out the colours of the beef and also the mountain of raw meats, eying for an empty spot on the BBQ hot plate! The Beef Rolls cook fast and I cut them up into even pieces. These fine slices of beef are delectable and easy to eat. They are savoury but not overwhelming, and make for the perfect start to my Korean BBQ feast.The bacon strips were my favourite. Probably the most unhealthy, but it was salty and juicy, overflowing with fatty goodness. The meat also so very soft and fresh. Bacon lovers will probably love the unlimited amounts of bacon available here.There's also free flow of non-alcholic drinks such as iced water, lime juice, mango juice, rice punch and korean barley tea. All the drinks tasted rather diluted to me but the sweetest drink for me which I liked was the rice punch. They also sell alcoholic drinks for those who want a complete Korean bbq meal!Conclusion : I'm Kim delivered great value meats and cooked food buffet with excellent staff service and atmosphere.Head here for a fuss free korean BBQ that is gentle on your wallet!"

The spiciest volcano chicken was something to be reckon with! unless chilli padi is your best friend or that you enjoy the sensation of having a numb tongue and sausage lips, don't bother trying it out. the sides of Korean fried chicken, candied sweet potato, tteokbokki. japchae, chicken soup, seafood (namely shrimp/prawn), lettuce, drinks etc weren't too shabby as well.

I've tried a few kbbq buffet places in random malls, and they are usually okay because when everything fails, one can eat chadol (thinly sliced beef brisket) with ssamjang and lettuce and be completely satisfied paying $24 since meat is so expensive in Singapore. Not this place. I'm Kim somehow managed to make ssamjang that's just wrong.There is a range of ssamjang flavors that can all be acceptable but the ssamjang here is not within that range. This affects everything you eat in kbbq because it's the basic sauce. In most kbbq places in Singapore, the meat is not of great quality (unlike Los Angeles where they somehow get good meat and low prices). Usually the chadol is edible because there is no marinate to screw up, and it wasn't a great cut to begin with. Kalbi on the other hand is always bad because they use the wrong ribs (kalbi is not just any rib) plus the marinate could be wrong. Everything else depends on the marinate, so I usually try it but don't count on it. Here, none of the meats work. The kalbi is surprisingly the least offensive.The vegetable options are bad. The kimchi and any seasoned namul have a strange seasoning. I do highly recommend the pickled daikon for pairing with meats that are overly marinated to tone it down. I would prefer a more tender green leaf lettuce than the romaine leaves they offered.There seemed to be a lot of side dishes but I felt like there wasn't much to eat. The japchae was the best side dish. It was strange to see samosas. Honeyed sweet potatoes are dessert not appetizer. I skipped the fries and mandu.I managed to feed myself but I won't be coming back. Service was fine. The guy came by to change the grill once."

There are a good variety of meats to choose from, pork loin belly, marinated beef, marinated short ribs... not bad, I liked the pork loin belly myself, but that's what I normally eat when I'm having bqq. The selection seems to be centered around the meats which isn't a bad thing. There is plenty of kimchee, lettuce wrap, picked dikon wrap, and garlic and peppers to litter your ssam.Definitely better than what I would expect at an all you can eat bbq joint and better than the BBQ buffets back home for sure. This place is more value and bang for the buck. Amongst bbq buffets I'd say 4 stars, but relative to other kbbq places 3 stars for quality of meats.

While they have a kitchen serving brunch and tapas (try the Truffle Chips!), the biggest drawing factor for me is definitely the all-day bar which serves American craft beers. In case your hipster friend hasn't already let you in on the latest booze to hit town, craft beer has been popping up in cool cafes like Assembly Ground and Morsels (you know, the kind that has wooden clipboard menus). But as far as I know, Hop Heads is the first bar that is dedicated to craft beers only (their headliner is ""Craft Beer Bar and Bistro""). Craft beer is like the whiskey of booze. It's a lot more complex than your regular heineken or tiger beers, so it's like a whole new experience with every gulp. If you have a good palette, you'd probably be able to describe the craft beer like connoisseurs talk about wine (""a hint of clove"" ""an apple aftertaste"") but if you're just a regular jane like me it's just pretty cool that you can actually smell the flavours before (and after!) you taste it. So naturally you'd think that such speciality beers would be pricier than usual, but here comes the kicker - the entire bar is priced lower than anything you'd find along clarke quay. With beers and ciders ranging from $8-$15, most of the patrons guzzle about 2-3 bottles or pints each. Yes! They have 2 beers on tap. Go To IPA seems to be the more popular one but my favourite is the Summer Solstice. It's seasonal though so I'm waiting to see what's going to replace it.Besides the summer solstice on tap i would recommend the hazelnut brown nectar - it's really amazing!!!! And my lager-loving friends love the oatmeal lager (it sounds funky but apparently its so good they cant get enough). So if you're in town around dhoby ghaut (or happen to be staying at Innotel Hotel) , this is an awesome place for a mid-day beer or  after-dinner drinks. See u there!"

It is quite accessible from my home either by bus or car (duh!). Parking can be quite a pain in the ass especially on weekends, and sometimes even on weekdays too (dinner time). Anyway, moving on! Personally, to be honest, IMHO, the best prawn hokkian mee is located here! You could easily tell by the ridiculous queue most of the time! However, it is pretty efficient because the staff would ask about your order and get it done while you're still in line, the next thing you know, BAM, your hokkian mee is done! I'd suggest to always order the $5 one in medium portion even when you're alone. The smallest size ($4) plate simply isn't worth it. The next best thing I found here, that is less mainstream is large steamed fish head in black bean sauce ($15) with rice. They put a lot of ginger in it (which is my fave)! The fish is always fresh with soft texture, accompanied with tons of bones! Must slowly eat! I also tried fried yong tau foo! I tried about 5 different kinds: (Not sure about the names but I'll try to describe it)1. Fried yam in orangish color (meh!)2. Flat keropok in yellow color with some prawns (meh!)3.

Maybe I was expecting smooth silky thin kway teow like Hock Lam, so this version was the thick sticky kway teow which stuck together. The uncle was very nice though. I love the coffee at Seletar Coffee (facing the car park), near the Chinese dessert stall. It was thick and milky. And it was cheap when compared to other places. I heard it used to be 50 cents but the price has since increased. Still, for 2 small cups of coffee and an iced coffee, it was under $2.50. Where else can you get such prices?

This place is legit Singaporean realness because every time we go the locals are always here in full force, which makes seating a bit of a challenge. Thanks to Nik T.'s suggestion, my husband is ALL OVER the $8 oyster omelette at Ah Hock Fried Oyster, stall #54. I'm a fan of the seafood fried rice, but at this moment I'm not sure what the stall number is... will have to get back to you on that. It's served with pickled jalapeno on the side, and if I weren't already married, it would've been my next choice for a future life partner. I'm also a fan of the hokkien mee. Again, I forgot the stall number, but it's one of those stalls that always has a line so it's not hard to miss. And the chicken wings in stall #76! Those are always a good time.Add my favorite sugar cane juice with the above dishes, and all is well with the world. Guess I need to head back again so I can verify the stall numbers and lead you all in the right direction. ;)"

Although again, not the easiest to get to with the MRT. We had to take a bus transfer, but thanks to the kindness of strangers, we managed to find it perfectly due to their instruction. Plenty of open (and closed stalls), and a lot of them sell the same or similar items, so you just have to choose which one to go to. I tended towards the stalls with longer lines in hopes that also meant delicious food. I got a yummy and cheap wonton noodle soup and a beer, while my friend ordered a Singapore chicken rice and a lo po gao. All so very delicious. The dessert stalls were a bit lacking, but we managed to find one where I ordered a black rice pudding. Delicious and not overly sweet. Thank you, taxi driver! P.S.

It only costs 3 dollars, is clean and quick to deliver. This is a typical hawker centre, you will find many tables all squashed into a space that so many tables shouldn't be able to physically fit in, but I guess the set up works for everyone. The cleanliness is not the best you will find, though there are many cleaners constantly working at maintaining the cleanliness of the hawker centre, the place never seems to be kept clean! Rubbish sprayed all over the place, tissues and wrappers you will find on tables and the floor. This is a practical place to have a quick and cheap meal, no room for comfort here."

At the breakfast block there are two linked stalls that sell noodles in the morning, close in the afternoon to prepare for their dinner business, and open in the evening to sell a very popular fish head steamboat. The original Loy Kee Chicken Rice is also at this block, and is near the corner where you can get really good Tau Huay that is made using traditional methods.The lunch/dinner blocks has even more hits.

They loved it so much they even ate their deep fried curry leaves that was in it! Hubby said this was like extreme Muruku. Onion strips with Muruku coating! Must eat there, fresh and crispy!Butter Chicken - buttery and creamy and just delightful. My girl was practically drinking the sauce! Mutton Tikka - they didn't have it on their menu but this is a FAVOURITE dish of my hubby's and their chef very generously said yes. So they made that dish specially for him. It was also another hit with my children. Even I was impressed. I have tried many others and theirs was really one of the better ones. Rogan Josh - lamb chunks cooked in spicy curry. I swear mutton is not the easiest meat to handle and they do it right! And the curry sauces are seriously distinct from each other but still oh-so-yummy!!!Aloo Gobi - I was slightly disappointed when I saw their it was quite dry with no sauce. But the taste just knocked my socks off. Seriously one of the best Aloo Gobi I have eaten. I could finish bowls of this!Chicken Biryani - this was served in this deceptively small bowl with lovely spiced rice and tenderly cooked chicken chunks. My girls LOVED the chicken in this dish. And after many spoons of rice was eaten, the bowl still looked kinda half full!! Hub and I was so full after we finished the rice but no regrets there. Butter and Garlic Naans - this was another great dish. We ordered 2 first and then had to top up with another naan. Evident that my girls were just packing the naans away!!!We are seriously fans of this very understated eatery now. The service is swift and very sincere."

We've been here when it rains, and the staff is pretty good at moving the tables and chairs a bit further in to ensure nothing gets wet. Also, if it's busy, they always manage to pull a table out of nowhere and set it up for you. So far, we've never made reservations and we've been lucky to get a table each time.

I greatly enjoyed the murgh malai tikka, fish tikka and their assortment of naans. The tikka dishes were note-worthy, and the accompanying mint sauce was as authentic as you can get. I was instantly transported to my favourite spot in Delhi! It certainly is pricey in comparison to other eating places in Balestier. We paid slightly over S$40 for two. It was, however, a real treat and a nice change from the usual fare in Balestier. My only real gripe about this place is the set-up.

Service was quick and we after we spoke to the owner, we let him order for us.To cut a long story short, the food was great, much better value than many of the overpriced Indian restaurants closer to the tourist areas of the city. The lamb chops in particular were so good we had to order some more. Service was brisk but friendly. Only advice would be to watch out for the Kingfisher with 8.8% alc by volume.

Probably it was over-shadowed by Old Hen next door? ;)Beautiful dried flowers surround the cafe and it looked as if you've indeed stepped into an enchanted forest. Not to worry, there's not too much green that it might be scary for those with sensitive noses, like me. The wooden chairs/tables (though not all consistent in type) complemented the plants/dried flowers very well. My favourite, was the wall of oddities right next to the main door - you wouldn't even know that they were selling wrapped novels from The Novel Encounter (see pictures).Anyway, we were partly enticed by the promotion that the cafe is having now, that's why we headed there - Order a burger and get a specialty coffee for $1(Promotion valid til 13 April!)Verdict:* Ngoh Hiang Burger (with extra side of scrambled eggs as recommended by the lady boss) - The patty was juicy but I felt it was a tad small (I love patties, so the bigger the better!). The cold potato salad was heavenly; not sure what spices or herbs they used but I love the herb-y taste. The buns themselves were not too big but were nicely crisp on the outside. Overall, quite a creative dish.* Truffle fries - This didn't make it to my Top 5 list but the truffle smell did last longer and tasted better then average. A good snack to order should you decide to sit for a while longer and chat.* Mocha - If you're a Mocha fan, you've got to try this. The balance of coffee, milk and chocolate is perfect! After sipping many a Mocha in Norway and Iceland, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the first cup of Mocha I tasted in Singapore seems to be on par with what I had there.* Latte - Another perfect cup.Also, the theme of flowers/trees/magic lives on in the washroom. Look in the mirror and you might find a very thought-provoking quote - kinda reminds me of Snow White.p.s I like my coffee not so milky or bitter so if you have similar taste as me, you might like my recommendations."

The Unicorn Hotcakes were so delicious with the perfect consistency. I'm from New York City and wish there was a place that could compare to this spot but unfortunately there is not. The Unicorn Hotcakes look like they could give you a toothache but! They are not as sweet as they look. Perfect amount of sweetness. Each different colored hotcake is a different flavor. My favorite flavor was the purple beetroot. WOW. Such a uniquely satisfying flavor that I had never tasted in a hotcake. I also had the Truffle Omelette which had a black truffle spread and tasted like perfection. The truffle taste wasn't overpowering at all. If you love truffle then try this dish. Mix the salad in with each bite. Perfect combination of flavors. The dressing for the salad is honey mustard and really complements the Truffle Omelette.One of the other things I tried was the fries with truffle mayo. Also a win. Perfect crisp to each fry with a great flavored truffle mayo to dip in to. Lemon Yuzu Tart was yet another winner because unlike most lemon tarts, it was not overpowered by the lemon. This place knows how to feed their customers right! I will definitely be back again during my business trip in Singapore and will surely be dreaming of the magical Unicorn Hotcakes once I return home to New York City."

This is the description of the dish on the menu: An all-time classic French delicacy of shredded duck leg confit and roasted leeks tossed with fusilli cooked al dente. Sounds amazing, isn't it? That's what I thought too. However it turns out that this dish is very very ordinary - taste wise & appearance wise.

So stick to that. People seem to be hit or miss for the chili crab but we didn't get a chance to try it. There's an option on the menu for the chili crab sauce + mantous but they were sold out by the time we got here. Also - I expected an actual restaurant, but this was more of a bunch of hawker stands stringed together. Which means you're exposed to the elements of Singapore. So if you expect a nice meal with air con, you're out of luck here. As far as the food goes - I enjoyed it. However, I'd say this tasted like a classic Chinese preparation of seafood (think of the scallion and ginger flavors) but with a kick of white pepper. It was good, but I'm not sure it was worth the price (roughly $90 a kg when we went). Additionally, there's additional charges for EVERYTHING. So decline them when they try to bring you an appetizer or even the wet naps. Just bring your own water & tissues. There's a bathroom available for you to wash your hands."

Chili crab - must get, obviously.  The meat was tender and fresh.  The sauce was spicy for everyone, but not really spicy at all for me.  Everyone was sweating, but I was fine, so it depends on your spice tolerance.2. Salt/chili fried bullfrog - this was actually my favorite dish out of the bunch.  Perfectly battered and crispy outside that was salty and a little bit spicy.  SO GOOD3.

I know about the other alternatives and do plan to test them out but for now it was No Signboard.I found this seafood restaurant very accessible via public transport (get off on the Aljunied stop on the Green East West MRT line and its a short walk from there). Me and some work mates thought we would get our Chilli Crab on and swanned down here after work the other day.Rocking up around 7pm, there was still a few spare tables so we didn't have to wait - bonus! Chilli crab was always going to be on our menu so that was a given. We also had the Drunken Bull Frog and Sambai Kang Kong.With 4 beers on offer (Guiness, Tiger, Heineken and Carlsberg) we opted for the Tiger which goes for $8 for the bigger bottles. The crab is priced at $60 a kilo and then you just decide which way you want it cooked and go from there. We generally went for around half a kilo of crab each because we were trying other options from the menu.The Chilli Crab? AMAZING! Then again it is my only benchmark, but for now I am thoroughly impressed. The Drunken Bull Frog was a close second for me but maybe that is because I miss frog (we don't really have that in Australia).Its all very out in the open and as other people have said, I would probably avoid this place on a really hot and steamy day. But as it was the other night (a bit cooler) I found it quite pleasant. Bring napkins or wet wipes too as they don't provide them free of charge. Chilli crab can get quite messy so bear this in mind when deciding what to wear there as well! All in all I walked away thoroughly impressed and plan to return in future to sample the White Pepper Crab which I hear is something of a specialty here also."

The waiters will put appetizers and wet wipes on the table without telling you it's not free. Thankfully we didn't eat anything so waiters took it away. They also try to upsell you on other entrees. Don't get suckered and just stick to the crab. Also their tea sucks. Costs $2 for Chinese tea and it was basically their version of a Lipton tea bag- bitter.

I am not a fan of chilli crabs I prefer black pepper crab; 2. I tried No Signboard in Hong Kong a few years ago and it was grossly overpriced with small portions; 3.  prior experiences with other famous and tourists oriented joints like Long Beach and Jumbo left the same impression that these famous crab places are rip-offs.  I am so wrong!  The chilli crab is amazing! and I don't even like chilli crab in the first place.  We ended up ordering extra servings of the little fried buns so we can scoop up the very last drop of sauce.  The other chilli crabs I have tasted so far all just tasted like spicy ketchup to me but the No Signboard version is different - just the right blend of spicyness and sweetness.  Oh and we ordered the white pepper crab since I have only had the black pepper version before and it is also yummy!  And oh the size of the crab, which is important, we ordered the smallest sized crab and the meat is very fresh and dense.We also had the stir fried sotong with pepper and chilli, a baby kailan, half an butter chicken and a bitter gourd soup.  The price is not cheap but hey, compared with all the other crab places around town I found it very reasonable.  It comes down to about SGD50 each for the 4 of us and we are stuffed to the brim.  Last time we spent about the same at Jumbo and had to order McDonalds later in the night.  So farewell Jumbo and Long Beach.  The outdoor seatings are spacious and comfortable and I think it's a great place to take visitors to since you can take a stroll around Geylang before or after dinner. This is probably the one non-sterile place in Singapore and shows that this place offers more than just glass and steel buildings or HDB blocks.  We also had durian a bit further down Geylang road - a very sweet ending to our night out in Geylang."

My husband can't handle too much spice, and it was just the two of us, so we chose the next most talked about dish- white pepper crab! We also ordered drunken shrimp and fried rice. The drunken shrimp was served to us in big bowls filled to the brim with soup, and I enjoyed it very much. The fried rice, however, was probably the best fried rice I've ever tasted in my life. There was a little bit of everything in there, and it was absolutely divine. We also loved how they served it as our first dish, as we prefer to eat the rice with our crab. As for our white pepper crab, it didn't disappoint! It was served with a really flavorful sauce and some veggies that complimented the crab perfectly. It wasn't spicy, but at the same time it had taste, which made both me and my husband happy campers!No bibs were given to us (were we supposed to ask for them?), but they did have small IKEA laundry baskets at each table where you can keep your purse and any outerwear that you don't want to stain. Make sure to bring tissues if one wet nap isn't enough for you! Also, they do have a VIP section, which I presume means air conditioning. Not sure if there's anything special you need to do to get in, or if the prices are different!Speaking of prices, I did find it a bit pricey, as the bill for the two of us was $115 (however, this did include 1 large Tiger beer that we split and a dessert as well.) They do accept credit cards, though.Bottom line, I am a newly converted fan, and one of these days I will return and try the chili crab once and for all! Maybe I'll also bring a bottle of wine with me, as the corkage fee is only $10. Wanna come with? :)"

We tried the kang kong, the oyster sauce kai lan, the chicken wings in prawn paste, the steamed bums, and the white pepper and chilli crab. Jury is still out on which one is better... Be warned, the chilli crab is pretty spicy for most ang mo palates, however it didn't stop our British guest getting amongst. Total bill $148 for four people including 3 large tiger beers. We left very full.. I will be back with more of our international visitors. Be prepared to get messy."

Can't remember if they have Salted Egg Yolk, which has become one of my favorite flavors for crabs.The Black Pepper crab looks harmless enough but boy is it spicy! Really peppery flavor that turned on the faucet in my nose and had it running for a while. The restaurant gave us the male crab for this dish. I love the kick of the pepper in this dish. You gotta eat this fast because it turns cold due to the lack of a gravy to keep it heated. Apparently the white pepper crab was the original signature dish of NS but now people associate them with Chili crabs. Shall try that another time.NS used to hold the standard for Chili crabs in Singapore (according to this skinnyfat girl that is). Every other chili crab is either too tomato-ish, too diluted, too spicy or too ________(insert something negative here) as compared to NS. I'm sad to say that the standard has indeed fallen. I thought the gravy is watered down a little. It kinda lacks that oomph and punch that it used to possess. While the meat of the crab is succulent as before, the crabs are really pretty puny these days. The image of those HUGE Sri Lankan crab pincers from eons ago is still etched in my memory and the size of the current ones are really disappointing."

We reserved a table for 5 adults and 7 children for New Year's Day dinner. We were there around 7:30pm and the restaurant is already quite packed. I'd suggest you make reservations if your large party. Most of the tables are movable so it's easy to cater to groups of different sizes. The food taste pretty good. All the kids love it. However the Claypot Yee Mee tasted rather bland. Other dishes like the Loh Han Zai, Xiang Chun Fish, Cereal Abalone Mushroom (kids favorite), Basil eggplant, and Fried Spinach were tasty. The dishes arrive quite quickly after ordering. The servers however are not very attentive or at least the one that served us was not attentive. When the Claypot Yee Mee arrived we had to ask her to bring us some bowls after we noticed she has no intention of doing so. Atmosphere is not too bad. Generally quiet except for our table of children. I did observed 2 Indian families dining there so I guess the food is agreeable to vegetarians of different cultural background or is it that I need to get outside more. Price wise I find it affordable. 8 dishes, 7 steam rice and a pot of tea cost less than $120. Give it a try if you are thinking of vegetarian."

But there is no need to gossip about me saying that I am asking for more money items.

The char siew is not bad too, though I prefer it a bit sweeter. I am docking a star because of their noodles, as the noodles were over cooked and too soft, with really underwhelming wantons.

The meat and the dumpling itself was delicious, but I wouldn't say it was mind blowing. Maybe I had high expectations because it was so hyped up. I also tried the steamed chicken soup, because the menu said it was another thing they were famous for. I didn't like this as much. I thought the broth was kind of bland and most of the chicken was white meat, so slightly dry.They give you a pen and you have to mark down how many of each item you want.

The waiting time can range from 10-30 minutes on the weekends although they are kind enough to let you pick your food while you wait and make your order just as you are whisked to a table. The menu is a bit limited in my opinion. No char siew pau or chee cheong fun, two staples on the dim sum menu. It's also not particularly adventurous if you are into that sort of thing. Having said that, whatever they do serve is very good promptly dished. The pork and chilli crab steamed bun is delicious, as is their soup dumplings. I'm also a sucker for their mango pudding which I never have space for because I've just gorged on 6 prawn and pork dumplings. If you want some otherworldly dim sum, you won't get it here.

There wasn't anything  particularly wrong with it but it lacked layers of flavours that would have brought it up a notch.tinyurl.com/md9rrdpChicken with wine sauce - This was such a enjoyable chicken dish.  it is another example of a dish that allowed the basic ingredient to shine through.  The wine sauce complimented the chicken without overwhelming it.  Plus, the chicken was very tender.tinyurl.com/lyzsb9gPrawn Fried Rice - I love rice.  But I tend to prefer steamed rices.  However, if I keep running into fried rices as good as this, I may become a convert.  It was light.  The prawns were sweet.  The eggs provided a rich earthy note.  At some level, it was difficult to believe this was a fried dish.tinyurl.com/kcpztlbCold Pork - I enjoyed the flavours of this dish.  The lightness of the pork.  The freshness of the onions.  The nice touch of the sesame seeds.  All that being said, I would prefer this dish with the pork served hot.tinyurl.com/mc6hn5jPrawn Dumplings - I love prawn dumplings.  These were very good.  Fresh, hot, sweet, etc..tinyurl.com/lpqr9n5Xia Long Bao (soup dumplings) - This is the dish that brings a lot of folks to Din Tai Fung.   They did not disappoint.  Dipped into the vinegar and ginger and then popped into your mouth for a flavour explosion.  Just make sure not to burn yourself.tinyurl.com/m7efulrI do not know the cost.  My friends were kind enough to treat me to dinner.Overall - Din Tai Fung is about the food and they delivered.  For the overall experience, I would say this was more 3.5 star than 4.  The food definitely warranted 4 stars.  The service could be a little more personable and little less rushed.   But, I guess if they didn't hurry, we would all have to wait a little longer to get our delicious Xia Long Bao."

There was typically a wait if you came at normal eating hours, and even off peak there were always plenty of tables filled up! I do like the numbering system and how they call out the tables, easier to hear than names being called and lets you not stand in a line like other places in the mall. Service was typically quick, although items came out as they were ready and not necessarily in the order that you would expect them. This didn't bother me as i was eating alone, but might be weird if you are in a group and ordering separately. Although this is a chain, i felt that this location was a nice option for dinner for almost any occasion from date night to casual eating alone.

I'm glad I read reviews of Din Tai Fung because I made the effort to find it and ended up going three times during a two week trip! My hotel (the Swissotel) was connected to the Raffles City mall, so that made it very convenient, but I still would have made the effort to go back. There was usually a line but it cleared quickly and the hostesses provided order sheets and menus so you could decide on your meal before you sat down. One of my favorite parts of the experience was the ""crib"" they provide for ladies' bags and that once you put your bag inside they cover it with a napkin as if the bags are being tucked in for a nap. But my most favorite thing were the dumplings. These soup dumplings might be the most delightful thing I have ever eaten. The sensation of putting one in your mouth and the warm soup bursting out (yeah, yeah, *phrasing boom*) just brings a smile to your face. The texture of the dumplings is firm, but soft, and the soup has great flavor. I tried several varieties, with the traditional pork being my favorite. The shrimp and the chicken were also good, but I didn't care for the crab very much. I also tried the shrimp fried rice and an eggplant side dish and both were great. I've seriously been telling everyone about these dumplings since I went on this trip. If you're in Singapore, Din Tai Fung is a must."

Naturally, once I found out that there was a location minutes away from my hotel in Singapore, I just had to check it out for comparison purposes. Prices are definitely higher, which is no shocking surprise. In the US, it's around $7-8 for a 10 pc of the juicy pork dumplings. In Singapore, it's closer to $11-12. The group of us weren't that hungry, so we only ordered 20 total for 4 people. Not only do they tack on $1 per person for tea (without even asking), but they also automatically added a service charge. So it ended up being close to $30 US dollars.Not a good value, by any means, and the XLB's where just about the same compared to the Arcadia location. If there was a slight difference, the skin was slightly thicker and chewier in Singapore -- which I didn't mind at all. Worth a try, but not again if I'm ever in Singapore again."

HAD to. We were in the area because there was a little anime festival going on at Funan mall, and this was the closest thing that served xiao long bao. We were seated promptly, and politely. It was rather cramped- you can tell they're trying to maximize space, and when there's only 2 people in your party... well. But really, we're not big, so we didn't mind rubbing elbows a little. Wound up chatting a bit to a couple of Frenchmen that were dining next to us, actually! (Frenchmen! You never get Frenchmen in Phoenix. I sometimes forget how urbane Singapore is.) The food we ordered was pretty standard. I waffled about getting the truffle xiao long bao but decided against it, going instead for the regular order of that, plus the signature jiao zi. My girlfriend got the dan dan mien, I got the zha jiang mien. We also shared the pickled shredded vegetables. Everything was pretty good- the skin on the bao thin, the broth hot. My zha jiang mien was delicious, and definitely better than what I could replicate at home. Mostly it was just a good fix of chinese food, and the coveted xiao long bao. I don't get a chance to have food like this back in Phoenix. 3.5 stars out of 5 for sure. Didn't round up as #1- it's a chain restaurant and #2, really nothing out of this world. Good solid fare, in a nice, air conditioned environment. WIN for me."

Food appears promptly, and they're a polished operation. (Which can't be said of every Din Tai Fung I've tried in Singapore)This is the Joshua list of what you MUST try at Din Tai Fung. Okay. Maybe not 'must' try. It's MY list after all. But trust me, these are some of the best things on the menu.Xiao Long Bao. The normal kind with pork.Xiao Long Bao WITH BLACK TRUFFLE. Now I know they're expensive at about $4 a pop, but HOT DIGGIDY DAMN they ARE GOOD. They're worth that $4, trust you me. The dumplings in chili oil and vinegar. These are so tasty it's ridonkulous. Eat them dumplings up, and keep a little of the oil and vinegar mix so you can dump it in the...Double boiled chicken soup with noodles.This is the one where the noodles and the soup come separate. The noodles are dry, in a bowl with spring onion and salt, and you're supposed to pour in some soup. BUT WAIT. We have that awesome vinegar chili oil mix still left over. POUR THAT IN. Spoon in 2-3 spoons of soup. And SAVOUR.Also definitely worth trying is the Shanghai drunken chicken. PACKED with flavour, this is my favourite cold starter item on the menu.Also generally well liked is the prawn pancake, which is crisp, seafoody goodness.OMG I need some XLB right now."

The chicken soup is also really tasty, as is the beef soup. We also really like the fried rice which is one of the best we've had.

Their Taiwan Shrimp and Pork Oriental Wantons with Spicy Sauce bring a fiery twist to the normal pork dumplings.

Another simple yet fulfilling dish to try is their Fried Rice with Pork Chop. The fried rice is cooked till fragrant, while the pork chop is tender and savory.

It's a sweet dumpling, filled with a soft and finely milled yam paste that isn't too cloyingly sweet. Aside from their dumplings, they also serve a great Bean Paste Noodles, that is mixed with  minced pork and tofu to give it a more Oriental feel compared to its Korean influences. Their Pork Chop Fried Rice, which sounds unassuming, is also deliciously crispy but thick served with steaming fragrant rice fried with battered eggs.

So indeed, they have been true to their words... For every ala carte serving we ordered, they 'QC' us in every possible way... Judging if we were big enough to finish the amount of servings we ordered, whether we should remove any platter. It was a very uncomfortable experience with the service crew. They basically didn't quite allow us to have what we ordered (which initially was amusing)... But turned out annoying when it was repeatedly done throughout our ENTIRE meal. We had to constantly argue and justify to the staffs that we can finish it in order to have our orders processed each time we add on more ala-carte dishes. It was ridiculous from our stand point as customers as we are paying for our food, but it felt like we had to beg for them!! The older chinese staff kept coming back to check on our pot before allowing us to order. We left feeling really unsatisfied and disgusted with the service.

I'm honest when I say that I have no bloody clue where I am BUT I trusted Stefan both as a friend and guide as well as his opinion on Singaporean delicacies. So I tagged on quietly, albeit excitedly...for what we will be having at this pit-stop.As we zipped through several streets on foot (thankfully without bumping into random sleazebags that this area is apparently known for), he just mentioned that this ""beef hor fun"" was to die for and their dim-sum was like no other in Singapore. I wanted to troll him right that moment but decided to pass up on the ""oh, you would totally die for some beef *whore* fun huh?"" (Glad I bit my lip...cause we passed by a couple of such late night creatures on the way there).Right...so we arrived and noted that other reviews had been of the ""beef kway teow"" spot right across the street. Apparently, a little history lesson from Stefan, the uncle who owns Mongkok fell out with his nephew who then established that spot and both pointing fingers at each other that each had stolen each others' recipe.Honestly, I don't give two twats about that rivalry. Whoever makes the better dish wins. Since Stefan said that this place has the better ""hor fun""...well, that nephew can go eat some balls.Our dish came out shortly after we placed our order.Beef Hor Fun:1 - there is a lot of beef...TENDER BEEF (reminds me of the ""Mongolian Beef"" dishes in US Chinese Restaurants; meat beaten the crap out off until tender)2 - the ratio of beef to noodles was...practically 1 to 1...which is freaking AWESOME3 - I didn't know it was SPICY (well for me it is)...and for all of you who don't know, my body has never recovered from my chili eating contest eons ago...so I had to really, really, REALLY take my time eating it4 - WINDim Sum:1. nothing spectacular tbh, but I'd eat it again any given day.2. so if this is the ""best"" in Singapore, dang...we have a problem."

Taking this as a good sign, we were seated right away and given a one page, double sided menu along with an order form. Now this is the part where you'll slap me in the face- I actually didn't order dim sum this time around because I was feeling under the weather (stomach-wise.) I only ordered chicken porridge while my husband ordered all of his favourite dishes.Although they don't focus on porridge, I was happy with the result even though it took a while for it to be served. It came with an egg yolk, which gave it more flavour in addition to the pepper. It was pure comfort food and hit the spot! Husband was happy with his dim sum. Overall, great spot for morning dim sum; wouldn't hesitate to come back when my stomach decides to cooperate! Also love how it's easily accessible by public transportation, as the closest bus stop caters to 11 bus lines."

I am of Indian origin, and maybe my discernment for truly fantastic dim sum is a lot more skewed than the norm, but I find the dim sum here to be very satisfying. That being said, I am sure there are some other pretty amazing dim sum places across our city, I've just not been to them yet probably.  There are certain food items I tend to stay away from like glutinous rice and chicken feet, or stew of any kind, but I love the other dim sum on offer here. They boast an amazing variety that is impressive for a local hawker-styled establishment in Geylang. Whilst I am sure this is not the only dim sum place in that vicinity, it's the only one there that I've been to and unless I am introduced to another, I will keep going back.Their regular items like har gao, siew mai, chee cheong fun with minced pork, yam puff, fried prawn dumpling, prawn paste chicken, fried beancurd skin with shrimp, char siew baos, amongst a few others, are all really well prepared in my opinion. The  food here is value for money, we spent about $15-20 excluding drinks per person here with a tonne of food to share between us, and the real draw of this little dim sum joint is that it is open 24 hours a day. That's right, 3am dim sum cravings here we come!Give it a try, its no Michelin restaurant, but it definitely does the job for me!"

The Italian pastas had nice tomatoey sauce so it tasted like genuine Italian, like the dishes you get for $20+ in an authentic Italian restaurant. But here, it was half price. We also tried the tiramasu ($4), and it was decent -- I could see it being priced $12 somewhere else.Really good value.  SO and I agreed we'd come back because we had a nice dinner with a nice conversation for less than $50 in CBD. It was less hectic and better service than nearby Saveur. Here they serve your dishes in an orderly manner and service matters, and you can hear yourselves talk. The dishes won't blow you away, but they're solid. Good size and not too salty.It's a hotel lobby so people with luggage sometimes walk in.

And just in case the big portions didn't feed you, there's also endless free snacks, from cashew nuts and pistachios to marshmallows and cookies. The interior is decorated in a fairly original manner with impressionist paintings and a sober but not entirely minimalist theme. Service is friendly, fast, competent.

The cheese is almost like a juicy chunk of meat!! The bread is nice and fluffy. When you take a bite, the cheese and the bread end up becoming a mini sandwich which has the potential to become a full meal in itself.

The roast meat stall is not cheap, but if you're a big eater, the twin roast set meal with dumpling soup and poached veggies is just the thing. It's about $12 but you can pick a combi of duck, char siew, roast pork or chicken. The dumplings are good - sturdy stuffing of meat with identifiable and reasonably sized shrimp and crunchy woodear in HK style. The Toastbox is like any other Toastbox and it has a good selection of egg tarts, probably targeting the office workers in the neighbourhood who pop by for tea. I'm always baffled by why everyone queues at the Toastbox for coffee. The drinks stall is also Toastbox owned and operated - hello? Food Republic owned by them?

I would say this Novena outlet is a lot tamer than the HV one, since it's not surrounded by other bars that attract crazies who think it's okay to play drinking games years out of uni.*Located in Zhongshan Park next to the Days Hotel, Starker is housed in a modern 2-story building with outdoor seating. From what I understand, the beer they serve is German-style, brewed in Singers, and has a shelf life of 7 days (hence the ""fresh"" factor.)The menu has typical pub grub and pastas. After ordering a cheeseburger, I asked our server to recommend a beer to go with it. He admitted that he doesn't drink beer and couldn't comment. For a second, I was stunned, but before I could even react, he said, ""Let me give you a sample of what we have and you can decide from there."" Great save! He proceeded to give us samples of the 3 beers they have on tap. I thought the beers tasted fruity and at times, a little flat, but overall they're light and perfect for day drinking or al fresco drinking. I ended up choosing the Dunkel, which is the darkest of the 3. Though the cheeseburger was pricey at around $18-24, it was filling and I loved how they used a sesame bun. It also came with fries and a small salad, which I think is worth noting as nowadays there are a lot of chi chi places in Singapore that are charging $15+ for burgers WITHOUT any fries.** Though I find the food and beer a-ok, I really like the space and it's ideal for relaxing and hanging out. +1 star for being close to my apartment.

I'm all up for German drinking establishments / beer gardens, but am I wrong to say that I want something a little more run down with a little more culture... This place has the ambience of a top notch restaurant overlooking a well manicured Zhongshan Park. However, It just seems to me the cuisine and food offerings just don't match the ambience.

With scores of pictures of celebs posing next to the beaming founder, Mr. Chua, one is reminded of how popular and well-known this humble eatery is. Founder's is a teochew-style BKT; meaning to say, the broth is peppery. However, to my memory, the broth used to be *more* peppery which I'd have preferred. But, in any case, it's still good. I had many bowls of the soup, & I'll mention more of that later. We were told that fresh pork ribs are in short supply in the industry. Founder's had to ensure the supplier provides them with only the best & freshest cuts. And one bite shows you exactly what you're paying for. The Premium BKT ($10) uses the long bone ribs. And boy, they were tender, juicy and fall-off-bone. I kid you not. So so so good. Even the regular ribs ($8, I.e. Short bone) were good too. My dining companions preferred these as they were less fatty, but I much preferred the premium ribs. Haha! The surprise of the evening was the fantastic braised pig trotter dish ($8/$10/$12). I thought it was going to be fatty but it wasn't! Again, very soft, tender and flavorful. And the gravy? Sublime. Like, yowza. Slurpsome. I was shamelessly slurping the gravy when no one was looking. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be so good. Well, there you go. The bean sprouts ($5/$6/$8) were good, although unspectacular. What you need to try, however, is the delectable bean curd skin ($3/$4/$5). This is a must-order, IMHO. Silken, soft, satisfying. Yum, yum. Tau Kee never tasted so good. And if you are so inclined, they have pig's intestines & stomach too. I didn't try the former (no, thanks!) but the latter was yummers. Haha! Don't ask me why one is less palatable to me than the other. Iced jelly rounded up our dessert and I also had the refreshing baby coconut too. The flesh was soft and sweet. Quite exquisite. What a way to end our meal! Coupled with good service, and bottomless BKT broth (yes, do not be shy in asking for it to be topped up!!), what more can one ask for?I'm glad I work in the vicinity!!!!Happy happy. :)"

While it is nice that we can refill the soup, the portion is still pretty small for the price. Given that we're in the country with the cheapest Michelin restaurant (only $3 for a meal, or so I heard), I'm sure that we could also get the same bowl of soup for a much better deal else where.

It was delicious eaten with plain white rice. Loved the Chinese donut as well... it was cut into little piece ax which were nice and crispy. Btw, if you know what Chinese donuts are, you know one of life's travesties is when they Re served soggy. Chicken wings were crisp and juicy. The soy eggs were decent.

Useful supplement to whatever the staff at Druggists are already telling you about what's behind each tap.  You get information on what other beer nerds from around the world are saying about this very beer that has your eye.Parking.  Multistory carpark across the street.  Basement parking also available at Jalan Besar Stadium, but a little creepy, but for me nothing compared to the threat of being mobbed by hipsters.  Street parking if you're early.Flights.  I wish they had them, but I just do my own when at Druggist.  So you don't rapidly reach a point of diminishing returns, you ask for about 100ml in each glass  taste it and then move on.  You end up paying for the full glass, but you don't waste good beer and you don't get wasted and you get to be a better person for having a more experienced palate for beer!  Still waaaaay less expensive than tasting single malts...Ok, to close, here's the sermon.  Beer in Singapore is close to where coffee is, a budding culture backed by people with a passion for their product, armed only with what little capital they have and a fierce belief that Singaporeans are ready to dig deeper and to understand the origins of beer, appreciate its traditions and explore the cutting edge of where global beer culture is headed.  I think we're getting there.  There is a nucleus of enthusiasts and a general open-mindedness about spending a little more to try something new, to explore outside the conventional, the commercial and the safe.  Maybe, just maybe that rich amber brew with the off tan head bearing that slightly funky fog of sweat sock going at $17 a glass might be a life changing experience, an epiphany.  The fine folk at Druggists are betting the farm that Singaporeans are willing to take that gamble and I for one am hoping fervently that my fellow Singaporeans are ready to roll the dice!"

Also, they don't allow you to taste test anything, with some clueless and overworked waitstaff at the cashier to collect your money and vaguely recommend you a brew.

The storefront was traditional and simple in look with a small shaded glass door. I was showed to the a counter seat. The place was simple and stylish. Hot towel and hot ocha was served upon sitting.Based on the limited lunch menu (there was only 3 choices for lunch and 6 choices for donburi), I decided on Fuji lunch set ($48++). The set consisted of an appetizer, nigiri sushi (10 pieces), miso soup and dessert.The meal starts with marinated spinach and chawamushi.The chawamushi was served topped with mushroom and greens. Interesting to thinly sliced meat in it. Next course was the sushi which was freshly made in front of me since I was having the counter seat. The sushi was served with crunchy yuzu flavoured apple slices, instead of the usual sushi ginger. The dish was served with a slice of tamago which was juicy and sweet in taste. The sushi was not bad, especially for the truffle flavoured piece in the centre. A piece of yuzu flavoured sushi was a bit overwhelmed by a bit too much wasabi in it.This was followed by a smoky hot bowl of miso soup, filled with seaweed and cubes of tofu.Lastly the meal was ended with the dessert. The dessert of the day was chocolate ice cream. I was looking forward to have Mizu Shingen Mochi 水信玄餅 but it was not available. Another choice given was black sesame ice cream. The black sesame ice cream was quite smooth in texture and rich in taste.Overall the food was great, although it was a bit of stressful meal with so many pair of eyes looking at one. Felt a bit uncomfortable."

The lunch sushi set (Fuji, $48), comes with a good selection of chawanmushi, miso soup and ice cream, plus 10 assorted sushi including the usual hamachi, toro and ebi. What made my tastebuds tingle was the added touch of garnish on all the sushi, such as prawn roe on the prawn and spicy horseradish jelly on the fresh scalllop. Also, I really enjoyed the refreshing yuzu marinated apple slices in lieu of the traditional pickled ginger. Not the cheapest in town, but definitely worth a try if you're tired of classic sushi and are adventurous.Service was so so and knowledge of the product was lacking, but perhaps a quirk from being newly opened.

Now that this is outta the way.. date night few weeks back at Murasaki and what a gastronomic experience it was! We had their kumo menu (priced at $180 per pax before ++) which consists of 2 appetisers, 3 sashimi, 6 nigiri sushis, mini premium don and dessert. Here's what I could remember from the drunk night (we had 3 beers from the bar next door while waiting for our reservation) and it doesn't help that my phone is completely smashed and takes lousy pictures. Appetisers - puffer fish sperm. Was like WHUTTT at first but mm mmm it tastes just like any delectable cold dish with a slight yuzu taste. Like my date would say ""I swallowed"". ;) ok sorry.Sashimi - could only remember the usual chutoro otoro etc. I have no complaints, sashimi was fresh, melts in your mouth etc. But you could get that anywhere to be honest. And I thought they could do with serving a bigger cut of the sashimi. Nigiri - oh my goodness, this is the BEST PART. Uni over Waygu (or was it foie gras) on a warm gently pressed nigri that just screams perfection in terms of taste and skill. I cried eating that piece of sushi. And their Uni are just out of this world. Mini don - do I need to say more for this ? Mini Uni don served with truffle. Everything, including the portion size was perfect. Dessert - AND TO END THE NIGHT, their special water cake. Had to shake it a few times just to see it wobble. It was interesting and different from your usual melon. I would take this over melon anytime. Sake - we had two bottles of sake throughout the whole meal. I can't remember which bottles we had but I have to give props to their hostess who really know her stuff about sake. There's nothing I hate more than asking the staff for recommendations for alcohol and they know nothing about pairing or taste. Overall bill came up to S$1000 I think, didn't pay for it. The sake was quite pricey. Will I go back again? Yes- but probably for lunch this time round. WHAT.AN.EXPERIENCE. (Better than Aoki, comparable to Hashida but still far from Shinji)"

I believe the pumpkin is pureed with chicken stock. I like that it's not overly creamy and you can still taste the grainy pumpkin in it. Pine nuts are thrown in to give it that nuttiness and crunch. The bowl is more than enough for sharing between 2. We didn't finish this.For variety, we ordered the Plato Mixto for Two ($16)- 6pcs of mini cheese quesadillas, 4pcs el toro's special bbq wings and 2pcs jalapeno poppers. S loves the cheese quesadillas but i thought it to be too plain. Some meat would be nice. Then again, i'm too much of a carnivore. The wings are meh but the cheese stuffed jalapeno poppers are really interesting with the spicy vinegar kick. The Cuban Chimichanga ($16 with chicken, $18 with beef) was what i went to El Toro for. As you can see, it's fully stuffed with the minced Beef. This is the ultimate comfort junk food. The meat is really juicy and well flavored. I can't believe i'm saying this but there's a little too much meat. The juices from the meat made the fried tortilla soggy and i didn't get that flaky and buttery texture that i so crave. A little more of that cheese would be awesome too. Nice dish nonetheless. Is El Toro good? Sure it is. I would come here instead of Margaritas anytime (terrible service and expensive food that is mediocre). I shall make it my mission to review all the Mexican restaurants in Singapore."

It may be a little expensive, but considering the amount of food and ingredients that they serve, it's pretty worth it. Some of my recommendations include the eltoro Signature Sizzling Fajitas, the Chicken and Avocado Quesadilla, Brazilian Chicken and Chilli Pizza, and the Puerto Rican Paella. It is fresh, good and really generous in their serving.For vegans and vegetarians, there are a whole lot more to choose from! el toro even has a speical menu dedicated to the veggie lovers!

I also got to try the crepe rolls which were not too bad, crispy with sweet pork floss within. I'm glad to have options for Taiwanese style breakfasts when I need them in SG.

The sugar syrup also doesn't blend into the dessert well and is left at the bottom of the bowl. Another disappointment is the soya milk which is quite watery. You can get better soy beancurd at Selegie soya bean at two other places - near the entrance of Geylang road after Paya Lebar MRT (which is a long walk from Yong He. Look for the blue sign), or the opposite side at Sims Ave after Aljunied Station at the lower numbered Lorongs.The redeeming factor here is that you can choose another option, which is to get the meesua/mianxian or the nice floss bun with egg.

Lucky for us, we drove to get there and parking wasn't a problem.A good number of patrons were mostly families with children and the open field in front of the cafe allowed these toddlers to run around freely and play. We happen to visit the cafe on a Sunday so we had the brunch menu selection. For starters, we ordered the Curried Pumpkin and Corn Soup. As for our main course, my boyfriend who is a fan of steaks, decided to order the Ribeye Steak (200grams) while I went for the Melba Burger. To avoid having our food all at once, we requested for the soup to be served prior to our main course. However, everything was served at once much to our dismay. The soup came with four slices of parmesan naan which was a good attempt at matching the curried soup although, did not compliment it. A simple soft roll would have done the job. On another note, thumbs up to the taste and flavor of the soup. It also looked fantastic and the aroma drew us in even more. The Ribeye Steak that my boyfriend ordered was unfortunately a letdown. He had a choice between the Black Pepper or Béarnaise sauce which he chose the latter. It tasted good, but did not go well with the Steak. Moreover, his steak was mildly seasoned and unevenly cooked (he ordered medium rare). The shoe string fries on the side tasted better than the star of the dish. It was golden brown, crispy, and flavorful. The steak also came with salad in balsamic vinegar dressing that was light and refreshing.My Melba Burger looked great. Pieces of bacon were stuffed between the buns along with a perfectly cooked medium rare beef patty and home-made relish sauce. It tasted good, but lack the depth in flavor that would have made me crave for more.Service wise, the staff did not pay much attention to us probably due to the influx of customers. We felt that the service was more of a routine to clear out tables for incoming customers rather than to create that service moment that could have left us with a good impression.Overall service aspect made our experience with cafe melba a mediocre one although the food was not bad. It was however not worth the price we paid and we expected a lot more from them. A few minor tweaks especially in the service aspect would have guaranteed my return."

Unfortunately, it tasted very much like American-Italian - in this case I suppose it'd be Australian-Italian although I haven't had Italian food in Australia. It'd probably be the equivalent of having pasta at Buca Di Beppo in California. I liked that the flavours were strong, but what I enjoyed about the dish ended there. It wasn't refined at all - it tasted heavy and cloying, and not in a good way the way comfort food can be. The ravioli skins were far too thick - imagine fat floury soggy dumpling wrappers - and were stuffed with cheese that was the wrong texture. The hazelnuts also ended up adding to the density of the dish as well, when I could've used some herbs or greens to lighten and freshen the dish.I'm giving it three stars overall because I'd try some of the other (probably non-pasta) dishes if I do go back. Ambience overall was cute, though I can see why another reviewer said it leaned toward ramshackle rather than rustic."

Specifically because it is so good for kids. A large field for kids to run around in, a sand pit, and their own Bouncy Castle. While it sits next to a busy main road there is a fence keeping the children playing in grass and not traffic. With ample outdoor seating there is always a full patio of parents enjoying some quiet time while the kids run wild. When it is time for the kids to come back and eat they have a reasonable set kids menu that includes drinks and a dessert. Also the menu is a paper placemat with it's own coloring, activities, and colored pencils. I find the food to be good, it isn't the best food in town, but I certainly don't dislike eating here. I have ordered the Chicken Schnitzel burger before and forgotten that it is too much chicken and almost impossible to eat and enjoy. The Burger is good, the wood fired pizza is also good. The price does feel a bit expensive, not outrageous in Singapore but a bit high, worth it for the distracted children though. The service has been good, a variety of wait staff, all who can help you and take your order, things do get a bit slow, but they do get slammed and busy.As I side note, while I have not experienced it, apparently they are more than kids and castles, they have live music and ladies night throughout the week as well.

Arrived almost instantly, with steam blazing hot coming out of the pancakes and a horrible texture that can only be achieved with microwaved-old-food. Tasted pretty horrible and the garnish of half a sliced banana was just sad. Was served with what tasted like cheap syrup rather than a maple sauce or anything remotely nice. Had the rosti as well. Did not add salt at all and the ""poached"" eggs were kinda hard boiled. Nothing was seasoned properly. Kinda disappointing because this was in my memory a great place to eat at. Prices are still high. Ordering system was good and efficient but poorly planned on some tables. The iPad was placed in the middle of 2 diners eating which to me was pretty poor thinking. The floor around me was wet and had food all around telling me that the servers were pretty oblivious to things going on around the restaurant. Pretty sure this does not happen that often here but this particular experience was exceptionally poor. For their prices & the amount of people that were there while I was there at 4pm, they really should have some sort of consistency towards their cooking with a full team of chefs in the kitchen."

The decor was fresh with an Australian vibe so quite pretty. However, I don't like the idea of ordering on iPads. There is always some confusion about whether an order was confirmed or not.We ordered a Greek salad and sweet potato fries.The salad too bad at all, perhaps the dressing was a little on the sweet side and there wasn't enough feta to counteract it. I was just disappointed with the choices -very limited. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries came in a generous helping and were pretty tasty.Overall, it was okay. Nothing special."

The coffee here is the best in the east side of town and is pretty near my place. Happiness!I prefer ordering a piccolo as its stronger and more aromatic. The glasses for the latte are a little big, so the coffee gets quite weak and diluted. I've got to say, the service here is pretty good! The waitresses seemed a little hesitant and inexperienced, but yet were friendly and polite.Also, when I asked about the latte tasting weak, the barista came over and recommended the piccolo. After that I noticed they only charged me for my first order. When I brought this up, they said the piccolo was on the house as I was unsatisfied with the latte. :)The food here is of good quality! Ive tried the breakfast menu and was very satisfied with the eggs Benedict and big breakfast. Prices are a little steep but take advantage of the promotions on at the moment!Weekday mains charged at 25% off, while on weekends, you get a free coffee when you order a brunch main before 4pm! Not sure when the promo ends but i was just there last week and it was still on!The rib eye sandwich and chicken pesto sandwich were both lovely, nestled inside very yummy bread. However the buns for the Melba burger were a bit too doughy for me, though the ingredients inside we're fresh and the beef patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare juicy delight.Great ambience and it's great for families as there's a large field out front, and I've seen an inflatable bouncy castle on weekends!"

Lucky for us, we drove to get there and parking wasn't a problem.A good number of patrons were mostly families with children and the open field in front of the cafe allowed these toddlers to run around freely and play. We happen to visit the cafe on a Sunday so we had the brunch menu selection. For starters, we ordered the Curried Pumpkin and Corn Soup. As for our main course, my boyfriend who is a fan of steaks, decided to order the Ribeye Steak (200grams) while I went for the Melba Burger. To avoid having our food all at once, we requested for the soup to be served prior to our main course. However, everything was served at once much to our dismay. The soup came with four slices of parmesan naan which was a good attempt at matching the curried soup although, did not compliment it. A simple soft roll would have done the job. On another note, thumbs up to the taste and flavor of the soup. It also looked fantastic and the aroma drew us in even more. The Ribeye Steak that my boyfriend ordered was unfortunately a letdown. He had a choice between the Black Pepper or Béarnaise sauce which he chose the latter. It tasted good, but did not go well with the Steak. Moreover, his steak was mildly seasoned and unevenly cooked (he ordered medium rare). The shoe string fries on the side tasted better than the star of the dish. It was golden brown, crispy, and flavorful. The steak also came with salad in balsamic vinegar dressing that was light and refreshing.My Melba Burger looked great. Pieces of bacon were stuffed between the buns along with a perfectly cooked medium rare beef patty and home-made relish sauce. It tasted good, but lack the depth in flavor that would have made me crave for more.Service wise, the staff did not pay much attention to us probably due to the influx of customers. We felt that the service was more of a routine to clear out tables for incoming customers rather than to create that service moment that could have left us with a good impression.Overall service aspect made our experience with cafe melba a mediocre one although the food was not bad. It was however not worth the price we paid and we expected a lot more from them. A few minor tweaks especially in the service aspect would have guaranteed my return."

I was pretty hungry and considered getting the Mega Melba Cooked Breakfast, an upsized version of the Full Melba, which was $36. The Mega Melba doubles the portions of everything but the eggs, and what I really wanted was more eggs, so I stuck with the Full Melba.It says on the menu that you're not allowed to share the Mega Melba, or in their words ""can't be splitted"". That's not very nice... I wonder if they would have a problem with their customers sharing any of the other dishes? Is the Mega Melba too good a deal? If anything it would make their pricing a little more decent as $25 veers on the side pricey for breakfast. They did however provide a glass bottle of water and cups without us having to ask which I thought was nice considering how many cafes these days won't even serve you tap water.Overall, I can see myself coming back if I'm in the area.

Unfortunately, it tasted very much like American-Italian - in this case I suppose it'd be Australian-Italian although I haven't had Italian food in Australia. It'd probably be the equivalent of having pasta at Buca Di Beppo in California. I liked that the flavours were strong, but what I enjoyed about the dish ended there. It wasn't refined at all - it tasted heavy and cloying, and not in a good way the way comfort food can be. The ravioli skins were far too thick - imagine fat floury soggy dumpling wrappers - and were stuffed with cheese that was the wrong texture. The hazelnuts also ended up adding to the density of the dish as well, when I could've used some herbs or greens to lighten and freshen the dish.I'm giving it three stars overall because I'd try some of the other (probably non-pasta) dishes if I do go back.

While it sits next to a busy main road there is a fence keeping the children playing in grass and not traffic. With ample outdoor seating there is always a full patio of parents enjoying some quiet time while the kids run wild. When it is time for the kids to come back and eat they have a reasonable set kids menu that includes drinks and a dessert. Also the menu is a paper placemat with it's own coloring, activities, and colored pencils. I find the food to be good, it isn't the best food in town, but I certainly don't dislike eating here. I have ordered the Chicken Schnitzel burger before and forgotten that it is too much chicken and almost impossible to eat and enjoy. The Burger is good, the wood fired pizza is also good. The price does feel a bit expensive, not outrageous in Singapore but a bit high, worth it for the distracted children though. The service has been good, a variety of wait staff, all who can help you and take your order, things do get a bit slow, but they do get slammed and busy.As I side note, while I have not experienced it, apparently they are more than kids and castles, they have live music and ladies night throughout the week as well.

Did not add salt at all and the ""poached"" eggs were kinda hard boiled. Nothing was seasoned properly. Kinda disappointing because this was in my memory a great place to eat at. Prices are still high. Ordering system was good and efficient but poorly planned on some tables. The iPad was placed in the middle of 2 diners eating which to me was pretty poor thinking. The floor around me was wet and had food all around telling me that the servers were pretty oblivious to things going on around the restaurant. Pretty sure this does not happen that often here but this particular experience was exceptionally poor.

Specifically because it is so good for kids. A large field for kids to run around in, a sand pit, and their own Bouncy Castle. While it sits next to a busy main road there is a fence keeping the children playing in grass and not traffic. With ample outdoor seating there is always a full patio of parents enjoying some quiet time while the kids run wild. When it is time for the kids to come back and eat they have a reasonable set kids menu that includes drinks and a dessert. Also the menu is a paper placemat with it's own coloring, activities, and colored pencils. I find the food to be good, it isn't the best food in town, but I certainly don't dislike eating here. I have ordered the Chicken Schnitzel burger before and forgotten that it is too much chicken and almost impossible to eat and enjoy. The Burger is good, the wood fired pizza is also good. The price does feel a bit expensive, not outrageous in Singapore but a bit high, worth it for the distracted children though. The service has been good, a variety of wait staff, all who can help you and take your order, things do get a bit slow, but they do get slammed and busy.As I side note, while I have not experienced it, apparently they are more than kids and castles, they have live music and ladies night throughout the week as well. May have to come back here and try it one evening."

They have a bouncy castle which will occupy the little ones for days. There was a special event for Chinese New Year and it was fun with Lion Dancing and face painting, arts and crafts, balloons, etc. Brunch is simply a breakfast menu and I was not impressed. I couldn't order a sandwich till 11:00 am so I was disappointed. The bacon was steamed and I felt bad the rest of the day. One piece of toast was not enough and I waited 45 minutes for a second $4.00 piece. Dry, cold and everything else had been consumed. The service was horrible. They were busy--I'll give them that--but the drinks were super slow, the food just average and waiting for the toast infuriating. And, they didn't care. The tip was included in the bill and I tipped more so they got more than average for a bad experience. I will say the people at the restaurant were some of the best looking folks on earth. Lots of ex-pats with about a dozen languages floating around. Eggs, toast, bacon, a breakfast sandwich, two juices and it was $75."

Lucky for us, we drove to get there and parking wasn't a problem.A good number of patrons were mostly families with children and the open field in front of the cafe allowed these toddlers to run around freely and play. We happen to visit the cafe on a Sunday so we had the brunch menu selection. For starters, we ordered the Curried Pumpkin and Corn Soup. As for our main course, my boyfriend who is a fan of steaks, decided to order the Ribeye Steak (200grams) while I went for the Melba Burger. To avoid having our food all at once, we requested for the soup to be served prior to our main course. However, everything was served at once much to our dismay. The soup came with four slices of parmesan naan which was a good attempt at matching the curried soup although, did not compliment it. A simple soft roll would have done the job. On another note, thumbs up to the taste and flavor of the soup. It also looked fantastic and the aroma drew us in even more. The Ribeye Steak that my boyfriend ordered was unfortunately a letdown. He had a choice between the Black Pepper or Béarnaise sauce which he chose the latter. It tasted good, but did not go well with the Steak. Moreover, his steak was mildly seasoned and unevenly cooked (he ordered medium rare). The shoe string fries on the side tasted better than the star of the dish. It was golden brown, crispy, and flavorful. The steak also came with salad in balsamic vinegar dressing that was light and refreshing.My Melba Burger looked great. Pieces of bacon were stuffed between the buns along with a perfectly cooked medium rare beef patty and home-made relish sauce. It tasted good, but lack the depth in flavor that would have made me crave for more.Service wise, the staff did not pay much attention to us probably due to the influx of customers. We felt that the service was more of a routine to clear out tables for incoming customers rather than to create that service moment that could have left us with a good impression.Overall service aspect made our experience with cafe melba a mediocre one although the food was not bad. It was however not worth the price we paid and we expected a lot more from them. A few minor tweaks especially in the service aspect would have guaranteed my return."

The pizzas are the thin crust variety which is perfect for when you're feeling peckish and not wanting to feel too full too quickly. I'd really recommend the Chilli Crab, my Favorite among the lot we chose. Truffle fries were decent, as with the flat whites. Spotted their promotion on margaritas when I was in the Ladies midway through our meal and decided to get a carafe of Strawberry Margarita to ease into the evening. Frozen margarita was a good idea; tangy refreshing and very much welcomed on the palate after too much carbs between two girls. A word of caution for the slow sipper though, frozen beverages doesn't take too kindly to our harsh humid weather so it didn't take too long till we had a quarter of our carafe left with unattractive slush floating on lukewarm pink liquid - and we were seated indoors!

There was a special event for Chinese New Year and it was fun with Lion Dancing and face painting, arts and crafts, balloons, etc. Brunch is simply a breakfast menu and I was not impressed. I couldn't order a sandwich till 11:00 am so I was disappointed. The bacon was steamed and I felt bad the rest of the day. One piece of toast was not enough and I waited 45 minutes for a second $4.00 piece. Dry, cold and everything else had been consumed. The service was horrible. They were busy--I'll give them that--but the drinks were super slow, the food just average and waiting for the toast infuriating. And, they didn't care. The tip was included in the bill and I tipped more so they got more than average for a bad experience. I will say the people at the restaurant were some of the best looking folks on earth. Lots of ex-pats with about a dozen languages floating around. Eggs, toast, bacon, a breakfast sandwich, two juices and it was $75."

Decided not to take any chances and called to make reservations. Boy... Were we glad that we did. Upon arriving 5 mins after, groups of families and friends started to stream in. Seriously, this quiet hidden gem of a restaurant is doing well on a Monday night!! I loved the fact that the restaurant had an over-enthusiastic manager that made my bf and I feel at home and comfortable. At that instance I thought to myself, this was going to be a wonderful experience. And I was right! Our orders included: 1. Starters - Fried calamari- Honestly, It wasn't love at first sight. But upon tasting it, it really was quite good. The batter had to be light to bring out the freshness and sweetness of the calamari. Anything heavier it would have not done the poor calamari justice. 2. Mains - Hand made Tagliatelle with wild mushroom and minced beef sauce - Ok people this is worth every calorie! The taste of the porcini mushrooms infused beef sauce was just the bomb! Not to mention, the hand made eggy tagliatelle was al dente, complemented the sauce very well! 3. Mains - Penne with crab meat in light tomato sauce. - The crab meat with the light tomato sauce was pretty good too but I wished it would have been lighter in taste with bigger chunks of crab. This was just ok for me as I had better ones else where. Overall, I had a great time! Homey, Good service with good food that's affordable, what's not to like. The only thing I wished was that they had ample parking. Best way is to park at United square, then walk towards where the taxi stand is (near toast box). Take that exit, and walk towards the building to your right, It'll be the closest to the restaurant. We will definitely be back to try other dishes!! Good stuff!"

It's Daluca"".So there we were last night, at Da *space* Luca, a little Italian restaurant run by a rather quiet Italian lady. We had the 300g burrrata ball to start, and that came with some sweet slices of tomato and lightly cooked spinach. The cheese was especially fresh and bountiful, easily satisfying the four of us. For mains, I had the squid ink spaghetti special (with cod fish and shrimp in a tomato sauce), the dude had stracci with braised rabbit (I've never come across stracci before but it looks like a cousin of ziti) and our two friends- in-the-know had risotto with truffles. All the pasta was homemade and fresca, which while i don't like comparing restaurants, made Da Luca a contender with La Nonna. The risottos smelled and tasted really good. However, both our pastas seemed a little under seasoned  and hence, flat. This could be totally fine for someone else because I do like stronger flavored food at this point of my young life. I did like that all the seafood was fresh but somehow the flavors didn't sink in with a punch and I had to do the salt & pepper shake. We unfortunately felt the same about the house glasses of red (a chianti) and white wine, which is sad because I remember tasting some great wines in Tuscany on my travels there. We tried half the dessert menu (tiramisu done with sponge cake, apple tarts and ice cream) and it was fine.The great thing about Da Luca is that they serve Italian portions with the freshness you'd expect from a true blue Italian and I appreciate that. Prices are reasonable too. The food will make most happy but doesn't knock your buds out of the park. In other words, great choice for repeat visits, maybe not for that special occasion (and that's probably the more profitable way for the restaurant to go anyway!)."

I always wanted to visit Antoinette at this location but it is kind of out of way from where I frequent when I am in Singapore. The day before I am flying out, I decided I must trek my way here. Like what another yelper has mentioned, this location is a bit of a walk from Lavender station (subway/mrt). Saw the Antoinette logo from afar. The tea salon is somewhat out of place among whatever is in the area. AMBIENCE 5/5 The décor speaks elegance, refined and beautiful.  This is what I love about Antoinette, the salon was what I envisioned if I ever owned a tea salon. I have no talent in baking or running a f&b business, so I just have to be a customer ;) The place was supposedly to be calm and quiet, except that this party of 8 at a table nearby was yapping oh so loudly. FOOD 5/5I ordered the La Rose cake which comprises of grand cru chocolate mousse, caramel, almond nougatine, cocoa sponge, grand marnier and dark chocolate chantilly. The description for the cake stated ""exotic caramel"". Not sure what so exotic about the caramel. However, one thing for sure, the cake tasted absolutely lovely. It was so aesthetically pleasing on the outside, tasted heavenly inside as well. Chocolate lovers would adore this cake. I am not a chocolate lover, I too love this pretty cake. The Antoinette's iced chocolate was not sweet enough. It was a blessing in disguise since a sweeter iced chocolate may be a bit much with the chocolatey La Rose cake. On other occasions, I may want a sweeter iced chocolate. SERVICE 4/5Staffs were friendly, cheery and polite. Not sure if they understaffed, kind of hard to holler down a staff to take order and to get a check. Also, this location does not serve my favorite French toast all day like the one located at Mandarin Gallery @Orchard.Still, I recommend anyone to visit this location and hopefully they would not run into the same party who was basically a nuisance to other patrons who just want to relax in a quiet and relaxing place."

I picked that one - it was really delicious. The other one that I liked was the monotone early grey - it was visually appealing and very tasty! I tried three other desserts - loved each one's intricate flavor! I will have to visit the one in Orchard next time!

Salted egg yolk croissant!!!! The pictures, are to-die-for. The actual product is just alright. The croissant is excellent! But the highlight, salted egg yolk sauce, although runny, was only found in the center third of the croissant. The sauce itself, was also more sweet than salty and had a kind of dessert taste to it. My sister liked her french toast, for me, it is very weird that there is ham and cheese in the the french toast drizzled with syrup. Service is chaotic, to say the least, in Antoinette. The take away/cashier area is always flooded with customers.. And the poor service personnel is overwhelmed and can't get handle all the take away orders and bill payments. The crowd began almost around 11am, and luckily my sister and I arrived just 10 minutes before that. Seems like after 11am, most customers had made reservations. The order staff was flustered, and rather rude when handling my requests. You had to wave at many servers before you were acknowledged. I got the sesame macaroon to go and my sister got the grand cru macaroon. The macaroons melted really quickly. so be careful if you buy it as a gift, it might get melted before you get to give your gift! I might come back for a croissant or macaroon to go, but just that.. Maybe it would be a cute place to hang out in the afternoon, when the place is hopefully less crowded."

We came to collect my mum's birthday cake  and we would like to eat it on premise instead of taking it home as it was a very hot day.  The server said that it is their policy that the cake is for pick up only and not for consumption at their premise - a very strange policy....  We said that we would like to have some coffee and the server claims that there is a minimum charge of $20 per person even though I did not see any signage stating that.   We left the premise quickly in disgust and we will never return to this place !The cake we ordered was a Chloe. It was pretty to look at but that's the only good thing about it.  Overall, there isn't much taste and it is way too sweet.  The yuzu flavor was so subtle that you wonder whether it was there at all.  The mousse was very heavy, one gets a sinking feeling after a few mouthful. The almond sablé  was hard to cut through and not much of almond taste either.  The cake is definitely over-priced at $80 for 20cm and $40 for 15 cm.  Last but not least, the location is not convenient and quite a bit of a walk from MRT - I would NOT recommend visiting this place for a meal or to order their cake."

Now how about some Chili Crab Croissant and Scallion Arlette. A play on Singapore's famous chili crabs with fried 饅頭 (Man Tou), Chef Pang has perfected a droolicious Chili Crab Croissant ($7.50). The sweetness of real crab meat in sweet and spicy flavors is a perfect match to the crisp buttery croissant layers. The level of spice is mild, yet sufficient to linger after the last bite. This tummy is crabby happy with this heartily-filled crescent.Who would have imagined a plain Jane to explode in flavors? The Scallion Arlette ($3.50), a French interpretation of the traditional 蔥油餅 (Chong You Bing), was surprising in flavors and textures. With fragrant spring onions and creamy butter in the croissant dough, Scallion Arlette is a savory crunchy addiction without a hint of oiliness (unlike the traditional sort). It takes a lot of will power to stop munching this $3.50 a pop goodness.Made fresh daily in limited quantities, the Chili Crab Croissant and Scallion Arlette are available now at the Penhas outlet at 11am every weekday and 10am every weekend, and at Mandarin Gallery and Sofitel outlets at 12pm.For all the sweet tooth out there, here's a thumbs up! Chef Pang has more sweet croissants in the mix now. Smoky Salted Caramel, intense Matcha Croissant for the everything-matcha zen-ness, savory Quatre Fromage for the cheese fans (like who doesn't love cheese?!), or the Kaya Croissant for the traditional nostalgia?

The environment is cozy and relaxed but the service was super slow and a little unorganized. We tried four cakes, three out of the four were very chocolate driven, more on the mousse/ ganache side. The Orient was the only one that had a different taste profile than the others. The first bite was gentle to the palate and had a good balance of flavor and textures however the excitement dissipated after each bite. The macarons however are excellent, the shells are well made and the flavors of the fillings are balanced. I liked how they had raspberry jam filling with the earl grey milk chocolate ganache. Overall- the macaroons are good - cakes are okay but definitely overpriced so be prepared to splurge a bit and don't have your hopes too high."

The cake was pretty enough. Love the smell of earl grey which comes out nice and strong. Love the crispy biscuit base. The milk chocolate was a little on the sweet side. I would love the cake more if it is dark chocolate, but that's probably just the old taste buds in me not liking sweet things.

Gnocchi is an italian-style dumpling made of the usual ingredients in dough but with the addition of potato and cheese to give a softer, fluffier texture. The tomato-based sauce was the usual classic sort and there's a carbonara version of this dish. This is definitely for the carbo-junkie or just pick this one to share between friends.My friend had a Pancakes with bacon and Mushroom Ragout. The mushroom cream sauce is a personal favourite and I always have it with breakfast options. I loved the pancakes the first round I tried it because they had a slightly crusty exterior with amazingly fluffy inside but a second trip found me really disappointing ones. So I'm not too sure if quality is consistent.We also got the Salted Caramel Religieuse which was made up of two choux pastries and buttercream. It was decent pastry but rather unmemorable.Having a cake in its namesake, Antoinette, this must be the star of the dessert selection. If you're wondering what the bubble sitting on the top of the cake is - it's a raspberry coulis that you can burst to get raspberry sauce all over your cake. (Oddest sensation ever doing that.) That table ooh-ed over the lusciousness of the chocolate mousse base and the thick raspberry sauce.We also had the Nougatine which is one caramel lovers should have to polish up their meal. I can't remember what exactly went inside it but it was just a little pretty pot of caramel goodness.Oh, and as a personal recommendation, pack some of their Almond Croissants back home. The buttery goodness topped with endless amounts of crumbed almonds and custardy almond paste filling is entirely comforting to have at home."

The French toast is soaked in caramel and eggs to perfection, and has the softest, richest cream ever!  Eggs Benedict is done perfectly with the rich sauce, cured ham, and eggs that pop one you dive in to get your slice.The interior decor is girly French, or vintage French.

At that time, only one group with 2-3 persons was ahead of us...But the result was my friends and I only got the last croissant left. Why? 1) No queue number was offered. We were asked to sit at the Xperience Cafe to wait. When the sale began, several groups rushed to the counter. 2) They only served 25-50 croissants everyday in Softel outlet, which obviously cannot meet the demand in CBD. Under this context, it might be more reasonable to cap the quantity each customer can buy. However right now, one customer usually buy 5 croissants at one time. 3) When I called Antoinette's main store, the staff said they still had some stocks on Penhas Road. Alas, why they allocated such a little quantity to its outlet? After tasting the croissant, we should thank the boutique for saving us money. One is enough!

I really love the gravy to the point that I always need extra bowl just for the gravy itself. They're very generous with the toppings too! There are three options for the carbs: kway teow, bee hoon and egg noodles (you can mix one with another but I haven't tried that yet, someone please try and let me know! Haha). There are various topping choices like chicken chop, fried cod fish, various ngoh hiang & pork, etc. I tried the cod fish with egg noodles (around $5 or $6) and it's such an excellent combination. The gravy though, is sooo flavorful, comforting and delicious! Totally adding this to my list of supper food and worth a visit for tourists too.There is always a line even during supper but it moves very fast, and 'choping' seat is pretty easy because a lot of other stalls in that hawker center close earlier than Zhen Hao lor mee.Note: pretty strong garlic after taste, try at your own risk and prepare some mints. :p"

Children likes me. Lol!!Initially I thought of picking Chabuton for lunch but seemed like the kids were keen on having Tonkatsu for lunch, so I told my friend let's get lunch at Saboten.FOOD : 5/5I ordered the Chicken Katsu Gozen Supreme which consisted of 1 Chicken Katsu, 1 fried prawn and 1 mini tenderloin Katsu. This set comes with rice, chawanmushi and miso soup. So my friend mentioned about this sesame in the bowl which I had to grind and then add the Tonkatsu sauce. Would someone grind it for me? ;-(The staff told us the sesame sauce and Yuzu sauce for the cabbage. Btw, rice, miso soup and cabbage are refillable. My Katsu Gozen turned out great, every piece of meat was so crispy and tender. The fried prawn reminded me of this Tonkatsu restaurant Wakou in Tokyo. So oishii おいしい!! :9    I wish the menu will offer a set with fried prawns only. AMBIENCE 5/5I like the ambience very much. It was nice and quiet. SERVICE 4/5The service was excellent, they refilled my iced green tea and those cabbage (I did not eat any) promptly. I was about to award them 5 stars until I just remembered ... where's our dessert? Each of the set we ordered supposed to come with dessert :(  Nevertheless, service was wonderful overall. Just don't forget our dessert the next time :DDefinitely an excellent Tonkatsu restaurant one can visit. Great food and reasonable pricing!"

The lunch and dinner sets are great value, which comes with free flow of high quality imported Japanese rice, miso soup and cabbage as well as a sorbet to end the meal.  Lunch sets are around $20-25. A little expensive, I know, but particularly worth it if you are hungry. The Loin Katsu more often than not is crispy on the outside and fatty and juicy on the inside. Definitely my favourite Katsu chain in Singapore. I believe the T1 location is slightly better than the Millenia Walk location in terms of quality. Overall, if you are hungry and are willing to spend $20 on a worthwhile lunch, then look no further than Saboten."

I miss the Grandma's that are more centrally located - mostly the Suntec and Novena outlets that I frequent. I found Grandma's a few years ago because of cheap beer! Well, as cheap as it gets in Singapore when Happy Hour is not available - like, early in the afternoons or later at night. At Grandma's, it's always Happy Hour prices for Tiger, Kirin and Erdinger and at less than $5 / $9 per pop, it's definitely a good deal for me. Grandma's has a menu of generally Peranakan-inspired dishes, mixed with Chinese and Malay dishes such as char kway teow and Nasi Lemak - all of which are decent as my take is that the dishes are mostly slightly too salty in general. My all-time favorite dish here is the Sago Gula Melaka (but then again, I like SGM from anywhere) - paired with an ice cold Kirin. We walked past Grandma's in the afternoon and saw that they had some promotion for a main + drink + dessert that was reasonably priced ($6.90 - $12.90) and I got lucky because I was craving pasta, and there was one dish on the menu that fit that bill. I have to say that the pasta actually was decent! I am highly picky about my pasta, especially since I got back from Italy a few years ago - only one place in Singapore actually satisfies my craving for real, but that's another review for another day. I definitely give Grandma's pasta props when it comes to taste. I wouldn't fault the pasta itself because they probably cooked it instant noodle style, but ohwow - the sauce was definitely yummy. The dish came with a leg of chicken, and that was awesomely yummy too. Grandma's chicken has always caught my sense of smell, but I'm never hungry enough to order a rice set that has one, and have never wanted to pay for a piece of that chicken a la carte because the cost logically doesn't justify the smell (~$7/piece if I'm not mistaken). It was definitely well marinated because the juicy chicken leg not only smelt good, it tasted the part too! My little tip here would be to request for their sambal belachan instead of having the sambal chilli that's served on every table - you definitely won't regret it. My small gripe is that the belachan is a little too salty for my liking but I'll take that over the chilli whenever I'm given the choice.Overall, I think Grandma's is good if you're just there for beer and dessert, or lunch but it's generally overpriced for the portions that you get ordering a la carte. The only exception might be their Nasi Lemak dishes, those look really huge in terms of serving size but, I've only ever seen them from far (ie. on other patron's tables)."

Just be careful if you drink these, alcohol content is nearly twice what you get from beer. The food is good and very well priced, the Ribeye Hor Fun and the Mee Goreng Pasta had great flavor with the pasta getting the edge on spiciness.

It's hard to find (ok for someone who lives in Clementi and drives as far as Orchard) and those in the know have kept the local secret pretty well. Hotplate BBQ basically hits the a couple of important Singaporean hawker food points: its affordable, the seafood is fresh and of a good size and there's a long ""queue"". I'm reasonably certain the stall is so leychey to get to and the wait time on weekends long enough that putting up this review will not bring too many people to the yard.My dear aunt was introduced to the aunty owner of Hotplate BBQ, which meant we could call ahead and reserve the items we wanted and the aunty remembers how we like our seafood cooked. The barbequed fish, prawns and flower crabs are excellent here, as is the special uhh cincalok type sauce that is made on request. The sambal chilli isn't bad either.The sambal sotong, stingray and lady's fingers are decent as well but didn't knock my socks off like the 8 prawns I ate. Yes I ate alot and you'll generally find yourself doing the same. When my aunt brought my cousin along for a 5 person meal they ordered 8 grilled fishes. Other than seafood, the stall sells 2 types of vegetables (lady's fingers are one of them) and a very simple fried rice that does the job. Word is the coffee shop owner restricted the types of non-seafood dishes they could sell so that it wouldn't compete directly with the other stalls. Almost everyone comes here for the BBQ seafood but as a spillover effect from waiting up to an hour on Fridays/Saturdays/PH's, people order from the tze char and satay/ grilled wings stalls.How much did our meal cost? We had 9 dishes (2 fishes, 1 plate of sotong, 1 plate of prawns, 1 large and 1 small plate of fried rice, 1 plate of lady's fingers, 2 stingrays) for $90. Yes thank me and don't tell your friends ok? The wait time is long enough as it is."

The place serves a large variety of food, ranging from Indian to Western food. What I like most about this place is the sea view and the breeze.On to the food itself. I ordered the laksa, which contained some thick bee hoon, prawns, bean sprouts, quail egg and so on. I round that the laksa gravy was really delicious because it was fragrant and contained a lot of dried shrimps in it. Being a soup/gravy fan, I actually finished most of the gravy here. We also ordered satay here, and all of us found that the satay was really tender and juicy.Overall, we found that the food here is good with a killer view, but do note that the place is rather inaccessible to those who do not have a car."

For the entrees, we had the orange duck, beef cheek, pork confit, and a fish. Every single dish was perfectly executed and the meat were all very well done - great on flavor and not overdosing on salt.

Didn't realise I haven't visited for like a year (always wanted to bring friends but didn't because it's honestly not very accessible unless Grab/Uber has promo codes). Food:Ate the Ribeye steak ($26), but now the sides come as default fries (add $2 for Truffle fries) and salad. Ordered Medium Rare. At first glance, the color seemed more Medium or Medium-Well. However it's still surprisingly tender, as per medium rare, and flavourful. In fact, I forgot to dip my meat with the sauce (provided in a sauce dish). Fries were also decently fried, not too oily or salty, but still crisp. Salad is relatively fresh. Overall serving is pretty decent, you can see the picture I've uploaded.My friend and I both ate the steak, so I can't comment on the other food. However, menu has also been updated compared to 2 years ago, so check out the pictures :DVariety/Price:Price has evidently increased for the mains (based on previous reviews). Ice lemon tea is still the same price. However the quality still remains, although I wish I could have more variety in the sides. Oh and did I mention they have a 3 pints for $33 deal, and you get to choose beers like Asahi Black and Kronenbourg rather than typical Heineken/Tiger. It seems like they have a tie-up with Brewerkz too.Overall:Atmosphere still good. The area is well ventilated, and you can be there after office without breaking much of a sweat. Now the only concern is how to get there early to beat the crowd... P.S. I want the carving board again. It's sad they replaced the board with a place ):"

Her attitude and tone was extremely derogatory and it was as if she's lecturing me. If your chefs didn't cook it right in the first place, you should humbly accept the feedback and accept the request to change the steak and not talk in that kind of attitude towards your customer! I was extremely appalled by her attitude but didn't want to create a scene so I didn't push the matter further.

I opted for a Chinese-style dinner, as the menu included all my favourite dishes, like crispy cereal prawns, lemon chicken, tom yum and braised kalian with oyster sauce. The food was excellent and my friends and I enjoyed the ambience thoroughly. We were also impressed with the service provided. The service staff were so efficient clearing our plates and serving us throughout the course of the dinner, one friend said they were almost like ninjas.

I'd definitely come back here for future celebrations!"

All was well enough, however it too more than 40 minutes to get our food! I'd have been more upset (in addition to starving!) except that it's easy to see why.

Looking at the menu, one could not help but spotting the localised burgers and over the top milkshakes. Not wonder there was so many families dining in here.Shiok Burger (S$12.90)Crispy deep fried chicken thigh, sliced tomato, crisp lettuce and sunny side up egg, topped with spicy chilli crab sauce on toasted sesame seed bun. Served with cajun fries.Although the sauce was not usual spicy, sweet, eggy sauce which usually associated with the chilli crab, but the sauce here held itself with its spicy and eggy taste.Big Boss (S$17.90)Chef's specialty burger - tender & juicy beef + mutton patty, accompanied with crispy fried onions, sliced tomato, cucumber, crisp lettuce & purple cabbage slaw, smothered in the all-time favourite satay sauce on toasted charcoal bun. Served with cajun fries. The patty which was made up of a mixture of minced beef and mutton was surprisingly free of the usual gamey taste that was usually associated with mutton.  The Big Catch (S$12.90)Buttermilk-battered dory, crispy fried onions, sliced tomato & crisp lettuce, topped with tartare sauce on toasted sesame seed bun. Served with cajun fries.It looked great with 2 huge pieces of battered fish in it. Best had it as soon as it was served as the cold air con softened the batter easily.Dainty Trio (S$10.90)Deep fried chicken, accompanied with crispy fried onions, sliced tomato & lettuce on mini toasted sesame bun.Interesting version of sliders with the battered onions creating the wow.Grilled Free-Range Chicken (S$14.90)Signature chicken thigh cooked sous-vide to retain its tenderness and flavours, then pan-fried till the skin is crisp on the outside. Served with seasonal vegetables and homemade brown sauce.One of our favourite dishes of the meal. The meat was tender and went quite well with the sauce which we wiped it clean. Like the range of vegetables that was served with it. There's even purple sweet potato.Berry Magic (S$11.90)Strawberry ice cream and jam with fresh strawberries , topped with biscuit roll.It was like an overwhelming dose of strawberry milk.Coco Loco (S$9.90)Creamy coconut ice cream, nata de coco and matcha cookie crumbles , topped with desiccated coconut and drizzled with gula melaka syrup.It may not looked much, but it was a party in the mouth with the chewy nata de coco, crunchy  crumbles, and the rich but not too sweet gula melaka.Molten Chocolate Lava Cake (S$10.90)Served with a scoop of ice cream The cake was served pipping hot, with the hot molten chocolate flowing out like lava easily when cut opened. It was so yummy that we wiped it clean.Strawberry Gem (S$8.90)Strawberry ice cream blended with strawberry milk topped with whipped cream, biscuit roll & ais gem biscuits.Although it was the most colourful of the all 4 milkshakes, this drink was the sweetest among the milkshakes which we tried, giving one a sugar high.Snickerhead (S$10.90)Caramel and peanut chocolate bar, blended with chocolate milk & chocolate ice cream.One would thought that this would be the sweetest among the 4 but it turned not. It was a more like nutty with slightly salty caramel taste.Cookie Crush (S$9.90)Cookies 'n' Cream ice cream blended with low-fat milk and Oreo cookies, topped with whipped cream, Oreo cookie and biscuit roll.Another rich and milky milkshake which was not too sweet.Caramel Popcorn (S$9.90)Vanilla ice cream blended with low fat milk & rich caramel sauce, topped with whipped cream, honey popcorn & caramel drizzle.It looked great with the hill of crunchy pop corn on top. The drink was not sweet while being rich and milky."

Expect more side dishes, burgers, milkshakes and desserts. Started in 2013, Citrus By The Pool is a Halal-certified café restaurant, nestled at Woodlands Swimming Complex, that serves Western and Asian Fusion cuisine. It is a 10-minute walk or short drive from Woodlands or Marsiling MRT Stations. Seeing a lack of chillout places in North, the owner decided to bring the café experience to theresidential estates, offering accessibility, relaxing ambience and good food.Step into the retro-themed space decked with large windows and cosy lights hanging from exposed wooden beams. The restaurant seats up to 70 people indoors, suitable for large group/ family gatherings.Check out their new Mighty Milkshakes ($8.90 - $10.90), available in 6 flavours - Classic Vanilla, Double Chocolate, Strawberry Gem, Caramel Popcorn, Cookie Crush and Snickerhead. Depending on your appetite, you can choose to take on the massive drink on your own, or share it with a favourite buddy.I was pretty full from drinking the milkshake by itself, it's gotta be at least 2-3 scoops of ice cream alone! If you're a caramel popcorn lover such as myself, go for it and do not be afraid of it's looks. It's not as sweet as it looks. Actually, the sweetest amongst these 4 milkshakes was surprisingly, Strawberry Gem. Which would still serve as Big Hit for the kids, with the generous toppings of Gem icing biscuits.Bite into the Little Boss (single patty) $14.90/ BIG Boss (double patty) $17.90 (served with Cajun fries), the chef's specialty burger that defies conventional burgers by combining the best flavours of beef and mutton (BM) in one patty. The burger is about being bold and fearless in its flavours. Accompanied with crispy fried onions, sliced tomato, cucumber and crisp lettuce and purple cabbage slaw, smothered in the all-time favourite satay sauce on toasted charcoal bun, expect an explosion of flavours at the first bite.The idea of mixing beef and mutton together to form a juicy burger patty is a brilliant idea. It held the right amount of moisture in the patty.Look out for Shiok Burger $12.90 (served with Cajun fries), a crispy fried chicken version of Da Burger Bomb with a spicy kick. Savour the crispy deep fried chicken thigh, sliced tomato, crisp lettuce and sunny side egg, topped with spicy chilli crab sauce on toasted sesame seed bun. This is a burger that""ll make you go Shiok!Other new burgers include The Big Catch $12.90 (served with Cajun fries), a buttermilk-battered dory fillet, crispy fried onions, sliced tomato and crisp lettuce, topped with tartar sauce on toasted sesame seed bun.Dainty Trio $10.90 (Fried chicken patty) | $12.90 (BM patty), 3 sliders of your preferred patty, accompanied with crispy fried onions, sliced tomato, lettuce on toasted mini sesame seed buns. Customers can choose between BBQ or Teriyaki Sauce.Citrus By The Pool's signature chicken thigh cooked sous-vide to retain its tenderness and flavours, then pan-fried till the skin is crisp on the outside. Served with seasonal vegetables and homemade brown sauce. I recall the tenderness of Curry Chicken I had at Citrus Bistro at Sengkang and I was not disappointed here, the chicken meat was extremely tender. You could easily remove the meat from the bones with just a fork. Definitely a must-try at Citrus By The Pool.To end off your feast, try one of their Sundaes. Berry Magic is a sundae filled with strawberry ice cream and jam with fresh strawberries and topped with a biscuit roll. There were biscuit crumbs at the bottom of the jar, to add a crunchy bite to the dessert. The creamy coconut ice cream was a refreshing taste to clear my palate. I'm a huge fan of nata de coco jellies and this was filled with tons of it! Matcha cookie crumbs together with desiccated coconut and gula melaka syrup made this one sweet dessert.Overall : Citrus By The Pool is now a location that all foodies who enjoy good burgers should check out this hidden gem. I really enjoyed the nice, relaxing dining location. The burgers are relatively huge for a female appetite."

The noodles are fried to perfection, and the amount of wetness is just nice. However, I noticed that there wasn't any pieces of belly pork fried together with the hokkien mee; this detracts just a bit from the overall hokkien mee experience, but the superb taste of the noodles more than makes up for it. Another big plus is that the plate of hokkien mee was really value for money: at $3, it comes with lots of nice and succulent medium sized prawns. If you are a fan of hokkien mee, be sure to give this one a spin!"

The second and third time we got the pork xiao long bao. We tried a few other items as well for our third visit such as, streamed pork bun and pan fried gyoza. Both of which has soup inside!! The gyoza was my favorite because it was crispy, soupy, and slightly chewy. My husband said that this place has the best xiao long bao because of the soup broth and the meat is better flavored. I agree to that and said that Din Tai Fung was overrated. So come try the famous xiao long bao! Just make sure to test how hot it is by poking a hole into the bao and letting the soup escape before consuming."

The soup is delicious and the noodles are thin and cooked just right.So why no five stars? Their service is often spotty, in this branch in Jurong East, they have quite a few people who don't understand English (we're in Singapore, people!).The staff in general looks grumpy and I find them quite unfriendly. Also, I've been multiple times and never have they topped up my water without me asking for it.

I particularly enjoy the original, foie gras, and ma la flavor. I could probably eat 6 of each flavor on my own! Haha. Gluttonyyyy. Anyhow, the la mian here is pretty decent too. I alternate between the clear broth tonkotsu la mian, and the super spicy and mouth numbing ma la la mian. The latter gives your tongue, mouth and tummy a burning run, but is definitely way more shiok.I also recommend the suan ni bai rou (garlic with lean pork) side dish.

Their eight color dumpling buns are always a must order dish. Their fu Rong egg dish is also amazing with smooth texture. The reason why I rated only 3 is because their poor customer services. No body took our order or gave us menu to start with. And later it takes a long time to serve the dish and missed one item. They took away my friend's credit card and didn't give them back until we came to wait in the queue at the counter for check out. In HK the service is good. We never need to check out ourselves.

You get to choose if you want a mixture of Lean & Fat meat, all fat meat or all lean meat.Finally, I have visited Lai Fa Ba and the trip down was worth it. It's more of a personal touch than having food sent in my footsteps as we get to interact and understand from the shop owner their history to their preparation of food.Entrance of Lai Fa BaThe Interior looks simple with stools and foldable tables but the old school theme of the floor had caught my attention.The display of old school Formica tables, milo tins, Ovaltine tins, metal plates, tinkat, saloon equipment and magazines had kind of make me time travel back into the past.The Coca Cola lovers will be interested in this corner. There was an assortment of Coca Cola bottles displayed in the old school cabinets.Even the signage of Ovaltine is in Mandarin and looks so old and rusty.Though not all on the wall are familiar to me, I'm glad that these decorations do give the magic of a layback feel.Let's take a look at the rice and noodle dishes in a combination with their Wood-Fired Roasted meat.Though we are using the buzzer to alert us when our orders are ready, their friendly crews had actually served their food up to our table.With a variety of items on the item, what would you like to order?Sugar Cane Drinks are freshly squeezed on the spot and sealed. The colour of the drink looks bright and refreshing.With the combination of sauces tossed in the noodle, especially with the use of their secret sambal based sauce, I would comment that each strand of noodle coated has a tinge of spice in every bite. On top of that, the tiny bits of lard had complement the noodles well. The smoky rich flavours of the roasted meat were distinctively aromatic. The premium meat, ""Bu Jian Tian 不见天 "" (Meat ) was said to be used in their Char Siew Meat. Upon ordering, customers get to decide if they want lean or fatty char siew meat. If you are adventurous and do not mind the additional calories, fatty meat is of good choice as the fats literally melt in your mouth. Not to forget about the onsen egg was part of the bowl too.Can't decide which noodle or rice to take while you have limited stomach space? You may want to order combos meat and enjoy the varieties.Roasted Duck Noodle is one of their signatures too. Priding themselves for freshly homemade roasted meat, the roasted duck meat too has distinctive aromatic smoky flavours. The meat was not gamy and in fact, went very well with the combination of springy noodles too. As for the soup, it is not the usual clear soup but its colour was chalky and has hints of salted fish taste.These wings caught us by surprise for they are comparable to what we have personally rated the best Har Cheong Gai (Holland Village XO Fish Head Bee Hun). The outermost layer of wings was shattering thin and comes with a crispy crust. The juicy and bursting with the umami flavours in the mouth are to die for.The taste of fresh ingredients is used constituting to this bowl of shrimp dumplings using ingredients such as black fungus, shrimp, minced meat, water chestnut and spring onions.The dumplings were plump and beautifully shaped, accompanied by some greens in the soup.After understanding from the owner, Lai Fa Ba was previously located in Chinatown, The Scarlet Hotel. As the rental lease was due, they had recently shifted to Bukit Batok. Due to the covid situation with dining in affected, resulting in the increase of takeaway food, the team had actually brainstormed ways to keep the noodles and food fresh in the packaging. That explained their hard work had paid off as I was drawn to the freshness of their food when I first tried it during food delivery.In conclusion, if you are keen on quality roasted meat and do not mind spending a bit more on food, Lai Fa Ba will be a good choice"

Well, since it was our first try at Chir Chir, the first impression of it was not bad. This Crispy boneless fried chicken chunks were tender and crispy, totally a different style from the usual Korean Chicken we had from the other fast food chains. The set is good for 2, coupled with fried potato wedges and rice cakes which were tossed with honey butter sauce and seasoning.Honey Butter Chicken - $28Fried items arrived piping hot and surprisingly these fried chicken was still very succulent on the inside despite the dry look on the outside. Once you bite on it, you will feel that the meat was coated with sweet layer of honey but as your teeth sink deeper, you can taste the marinate of the chicken.The combination of dried cranberries with almond flakes never fail to impress me.Giving so many fried chicken outlets in Singapore, I still feel that Chir Chir will be able to stand out among the competition."

Since opening its doors about a year ago (they apparently moved from Chinatown to West Coast), the restaurant has been garnering popularity and even has a queue now during peak periods, a rare sight around West Coast.  The restaurant has a wide variety of Penang food, ranging from all time favorites like Penang Prawn Noodle, Lor Bak and Penang Fried Kway Teow to Peranakan favorites like Babi Pongteh. Penang Special Hokkien Prawn NoodlesThey do have 2 versions of the prawn noodles, the normal or the Special. Considering that it's our first time, we had to go with the special. What a bowl of delight it was!! The stock tasted very similar to the ones I had in Penang. It was rich, sweet and bursting with goodness and it came with just about everything you can imagine. Big juicy Prawns, scallops , pig Tail, pork ribs and braised pork skin, it was the ultimate sinful delight! Butter Salted Egg Lala This is a first for me. Unlike the usual sambal or garlic Lala (clams), these came stir fried with a butter salted egg yolk sauce. The sauce was not overpowering, which was nice as it allowed the sweetness of the clams to come through. The clams were fresh, sweet, plump and succulent. The only draw back was that it was still a little grainy so there were bits of sand in some of them. Fish Head CurryOne of their signatures here, the fish head curry is pretty good. It looked like a typical Chinese style curry but when you taste it, there was that hint of Assam, which added a nice dimension to an otherwise normal pot of curry. The fish head itself was sufficient for 2-3 people to share and the added Beancurd skin and beancurd puffs made for a wholesome dish. Lor Bak Probably the only disappointing dish for me. While the ingredients (Meat and Prawn roll and Beancurd) was nicely fried, the sauce was a let down. Meant to be similar to the thick gravy of Lor Mee, the sauce was starchy and tasteless. Almost like starched up water. Very disappointing. On a whole, the food here is very good. A lot of it reminds me of the true flavour of Penang, which is very hard to find, and they did a great job bringing the true flavours of Penang to Singapore. Be warned though that there will be a crowd during dinner time."

Other than these daily specials, they have a fix vegetarian Yong Tau Foo Items that is available at all times.Satay gravy over the plate of Bee Hoon was milky and came with hints of lime flavour. Ingredients like mocked prawns and kang kong was used.Satay Bee Hoon - $4.303 sticks of Satay is given and the texture indeed resemble the softness of a marinated meat. You kind of get the idea they are imitating chicken and mutton satay here, however if you did not take further notice to the food, you may have mistaken them for the real ones instead of mock meat.Prawn Roll was one of the common items we ordered every visit. They were crispy fried and served in its golden's brown color with taro fillings and other items.Prawn Roll - $5.80Claypot rice was one of the ""hottest"" item that we can see on many tables. It comes with a bowl of herbal soup with a portion of sweet corn in it.Claypot Rice - $5Black sauce is available at the sauce counter and you can add them to your food if you like. Ingredients include carrots, broccoli, mocked hot dog as well as diced mocked meat.They are one of the few vegetarian places that I will very much like to make a return visit for their varieties are appealing and having said that they have been maintaining their popularity of Vegetarian food in Jurong West for a long time."

We ordered the bak kut teh and the curry fish, and they tasted shockingly close to the real deal! I could almost turn vegetarian just by eating the food here (although I know I won't).

It was 2 differ grading between the dang seng soup and the satay bee hoon.I went back 3 days later and this round try their Yong tau hu with yam rice. They are very thoughtful to split into dry and wet. The yam rice was rather average but their Yong tau hu is very heart warming. Their soup base re dang Seng. My friend order their clay pot rice.

Ice water was only served when requested but after that, the servers were attentive enough to clear our plates and refill our water often. Between the few of us, we ordered:1) Clam Chowder - good amount of ingredients and the clams were juicy and big. Good!2) Steak Frites - a fairly thick slab of beef that is a pretty good cut too! Seared nicely outside and still juicy and tasty! Absolutely best!3) Spruce Burger - for $18, it's a very good serving size. The meat patty is very tender and accompanied with bacon, relish, onion, lettuce and somehow fragrant bun, total package of Yumz. Hubby loved loved loved this. 4) Salmon Steak - my friend had this and she said its nicely done to get a crispy exterior with a moist interior. Nice she said.

It's set in a relatively quite fire station as you head towards Upper Bukit Timah. It's not difficult to get seats on a weekend or a public holiday so I guess that's a plus if you're going with the 'rents who don't like waiting. We tried the Spruce burger, the benny's and pancakes.

We've tried a variety of things on their Mediterranean and Indian menu, and our top favourite is their Butter Chicken ($18) + a basket of Naan ($13). Their naans are HUGE, one piece alone is enough to leave me stuffed. They come warm and crispy, perfect with their butter chicken! Yum. They have really friendly staff who always give good recommendations. However, like the other review, I agree that service is pretty slow, even when the place is empty. There is street parking available around the row of shop houses. We usually park behind the restaurant, and it's free in the day. (Not sure about at night when the other stores open, may be valet parking?)Tip: if you make a reservation using the Eatigo app, you can get up to 50% off!

The place seems to always be crowded, but the turn over rate is pretty fast and if you don't might sharing a table it really shouldn't be a problem. You might have to wait a little for your prata cause of how packed it is. I usually find myself at the tail end of my drink before my food comes, maybe that's why I get a drink after all. I always get their teh tarik, and I highly recommended it, both hot and cold.Foodwise, my go-tos are the kosong (plain), egg and cheese. They are known for their milky gems prata which is filled with condense milk and m&ms, sounds like a delicious dessert combination, but it is pretty sweet. I've also heard they have a good plaster prata! Their curry isn't the usual fish curry, and is very flavourful, but compliments all good well. They also give you chilli, which happened to be my first time using this as a condiment for prata, which also happens to work very well. Overall, amazing no frills prata place, that I guarantee you will leave happy with your food."

A few places offer crispy prata, Enaq is one of the few. The difference is that the prata here is a fine balance between crispy and soft! Really a delight to consume. The curry served might be too little for some, but it was just enough for me. Another thing about the prata that differs from other places was that prata here is served with not only curry, but nasi lemak chilli as well, an interesting combination I must say.The only downsides I would say is that the eating house is quite limited in seats, as well its closing timing at 12am."

The mutton is also of the right texture, not too tough and with the right amount of flavor infused into it, without retaining much of the strong muttony taste.

So imagine my glee when I found this casual, laid back restaurant, situated within the Jurong Point mall. It may seem like an open space, but apparently when I went in, it gave off a cozy feel-at least for me. Whenever I eat here, I always order a hot drink with my meal. They have the best tea in my category because mainly, it's in a big cup and the staff is not afraid of filling it up. Speaking of the staff, they have a diverse of nationalities and personalities in this joint. All of which are very accommodating and they are knowledgeable of their menu.The first time I went here, I had their lunch set which includes a small serving of salad in vinigrette, chicken sausage and mashed potatoes. Being a big eater that I am, it was trully a divine experience for me. When I came back the second time around, I decided to sample their Paella. Coming from a former Spanish colony, Paella is quite common so I was intrigued on their take with this dish. Presentation wise, I loved how it is served in a black mini paella wok, making the dish more vibrant with a lemon wedge on the side. The serving?, definitely fit for one, but if you're watching you're carb intake, you can split it with your friend. The taste? It wasn't spot on European, more of an Asian flair, but nonetheless, being Asian myself, I enjoyed every bit of it.All in all, this is one of many food places I would keep on coming back to. Maybe next time I should try their oysters."

Hai Di Lao is a popular chain of hot pot restaurants founded in Sichuan, China. The chain is known for their exceptional service. Note that Hai Di Lao is not an ""all you can eat"" restaurant and you need to order the dishes individually. FOOD:The broth is very delicious - I tried the chicken, tomato, spicy, and mushroom broths (you can split your hot pot to have four flavors if your dining group is big enough). I liked the chicken broth the best, it was amazing! The broth was good by itself and I enjoyed sipping on it while waiting for food to cook. All of the raw dishes we ordered tasted really fresh. I love the hand pulled noodles because a chef comes to your table and puts on a noodle pulling show with music - a really interesting experience if you've never tried it before! SERVICE:What can I say? This is hands down the best service I've ever had at a hot pot restaurant. We had to wait a while for a table (about 30min) but the waiting area next to the restaurant was super cool. You could sit at a seat and eat FREE snacks such as watermelon, oranges, and popcorn. There was also a FREE manicure area but the queue for that was very long when we went (however, the manicurists gave me a free ticket to skip the line if I came back another day!) When we sat down, we were given hot cloths for our hands and aprons to wear so our clothes wouldn't get dirty. The server also put a white towel over my backpack to protect it from food and little plastic bags for our phones. Our table even had charging cables so we could charge our phones while we ate! Our server constantly refilled our broths when they got too low and helped continuously serve us cooked foods from our pot. Since lunch was a bit busy, multiple servers aided us without us ever needing to flag them down. A few cons:Hai Di Lao is a bit pricey when compared to other hot pot places in Singapore. Ordering individual dishes can really rack up to a big bill.The wait may be long (the cool waiting area amenities helps though). As another Yelper pointed out, the restaurant staff is completely Chinese - their English is super limited. This is a bit weird because I feel like English in Singapore is so widespread and common. Luckily, my friend and I both spoke Chinese and were able to converse with the staff. If you do not know Chinese I recommend dining with somebody who does because the staff will not attempt to cater to English."

Note that you can order half portions of all the food (which is useful if you are in a smaller group so you can try out more dishes). The selling point of this restaurant is that they offer quality hotpot together with a superior service (this last is not always the case).Ok, over to the details and I have loads as this is probably the restaurant I've been to the most since I moved to Singapore. Does that mean it is the best? No,lah, but it is pretty good and I have a friend who adores this restaurant.I simply cannot grant this restaurant a 5 star review as their premise: offering a superior service, apparently only comes in Chinese... And I don't speak Chinese! Luckily my friend does, but the times I've been first to arrive at our regular dinner dates I've been pretty much ignored by the staff. It is true though that the menu can be switched to English so you can get through if you don't speak Mandarin but the service level declines significantly as none of the staff speak English.Nevertheless , I must admit, the restaurant comes with a lot of extra's (for the cynical under us: it comes with a lot of gimmicks): they provide popcorn and fresh fruit whilst waiting, during your meal they give you plastic bags to protect your cell, aprons, wipes and hair ties, after the meal they offer handfuls of mints, snacks & drinks to take home with you etc. Heck, the outlet at 313 even offers free manicures.But over to the main attraction: the food! You can select different configurations for the soup base, my personal favorite are Sichuan and Laksa which are customizable to your taste (less/more heat/oil etc). All soup bases I tried by now have pretty much earned a seal of approval, they are all super flavorful, even the tomato one, which I didn't expect to like as I am not a big tomato soup lover.For the food you cook I would say the most is of pretty good, typically it is fresh. Notice how I say typically?  I had one or two instances where I felt that the crab was not super fresh but it was always still acceptable.  I would recommend following: beef, fish maw, chinese yam, shrimp, lotus root, fresh clams, fried tofu skin and any of the mushrooms. But obviously it depends on your own personal preference and none of the other items I've tried were a huge miss so I would say just pick whatever sounds good to you.Some more thoughts about the condiment bar: at first I found it a bit strange that you had to pay for the condiment bar and I was inclined to skip it but I soon discovered that it hides extra dishes amongst which a yummy appetizer: Sichuan tofu skin noodles (yay, a low carb noodle dish) which I think is a great dish on it's own! It also comes with options for dessert but being a Chinese chain it offers mainly fruit, sweet soup and tofu pudding.Another reason not to grant a 5 star review is the price, although the half portion option offers you some flexibility to stay within your budget, it is more expensive than a typical steamboat restaurant, certainly if you compare it to most buffets. However, I never felt that it was overpriced either. BOTTOM LINE: the food is good for a hotpot type of restaurant, suggest you try it yourself to see if you like the extra's they offer."

The tablecloths are cleaned daily and the cleaners are fast in clearing up the dishes left behind. The most popular stall would be the Manna Korean Food and the rest are pretty much equal. The other stalls sell Chinese, Western (pasta), Mixed rice and Vietnamese food respectively. They do have a new waffles stall as well as a new jelly beancurd stall (Lao Dou).If you're looking to find a seat during the peak hours of 12pm and 7pm, you might find yourself having to wait for a long time.

Well between the long bus ride and the walk we had arrived early, and this Cantonese seafood restaurant in the suburbs was already packed to the gills both inside and out. There was a feeding frenzy of epic proportions as though the food had been for free (of course not).Most fortunately, we sat inside with a/c but right near the high traffic kitchen. A reminder that space is premium in SG. Our jovial waitress kept things moving in spite of the number of very demanding Chinese diners she serviced. We had ordered Silver Seafood Hor Fan (wide rice noodles); HK Kai Lon with garlic; Sri Lanka Crab chili style; and to conclude with Coconut Pudding for dessert.Experience told us to bring lots of wet towels. The chilli crab was simply orgasmic. Not a drop of the savory sauce was to be ignored. Sucked our fingers like nursing infants.

It's outdoor seating, but there's a private section that has A/C. It's popular for chili crab. Cool thing about this place is you get to choose your crab- that's pretty Asian. The pork spareribs are melt-in-your-mouth. There's no bone, but it still has that tender fall-off-the-bone texture. It's super savory and has a lightly sweet taste to it from the fat and marinate. Also, the spinach with salted egg soup is delicious. Yangzhou fried rice has a nice peppery taste. Chili crab is the obvious star though. Not as delicious as Malaysian chili crab (sorry, Singaporeans- I know about the argument between who has the best food- Malaysia or Singapore), but still deliciously spicy and hearty. The mantou (bread) is crispy and soaks up the chili for dipping. One more thing, for dessert, the coconut pudding dessert is amazing. The pudding is in a young coconut and it's sweet and doesn't have any artificial taste to it. It's one of the best Chinese desserts I've had! Clementi is a residential area, so there's not going to be many gwei-loh's or tourists. It's more local since it's not in the town, but the food here is super good."

The drunken shrimp was okay.  I was a bit upset that it wasn't drowning in alcohol.  The server placed the pot over the fire, once it came to a boil, he divided everything to be served.  To my dismay, the prawns itself lacked flavor.  The rice wine was worth a taste, but I've had better.They live fish is also a good choice if you want to get away from the other crustaceans and want something slightly healthy.  Unfortunately, I don't live in Singapore but this looks like a place to bookmark for my return trips just for that pumpkin sauce crab alone!"

It seems a little silly to an American to put sauce on the outside of a crab, but that's how they roll in Singapore. Truly one of the messiest meals ever. I think they must deep fry the crab because the meat is not as moist as when steamed. As a result, it was tough to get at the leg meat.There were a few suckling pigs ordered around us and they looked delicious with really crisp skin.I had to chuckle when I noticed charges for wet naps, tap water, and seemingly complimentary peanuts.

And we found our favourite crab dish so far at Chin Huat Live Seafood. The crabs were fresh, meaty, delicious and OMG just so good. We ordered their signature ""Special Sauce"" crab to try it out. And we were not disappointed. :) Chin Huat has an indoor (air conditioned) and outdoor section so you can choose whichever experience you prefer. I also like it that they have live seafood still swimming in the tanks which are on display. I feel assured that the seafood ordered are fresh and not frozen.All the dishes we ordered were also not too salty and still very very tasty. We had Cereal Prawn, two Special Sauce Crabs, Fish fillet steamed in soya sauce Cantonese style and Vegetables fried with garlic. It was a wonderful combination as the food wasn't too heavy and we didn't walk away feeling like we overate. Great service from the staff who were friendly, polite, attentive and professional enough to take time to give good advise on food choices when ordering.Special note from Dad: The multi-storey car park nearby means there is no stress about parking. Unlike places like Eng Seng Coffeeshop, where the food is cheap but service is really lousy and finding a parking space is an additional nightmare.We will go back again to try the crab in other flavours!"

Skip everything else if tummy space is limited, as the cze char here is fair but not particularly memorable.We had:1) Sauteed Scallops with Asparagus in XO Sauce ($20 for small): decent albeit forgettable, a lovely contrast in soft and crunchy textures, and lively in spice.2) Spicy & Sour Szechuan Soup ($10 for small): surprisingly refined for a neighbourhood seafood joint such as this.3) Hongkong Steamed Giant Garoupa ($38) was unexpectedly done fillet-style, and it was a smidge overcooked. In any case, the fillets were still slightly bony. I suspect this would have been much better left whole.4) Alaskan King Crab in Pumpkin Cream Sauce ($138 per kg): absolute must-try and fantastic. The salted-egg yolk accent was a savoury, and decadent, counter to the sweetness of the pumpkin, and curry leaves and chilli specks lent a subtle heat to the velvety sauce. Seriously the best salted egg yolk sauce ever. We wiped this clean off.5) Alaskan King Chilli Crab: heady with spice, and complementary to the incredible sweetness of the crab. Once you've had Alaskan king crabs, you'll never want their Sri Lankan cousins anymore; I haven't been able to look at Sri Lankan crabs the same way since. A telling factor to how amazing these are: a girlfriend who's mildly allergic to crabs and has to take anti-histamines before indulging, didn't break out in hives even though she ate several crab legs.6) Boston Lobster Noodles: sweet with the essence of the shellfish.

It's only a couple of minutes away from my place and my parents aren't good with corner coffeeshop zi char places, so this is our go-to place. And what a great go-to it is! The food is great, the prices are reasonable and the ambiance is nonetheless comfortable. My wife and I think the pumpkin & salted egg sauce they have, which we had for our crab, is one of the best dishes we've ever had, and by way of comparison, we just went to Le Bernardin in NYC. It's one of those genius combinations of sweet, salty, spicy, umami, and subtle flavors, such as from curry leaf, which distinguish the best of south-east asian food. Also good here are the razor clams and fillets of fresh fish, which you can order as an alternative to a big expensive whole fish, if you already have other dishes and a smaller party. I was not as big a fan of the drunken prawns, although my mother kept drinking the broth, so there was at least one fan there. I think if you let the shrimp marinate in the broth longer (the server insisted on ladling it out for each party member) and add the provided dipping sauce, it's still definitely delicious, just not necessarily a big star like the crab. Overall, I highly recommend this place. You can choose to sit either inside or outside, and if you are outside and have a problem with the mosquitoes, they will provide some mosquito coils."

The drinks stall also sells nice packages of fresh fruit and will make fresh pressed fruit juices.The Japanese stall (one of the newest) is my next choice, although the meat is usually a little on the salty side. There is a western stall that is probably worth a try although the price (usually double) has dissuaded me this far. All in all, if you need a quick bite for a great price - eat here.

The tried the chicken chop, fried rice, fish and chips, on different occasions (in the end I went more than once), and I thought they were all quite good!

They have various sets and curry dishes. sets come with rice, cabbage, miso and pickles. They first serve us the cabbage salad.  the sesame sauce is provided on the table. the cabbage was shredded very thin, which was really nice. the pork came shortly after. it was juicy and not dry. i wouldnt give it higher stars just cause it wasnt a dry crisp exterior. the bottom was a little soggy.  still great..but not amazing. maybe i just didn't luck out...but it was good. would go back n try it another time."

Since there was a seasonal special menu featuring Fukuoka's Mentaiko, we opted for the Premium Mentaiko Pork Loin Katsu (180g) for $26.80 that is generously garnished with seaweed and spring onions. While some might worry that the savoury cod roe would overwhelm the natural flavours of the meat, I thought it complemented the meat very well, in fact better than garlic pork loin ($19.80) or the cheese variation at other places. In fact, the Mentaiko makes the pork tasty enough to wean you off the excessive Tonkatsu or sesame dressing. If you are not a big eater, there is also a lighter version (120g) that costs $21.80. But the pork cutlet is NOT the only reason why one should visit this restaurant. The Chicken Fillet Cutlet Set ($14.80) turned the tables with its tenderness and leaves no grease in your mouth. Now I finally understand why this Chicken Fillet Cutlet beat the Kagoshima Pork Loin to be the most popular item among the Japanese customers.For seafood lovers, there is the deep fried prawns($23.80). It might seemed costly for 3 pieces but the prawns are truly sweet on its own, a wonderful combination with the homemade tartar sauce that boasted crunchy textures. Another surprise came from Ginger Stir Fry Pork ($11.80), a good alternative for those who are abstaining from deep fried food. The caramelized onions and black pepper lifted the ginger sauce, which makes the juicy pork belly slices a perfect dish to go with Japanese rice. I always stayed away from deep fried vegetables as it defeats the purpose of eating healthy but I guess there is always an exception. This Mixed Deep Fried Vegetables ($11.80) are crisp and light, yet the vegetables still retain its vibrant taste. The Sweet Potatoes and Pumpkin Katsu are so naturally sweet that they could very well qualify as desserts. Alternatively, the cold sliced tomatoes ($3.80) work well as palate cleansers. If the Tonkatsu sauce and sesame dressing is not enough, there is also homemade curry sauce ($3) that is mildly sweet and definitely won't cause any internal combustion.Get your cameras ready when the Piyo Piyo Minced Meat Cutlet ($9.80) is served as the egg yolk waits for no one unlike salted custard bun or molten lava cake. Delicious looking as it may look, the dish is bland and the seasoning comes from shoyu dip, which I wish could have been incorporated into the minced meat in the first place. More than just the usual pork cutlet, I think Imakatsu excels in a variety of deep fried dishes which helps it to cater to a wider audience. One can tell about the standards of the food here as majority of the customers are Japanese. Towards the end of the meal, this bowl of pork cutlet katsu was accidentally served to us while it was supposed to be other customers' order. As I witnessed the tantalizing bowl of juicy pork and scrambled eggs being taken away from my table, I noted secretly to myself that this would be the dish that I'll order next time."

The crystal dumpling with mixed veg is also pretty good; we've had that a couple of times. We have tried the non-traditional flavors for bao, like chili crab, and were not impressed. Since that time, if we order xiao-long-bao, we would just get the original.

The location is pretty standard for a shopping mall, although chances are you'll be seated in the open space in the middle of the mall--where passersby on three floors can ogle your meal.

This was pretty much down the road for me and so a reservation was made, easily. We got there at 5:30pm on a Sunday and they were not too busy yet. The service was fantastic. Everything was efficient and no one felt like they were in your face. The food was great and in good sized portions. Our 5 year old really enjoyed her first Korean BBQ experience and loved the BBQ meats. We will definitely be back.We ordered a Beef and Pork BBQ Meat set for 2-3 persons ($65) which included all the little korean side dishes/appetizers, bean and vegetable stew and dessert.  We also had a Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup ($20) a Pa Jeon (Korean Pancake for $18).

There was one korean waitress who didn't speak a word of english, but she was sweet and tried to be helpful. The one waitress who did speak english was extremely bad-tempered, she kept throwing things around on our table, and took very long to get back to us. For example, my mom can't use chopsticks for a number of reasons, there's some problems with her wrist and finger bones. We asked for a fork and she took fifteen minutes to get back to us. It's not like she was busy, it was really early (around 12:15pm) and there was only one other table having lunch. The food was good, portions were generous, super value-for-money, but the service needs help. She didn't even change the grill, though we were there for almost 2+ hours and ordered more than $200 worth of food and drinks. I'm not Korean but even I know that's not okay.

The prawns were generous and the soup stock was definitely tasty; I slurped up every drop of it. Being a beef fan, I ordered the beef brisket noodles, which were somewhat better than the ones you'd find at the food courts I guess. The beef was well cooked and chunky and the sauce was sweet enough.

The dim sum will be their best choice. As John Q. recommends, their xiao long bao is on par with Din Tai Fung. I like that they only steam or pan-fry their dim sum when you order. Sure, it means longer wait but dim sum traditionally is meant to take a while. Plus, if the food tastes fresher that way, why mind the wait right? The char siew rice is another dish I often get. But, if you are picky on your rice, avoid their rice dishes. They are a little stingy with their sauce and their rice is a little undercooked. It happens every time so I am glad they serve it with a bowl of soup. I recommend avoiding their duck. It is very dry and slacking on the flavour. Walk a few blocks to Clementi Market for a delicious duck rice.For dinner, their seafood tze char is well-known. I personally like their stir fry French beans (四季豆). However, their price is a little over the top for your typical below the HDB tze char. There are better options in Clementi so go explore!"

I suppose its because claypot rice is getting hard to come by around this neighbourhood. At $6 per serving, the price is also rather reasonable.After your 15 minute (conservatively!) wait, you get served one times claypot. You get to, as usual, drizzle as much sesame oil and dark sauce to your rice as you like. Personally I put excessive amounts of both, and let it sit there for an extended period of time. This way, the rice at the bottom of the pot gets charred and crispy. You also are able to enhance your culinary experience by using your metal spoons to scrape these charred portions, bit by bit such that every single grain of burnt rice is consumed.The claypot rice here is exceptionally fragrant. To be honest though, as I do not eat claypot rice that often, I am not sure if it is because of the cooking or if it is because of my excessive dumping of sauces. One thing is for sure though - the end product is marvellous!They also serve a black bean soup here, which seems popular enough but I have never tried. Doesn't seem that appealing to me!This rice is pretty kick ass if you dump a lot of sauce, and judging by the queues, the cooking must also be excellent!"

The good thing is the seats inside is only catered for those eating at this outlet, so even if it's crowded elsewhere, you can find a place or two usually.This is the order-from-counter style so you have to queue up to make your order. What I recommend is the ""Nasi Briyani"" - choose the popular Indian style rice and you get to choose your vegetable and meat. There are also other side dishes you can choose but do note they are slightly expensive. For example: 80 cents for an egg. If you can't take spice, I recommend the lime juice which goes well with the spiciness. I won't say it's spicy, in fact it's pretty tame compared to others but what I like most is the chicken - how they so it with the sauce and all that. To TOP it up, you will get a rice cracker. For a meal like this, it cost around $10 including a drink. Overall, I enjoy coming here to enjoy decent Indian food. Helps a lot especially when you are hungry!

I am a carnivore and I don't like to eat vegetables at all.This however means that I am not left with much choice when I go back to my grandmother's house to eat. You see, she is Hakka, and she eats lei cha almost every day. Lei cha, for the clueless, is a bowl of white rice, 5 different sorts of chopped up vegetables, some dried radish and roasted peanuts, topped off with a bowl of soup which is apparently some sort of tea - hence, the 'cha' in 'lei cha'.My grandmother attributes her old age to this diet. At 96, she is a ferocious character. She is able to hold a cane and chase her great grandchildren around the house, nag at her grandchildren for anything and everything.Her lei cha is the traditional sort, which I have never liked.I must however say that this lei cha here is pretty good! The vegetables are less sparsely salted, they are more generous with the peanuts, and the dried radish sends a piquant kick to the back of your throat. Best of all, the tea (i.e. the soup) is less overpowering than traditional versions.In short, this version is more suitable to the tastebuds of the younger generation. For me, it was the stepping stone to accepting my grandmother's version of lei cha.If it helps kickstart a habit that could help you live until a ripe old age, why not?"

It really is nothing more than your typical office canteen or the small food court below your HDB. They have great concept to try to get people to take a break from work or be social. However, their food is likely what drives the social aspect because everyone will have something to complain about. The ambiance is reasonable with bright green fake flowers on the table and clean environment. There are plenty of seating area both inside and outside the restaurant. BUT, their food is terrible. They have the typical mixed rice line - one Chinese style and one Indian style. The Indian one is slightly better although at a much higher price ($6 for a plate of chicken briyani). The Chinese one is reasonable but you will often get undercooked rice or very oily stir fry vegetables. They also have very bad meat selections that has more bones than meat in them. They also have a noodle station that alternates between prawn noodle, lor mee, laksa or fish noodle. The lor mee is decent but for $4, it is not worth getting. Next to that is a chicken rice stall with edible chicken or char siew rice. Again, for $4 a plate, they don't give you enough meat and way too much rice that is not sufficiently flavored by Singapore standard.Besides the stalls, they also have daily specials that are made to order. I have yet to try any of it. This place really tries to take advantage of working crowd with no car or are too busy since there is basically nothing else to eat within a 10-15 mins walk vicinity. I would have given it 1 star but considering that I do return to it quite often, and the occasional tasty fried fish from the Indian stall, 2 stars is about as much as I can give it.If you are visiting this area, make sure to get some good food at Pioneer or NTU before coming over here."

The stretch of stalls where 128 Fish is situated is known for its Bak Kut Teh and Fish/Chicken Porridge, well liked by the neighbourhood therefore seatings around that area may be harder to find.Price is reasonable and quality of food is definitely there."

Price:For ~$10 you can get a bowl of their creation (unagi is real expensive though, your bowl can potentially reach $15). And they do spend some effort in their presentation, so for the price, it seems like they ain't overcharging ylj for the initial visual feast. Overall it's quite filling (if you choose brown rice) so it's quite value for money. Location:It's pretty accessible from the MRT.

From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look any different from an Ajisan or a ""nothing fancy nothing spectacular"" Japanese restaurant but a glance at En Sakaba's menu made us change our minds First impressions, reasonable. With an Asari Miso soup going at $3.00 and some of the starters at $5.00, it had to be one of the most reasonable Izakaya restaurants in Singapore. Being a beef and foie gras fan, the wife had to try their Foie Gras Yakiniku Onsen Tamago Don. At $22.00, the Don came with a rice, premium beef tataki, a slice of foie gras and an onsen egg. The rice was well cooked and came in a pretty generous portion. The beef was excellent. Well seasoned and beautifully cooked, the beef was almost melt in your mouth tender. The wife, who's tried other beef tatakis, didn't quite like the rawness, had no issues with the ones here as the quality of the beef, along with seasoning and the sauce helped cut the rawness. Foie gras was good too, rich and well seasoned and with the sauce being slightly sweet, the onsen egg helped cut the sweetness, at the same time, binding and harmonizing the different flavours of the dish together beautifully.  Being a huge sashimi fan, I had to go with the En Kaisen Chirashi Don and what a don it was! At a glance, $28 for a chirashi don may seem steep but the chirashi here was an indulgent. It came with 15.....yes... FIFTEEN different piece of sashimi and was served on their speciality pink rice (rice... the rice was pink). I did initially feel that the rice was on the gimmicky side but turns out, it was pretty darn good! The sashimi was fresh and they were very generous with the tobiko, ikura and caviar. This indulging bowl came with: Zawai kani (crab claw), Uni, Caviar, Tobiko, Ikura, Negitoro, Maguro, Salmon, Aburi Salmon, Hotate, Unagi, Anago, Aka Ebi, Hamachi and Tamago Yaki. Monkfish Liver Tofu is something you don't always see and it was delicious! There's a slight hint of the liver taste but the monkfish liver was firm yet very smooth and the ikura and caviar not only added the saltiness to the dish while the uni added a whole new dimension and elevating the flavours of the tofu, offering a rich umami flavour. Zuwai Kani Miso Kourayaki.A very rich and very wholesome dish. Crab meat and guts (it's better than it sounds) grilled in the shell and topped with ikura and a quail egg, the perfect combination of rich, pungent, sweet and salty. For those who enjoy picking the inside of the crab head, this dish is perfect. The richness of the gut complimented the sweetness of the crab beautiful while the ikura offered the saltiness and the quail egg brought the dish together. One of the most unique but delicious dishes I've ever had. Overall the food here is very good. Service though leaves much to be desired. They can be a little slow and often not sure what some of the items on their own menu are but, that aside, this is definitely a must visit place. Service may be average but the food more than makes up for it!"

En Sakaba is located at the 1st floor, taking over MADO Cafe, just right beside Marche.Miso soup is never boring if you order Kani (Crab) Miso Shiru. The usual Soy Bean Paste soup is coupled with little tofu cubes and Queen crab, delighting your taste buds.Kani Miso Shiru - $5If you love Japanese rolled omelette, there is no reason why you won't fall for this! These 4 pieces of rolled omelette were prepared well with yellow consistency in colors and if you draw your eyes nearer to the food, you will see the uniform thickness of its layer, making up this yummy food. What's more, feel the cool temperature of these chilled Tamago, they will never go wrong dabbing with the seaweed sauce. Recommended!Isobe Tamago Yaki - $5 (4 pcs)Another recommended item on the menu that worth your calories would be these grilled braised black pork cheek on the rice served with Onsen egg. Basically, seasonings in the bowl played a good importance here. Food may not be fanciful as it seems, but the harmony of sweet grilled sauce and tender Kurobuta (Black Pork) was perfectKurobuta Niku No Hono Don - $18Initially, I was quite disappointed as we did not order the recommended side, Beef Truffle Carpaccio, Nonetheless, I did also order a recommended Choice of the Foie Gras & Yakiniku. A strong wave of truffle hit me as the bowl was placed on my table. Just can't describe further how it kind of ""lure"" me into them but the egg was runny, cooler than other food items in the bowl. The thinly sliced premium beef was served using tataki method, where the meat were seared over hot flame and marinated well in its seasoning like soy sauce. The initial sight of it may be a turn off for someone who only takes medium well done beef like me but its really worth the try!Foie Gras Yakiniku Onsen Tamago Don - $22Menu is quite limited for its dishes but if you are there for Sake, their sake menu is considered extensive and this place can be a heaven. Anyway, being bored by those mainstream Japanese food in the malls, it was a good visit to En Sakaba, however as of now, I have not seen any noodle dishes on the menu yet."

Just today when we were there for our lunch we realize that Formosa Delights do have a shop space just beside the popular chain Wanton Mee, Fei Fei.I know of Formosa Delights through their outlet in West Coast Plaza for their handmade noodle but unfortunately they had shut down their premises about a year ago and we were quite disappointed to lose a lunch alternative during then.The interior over here looked rather upscale with bars available. Interior was air-conditioned as compared to the neighboring eateries and with a disco kind of ambiance.There was another menu which serves promotional dishes especially for Rush Hour Special apart from the usual menu.Even though we ordered sides, the main courses came first and this portion of Handmade Noodle in Taiwanese Stir Fried Sauce was big even though we had it at discounted rate (usual price $7.90). The bowl was filled with handful of noodle covered by minced meat with mixed vegetables and little toufu cubes as well as shredded cucumbers by the side.Handmade Noodle in Taiwanese Stir Fried Sauce - $6.90Similar to the former dish, Traditional Braised Meat Noodle cost $7.90 at its usual pricing. Ingredients serving of braised meat was unexpectedly huge and on a oily side. However the taste was good with a thoroughly braised hard boiled egg and preserved vegetables.Traditional Braised Meat Noodle - $6.90Since I first known Formosa for its handmade noodle, I'm tempted to have this finest handmade noodle on their menu with a choice of thick or thin noodle. The entire portion was quite big for a pax with 3 prawns, 2 delicious meat balls, mocked abalone pieces, vegetables and mushrooms. The broth of the noodle was definitely a good one, going well with the chinese parsley which elevates the dish. A thoughtful gesture seen was that these parsley was served separately from the dish and diner may choose to add or skip them.Formosa Finest Handmade Noodle - $12.40Though it was not the best  Taiwanese Fried Rice I ever had, the quality was there. Rice grains were relatively short and plum. Eggs and vegetables were the only main ingredients here. Even without the use of meat the dish was fragrant and scrumptious, most importantly, not greasy. Recommended.Vegetarian Fried Rice - $7.90The layers of the crepe was not very even and you can feel as if you are still biting on the dough. Also, there was not much taste of green onion even though hints of green onion can be seen on its top layer.Taiwan Green Onion Crepe  Handmade Dumpling was paired with ginger strips and vinegar. Elongated and with a thin layer of dumpling skin, the fillings were made up of fine minced meat but was not to my liking.Pan Fried Handmade Dumpling - $6.40Don't judge the book by its cover. These little white baos may look unappetizing and boring without its usual pleats and guidelines, the taste of them were simply above an average fare. Trust me.Xiao Long Bao - $5.90The overall menu seems to differ from the Formosa Delights we used to have and had kind of enlightened us. Food that we ordered were generous in portion, however on the greasy side."

Previously before the vegetarian took over, I remembered it was a Cze Char place and till one day it was never there, we still yet to visit the place. However thanks to the Vegetarian colleague who gets hook to the Mala there and thus giving me a chance to visit this place.The place looks modern than I have expected. The place was neatly furnished with round tables and since it is on top of a hill, its rather airy.Besides having Mala Pot, there are other varieties of food available like claypot rice and steam boat.It was my first time having vegetarian Mala, the items displayed may seems ordinary but overall, the Mala Pot depends on the spicy blend we had.Unlike for Yong Tou Foo, for Mala, everything goes by weight. The heavier it gets, the more you have to pay for it. Selection here includes mushroom, black fungus, Tofu, Brocolli , Cauliflower, Button Mushroom, Mock Meat Balls, Crab Meat and others.Interior was pretty simple and plain, without fanciful decorations which kind of illustrate the nature environment.There are a plenty of seating to choose, from inside the shop, to dinning on the wooden planks and the concrete. It was kind of laid back to dine in ""nature"".I'm not very use to dining on top of wooden planks as it is kind of disturbing when someone walks pass with all the squeaking noises produced by the planks. Luckily the place was not too crowded on a week day and there was not much customers sitting closer to our tables.Before having the spicy food, we had prepared ourselves with some icy cooling drinks.Finally our Mala Xiang Guo is ready to served with rice. There is a choice of white or brown rice and the spicy level. Chilli, together with roasted peanuts, pepper corns and coriander enhance the taste. However if you are talking about numbness in the dish, I would say its still within our capacity.The healthier choice of having brown rice. Luckily it was well cooked and hardness was medium without being too grainy.Having the fried mushroom as sides was in fact a very good choice. The batter coated over the mushroom was thin and crispy and the bite into the soft mushroom was heavenly. The taste of these were enhanced by the paprika powder.  Addictive!With the friendly service and variety of food, it is most likely I will be back again for other kinds of vegetarian selection."

My other friends ordered a huge dish of the mala hotpot - basically stir fried sichuan vegetables. For the hotpot, you basically pick out the vegetables you like in a bowl and hand it over to the chef, they will weigh it and stir fry whatever you pick out. The food here was REALLY good, the laksa was very rich in flavor. The mala hotpot was very hot, so make sure you get mild if you cannot handle heat.

The only thing that did not change is the surly service.This place is famous for three main dishes. ""San lao hor fun"" (stir fried rice noodles and fish slices), XO bee hoon (fish slices and rice noodles in soup laced with Cognac), and ""har cheong gai"" (fried chicken with shrimp paste).The soup version of the rice noodle dish comes in a broth that is thick and fragrant, and their version of the fried chicken is rather crunchy and very tasty. (The fried chicken with shrimp paste is a bit of an acquired taste if you have not had it before). It is $1 less if you decide not to have alcohol added to your soup. However, I notice that the soup does not taste as good as before when it was at the old location. I used to be a frequent visitor to the old location at Holland Drive.Price is reasonable, but it's a typical coffeeshop in Singapore which means no AC and brusque service. There's a huge lunch crowd but that means freshly prepared dishes and better food. The number of people there for dinner is significantly less. There's a parking deck behind the coffeeshop, which makes it convenient if you drive. There are plenty of lots on the upper levels.Not as good as it used to be, but still a top choice if you happen to be in the area."

The inclusion of XO into typically milky-to-taste fish beehoon gives a dimension to it and pairs perfectly with the sharpness of ginger in the soup. So good!But what I really like is the Ipoh Fried Hor Fun and Prawn Paste Chicken that you'll find on the tables of everyone having the XO bee hun. The Ipoh Fried Hor Fun is stir-fried with loads of beansprouts, fresh fish slices and soft kway teow (rice noodles). So good and so fragrant. The Prawn Paste Chicken is a pretty acquired thing for some because of the ""Hei Bi"" (dried prawn) taste. Acquired in the way much like Smelly Tofu is acquired. The version here is good, I like that it is not artificially red and has the aroma of the dried prawn in every crispy bite."

I like how the fish is so fresh and nice, and the soup is sweet and rich in flavor (from both the milk and the xo). The wait can be a little long when it gets crowded, but trust me it's really going to be worth the wait because you would want your food to be served hot! Other than their xo fish slice bee hoon, their sum lo hor fun and prawn paste chicken is also worth a try. Last but no least just a tip, it is more value for money if you order individual bowls instead of a big bowl for sharing (because there's more soup and more fish slice!)."

I was amazed at the quality of the food.What we ordered:1. Ayam Tempra - Not bad but the portion is a tad small. Chicken is succulent and tasty.2. Bakwan Kepiting - Meatballs are soft and soup is tasty. Not enough for 6 adults unless you cut the meatballs in half and share.3. Sayur Lodeh - My favourite dish of all. Standard was up to par.4. Babi Pongteh - Portion is the smallest of all with about 5 big pieces of meat and we had to share. However, the gravy is delicious enough to make up for the lack in portion.5. Udang Assam Goreng - I didn't try this dish as I do not eat seafood but my dinner companions said it was good so I'll take their word for it.6. Honey Pork - Very minute pieces of fried pork in very dark sauce that looks black. Doesn't look appealing but it fared 'ok' in taste.7. Fuyong Egg - The usual egg, scrambled and fried with bean sprouts and peas. Nothing can go wrong here.8. Sayur Lemak - Vegetables were not soft enough, coconut gravy was too diluted and the sweet potatoes gave the appearance of being too hard on first prod with a fork but was soft enough to chew.9. Hee Piow Soup - Soup was delicious and fish balls were soft. Will order this again.10. Nasi Kuning x 6 - Very fragrant rice!11. Dessert: Chendol, Gula Melaka Sago - Skip the dessert if you can as there is nothing to shout about. Very small portion. Chendol was too sweet while the Gula Melaka Sago has too much ice. Wanted to order Bubur Trigur but it was sold out. Since it was sold out, it probably means that it's good!Nothing to complain except that the portion is small and is a good trait of theirs if you'd like to order more dishes to taste and share. Price-wise, it cost an average of S$4++ per dish.In total, we paid S$63 for 6 adults and 1 child and is considered quite affordable!Will dine here again but probably at the Heartland Mall branch. If you are dining at the Bukit Timah branch, suggest to make a reservation beforehand as it gets pretty packed, especially on weekends and on public holidays.p.s.

I've never been properly introduced to peranakan food until I have been to Ivins, because the low prices make it absolutely possible to order more than what I usually would. I especially love the beef rendang- the beef is melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the sauce is not too thick but packed with all the spices, and the portion is just right so you dont feel too gelat after just one dish. The egg omelette is also pretty popular especially with my two nephews, and its not hard to see why. Not only is the egg fluffy, they are also extremely generous with the ingredients (chai po etc). Another classic would be the honey pork, which consists of small thin chunks of pork carefully marinated with honey and cooked in dark sauce (even though I've always been puzzle why they serve it with boiled green peas because no one seems to eat them!). On days when I crave for something light, I always go for the chicken macaroni which is simply macaroni cooked in clear soup. I also have a super sweet tooth, so I never give the desserts a miss no matter how full I am for lunch. My favourite has to be the bo bo cha cha- the yam is cooked to perfection (crumbles when eaten but firm upon serving), the starchy balls give great texture to dish, and the milk is light and creamy. Their tau suan is also especially well done, not too sweet with just the right amount of starch. A caveat is that the place is not especially well ventilated, so for the office workers who want to avoid smelling like food for the rest of the day, it would be best to visit for dinner."

A must-try is the ayam buah keluak - a dish that is so damn good with rice but an absolute nightmare to cook. If you don't know why, go google the recipe. Other than that, the sambal that comes with the lady's finger dish is extremely tasty without being overly spicy. One last dish that you should order is the sotong/fish hitam - chopped onions along with sliced green and red chilli are lightly fried in delicious dark sauce before being slathered on seafood.

Very good food especially for the prices and the amount of work one would have to put in if cooking even one of those dishes at home. I highly recommend it! Might be a bit hard to find parking so either go early or very late."

Although predominantly Peranakan, the food is similar to what we eat at home on a daily basis. Best of all, this home style restaurant is reasonably priced hence the immense crowd as well. Local favorites include Fish Head Curry, Sweet Pork with Peas, Mince Meatball soup , Sambal Kangkong and many more. I can't pick personal favorites here as every individual dish is wonderful so I recommend going in a group of 3 or more so you can share an array of dishes and truly experience the exciting flavours Peranakan cuisine has to offer. Despite the crowd, food does come quick which is a huge plus!"

Apparently this is one of the outlets of this chain. This is my first time eating here so here's my review:Food:My friends and I ordered the hot plate brinjal, herbal mushroom and ""three cups tofu"". I usually hear of ""three cups chicken"" (三杯鸡) but never heard of tofu, hence that piqued my interest. Food arrived quite quickly, and the dishes were surprisingly good. The hot plate brinjal came wrapped in aluminium foil, the herbal mushroom came as a soup and the tofu came as stir fried (you can see my picture). They were flavourful, and pretty well cooked. The brinjal wasn't cooked too much till it's pulpy, and the tofu still had a spring to it. However, the tofu isn't the standard tofu u get on the market - it's some processed tofu with extra ingredients inside (I wanted to see how the plain tofu could be cooked with 三杯). In addition, I think we were having a relatively drier batch of rice (lucky there was soup and gravy from the food) The soup was actually relatively thick compared to most soups outside, however some of the herbs were evidently not boiled long enough (it's one of the roots, I forgot what it's called). Oh, and I ordered the homemade barley drink, and it's good! Thick and good. You should really try it. Ambience:Tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood in Jurong West, this shop is surprisingly accessible to the bus stop (that's if you know how to walk there). Just cross 1, 2 blocks and you've reached either place - and buses 99 (to Clementi) and 187 (to Woodlands) both reach the place. I went on a Wednesday night and the place was still relatively crowded, definitely showing how popular this place is. Nevertheless, we reached at about 7pm and could still comfortably get seats for 4 of us. There's a slightly hipster feel, and the place seems to be run by young people. Definitely a decent place yo chitchat after a day at work (provided you ain't exhausted from work) Overall rating:Food was decent, though I wouldn't say very impressive. Place is good and conducive to eat and talk at. Pricing can reach more than $10 (but below $20) per person to be decently full. I would definitely come again to try the other menu items, and then I'll reflect my review accordingly."

The one thing that I really like about fish and co is that the quality is very consistent; I don't recall having a single bad plate of fish and chips ever. The servings are always big and the fries are always crispy and satisfying.

We felt that the fish was too oily and just didn't taste that good at all. The prawns were also not very fresh because I could feel the ""bite"" that fresh prawns had. Lastly, we found that the fries were somewhat soggy as well.We also had pasta, but it just wasn't anywhere near satisfying.

The sauce didn't quite taste right, though it was on the way to the right destination. The blue cheese dressing also wasn't watered down, which was nice. However there was too much batter on the wings, so the texture of the skin was off.The Italian Four Cheese wings also suffered from too much batter, as you might expect given that they probably started out done the same way. The cheese on top was nice but rather uneven - one piece had a lot more cheese than the others. And though it was Four Cheese wings I could only detect Mozzarella.The German BBQ Pork Rib Croissant was mediocre. The croissant was stale and not buttery; its pseudo flakiness was the sort of flaking you get when you toast a stale croissant. And the wedges were rather overcooked, with one of the smaller pieces being impenetrable (at least to our forks).As for the cod charcoal fish and chips, while the batter was not too thick it was very hard. I'm not sure if that was due to the charcoal or the over frying, but from the other dishes, probably the latter. Meanwhile the fish was on the soft side and fell apart easily. This was one of the least firm cod dishes I've had. And the fries were definitely overcooked - much more so than the wedges.The iced lemon tea was quite normal, but they had Avengers-themed milkshakes. The Hulk (Green tea) milkshake was so-so. It wasn't that thick and was not evenly blended, with a few ice cubes that were quite large. The green tea taste wasn't very strong either. They get props for originality though - the milkshake had a marshmallow and 2 green tea rolls inside, and the plate it was served on was dusted with green tea powder. And the other milkshakes were Oreo, caramel latte and chocolate, which is different from the usual vanilla, chocolate and strawberry.While the food here is rather creatively conceived, things really fall apart in the execution."

There was more fats than meat, while the miserable portion of the rice was just so-so. For the price I paid, I didn't feel it was worth it. You have options to add on if you want and I chose to add on a soup and drink. The mushroom soup (soup of the day) was ok. Overall, I felt underwhelmed by my experience.

I recommend spending some time standing by the pickup counter, unobtrusively observing this master artisan at work.   One after another the orders stream in, pegged to take cardboard takeout containers or melamine serviceware and methodically and in a trance-like state, his hands are a continuous blur of industry.  There are no fancy sautee pans or copper-bottomed kettles or pots, only the wok and the long-handled bowl ladle that are in constant motion, a mesmerizing tango that produces dish after dish of steaming heavenly goodness.  Ingredients are almost carelessly tossed into a glowing wok to sauté airily once, twice and finish with a pirouette into a waiting bowl.  Few spectacles are quite as beautiful or as full of mastery as this fiery dance, a steaming chanson, a culinary ode to Singapore institution.I recommend the house special, the sam loh hor fun which is wok fried flat rice noodles (kway teow), thinly-sliced fish and bean sprouts bathed in a deceptively subtle sauce with some real depth, boasting a coy umami swaddled in the rich smokiness of scorched rice noodle.  Try to resist the urge to add soy or other condiment to this dish.  Luxuriate in the aroma and just let your eyes roll back into your head while your senses try in vain to capture each enticingly elusive scent in the cacophony of sensory signals rapidly flooding your brain.  Savor the sauce before exploring what fresh-cut mouse chilies or light soy might do change the tempo of the experience.Other honorable mentions:  the yang chow fried rice, smoky grains of glistening jasmine rice with egg, pork, scallions and shrimp..just gorgeous, and the fish meat noodle soup which is a bowl of near-perfect harmony of creamy, umami, spicy and interesting textures.  As is the custom for me now, I end this review with an earnest admonition to go out and try HK Street Chun Tat Kee for yourself.  I've never been much of a voyeur and neither should you.  Life is too short and too full of unexpected epiphanies for you to be reading about this rather than experiencing it for yourself!"

However... like most XO Fish Head Bee Hoon places who received rave reviews, they too are on a downward spiral and judging by what we had last night? A very quick spiral.Maybe once I get try the fish head Bee Hoon, my impression of this place might change, but for this review, I'm concentrating on the Tze Char that we had ordered. Baby KailanI love Baby Kailan. As long as it's not cooked to death, I'm usually not too fussy with the dish. The initial impression was great! Bright green, it showed that the Kailan's were well cooked, however, one taste and all that happiness went out the window. Completely tasteless, the dish barely tasted of anything. Clearly the dish had a sauce but it tasted like starchy water. Even the taste of garlic was absent. Hotplate VenisonProbably the only dish we had that decent, except for the fact that the Sizzling Hot Plate... wasn't sizzling. Venison itself was properly cooked and the sauce was tasty but there wasn't really an oomph about it. Cereal PrawnsI'm at a complete lost for words... And not in a good way. There was minimal Cereal. Cereal was soaked in oil and resembled wet sand. The portion had shrunk drastically and the price had been jacked up ($16 for 6 prawns). Although the flavour was decent... The oil made it feel like a heart attack on a plate. It was disappointing that their standards had dropped so drastically, especially since they raised prices ($18 for venison, $16 for prawn and $7 for kailan) . The saving grace of our dinner? Brother (兄弟) Rojak. But that's another review for another day.  Although not the worst Tze Char, it certainly missed the mark in terms of tze char satisfaction."

I tried all the mayos and they're not bad - yuzu is my least favorite as I expected.

You can choose to order outside the shop using their iPads on their walls or order inside with the staff. You pay and they will give you a beeping device when your food is ready. You look for seats and get your dipping sauce and water. Collect food at the counter and enjoy your meal. They have limited seating so it's more like a eat-and-scoot-off place.

I guess with the flurry of small cafes, bakeries, patisseries sprouting up in recent months (or is it years already?), it is hard to keep track. After a while, they really do seem to serve the same old stuff, taste about the same, cost also about the same, that most are pretty forgettable. I may like a pretty thing but what will leave an indelible impression will be the taste. Taste over appearance for me. The first impression of Carpenter and Cook is the darkness and seemingly messiness. It is not really messy, but it has a lot of things (antique or old stuff) crammed into the shop. And many wooden furniture inside also makes the place look darker than it actually is. I do quite like the vibe. Almost indie to me. Everything sort of work together even though everything is so mis-matched. That adds to the charm. You just share a big table if there are no smaller tables available. Quite nice actually. Everyone talks in a normal/soft tone so it is just a low hum of conversation, nothing jarring to the ears. And so you won't be an unwilling eavesdropper at all, even if you are sharing a table with strangers. After checking reviews on what was the recommended food (i.e. passionfruit meringue tart and lemon cream tart - isn't that wonderful of having a smartphone and internet and google and yelp and blogs?), I went to place my order. While there, I was very taken with the lemon meringue cake and the banoffee tart. They looked very tempting. I decided to just try the lemon meringue cake. It is quite rare to find a meringue cake and even rarer to find one which does it well. I love the lemon meringue cake which has 2 layers of sponge cake with a thin layer of  lemon curd and topped with meringue all around. The cake was moist and you could really taste the freshness of it. No day-old cake at all. The tartness of the lemon made a perfect foil against the slight sweetness of the cake and the sweeter meringue which was also very nicely done.  I liked that the meringue was not the typical hard type when served on its own but was a bit foamy soft and yet could stand on its own. You could just taste the egg white and sugar whipped until stiff and then browned a little in the heat. The sea salt chocolate caramel tart was nice but nothing memorable. For a chocolate lover, it is saying a lot when I actually prefer the tart instead of the sweet.P.S. I like the placement of lemons scattered all over the place. It does create a pop of color and cheer in the brownness of the place."

Although the lettuce seemed fresher, it really looked like all they did was top up and left the bottom as it was, soaking in whatever dressing was there and turning into a dead mush in the process.

First off, the positives: the ladies at the counter were friendly, the decor of the place gives a feel of something found if Old-school and Indie got married. I'm a bit biased when it comes to arty decor and the ambience of this place just hit it off with me so very well. Now, the not-so-good stuff: Despite all the praises sung about the pastries, I honestly felt I could find much better alternatives elsewhere. I found the lemon meringue to be average at best, and the sea salt choc tart... well... something I'd try once and only once. And now where I get really picky: I've tried Liberty coffee - and while I immensely enjoyed the latter, I found the coffee at C&C to be rather weak. So.... I'd have to say I differ in my opinion from what seems to be everybody else when I say that the coffee was rather disappointing. All in all, though I really loved the design of the place, I don't think I'd come back. The food was decent, but nothing particularly noteworthy for me; and if you're as picky about coffee as I am, you'd know there are plenty of other places to go to get a good dose."

Marcus' story about the place below sounds amazing so I'm looking forward to partake in the ""cook"" part of this cafe.I know of a friend holding an engagement party at this very spot!All in all, I'll give a go for the atmosphere alone - non-pretentious and pretty private amongst your seating space. The servers are polite and helpful without being too intrusive, something which I always appreciate. Will be back to try more of the food and review this spot again!"

It'll be a place where friends will share secrets over a pot of tea, where lovers reunite, where lost treasures are found. But dreams will remain as dreams unless you have the courage to pursue it. So they did. And Carpenter and Cook was born. The shop is exactly out of a fairy tale. The nostalgia and charm of a time lost and then rediscovered. The interior is warmy and cosy, peppered with an eclectic mix of handpicked and restored furniture. There is just this air of positivity and hope. I guess it must have come from Phoebe, Shenn and Eunice, who obviously have put in their heart and soul into the place. There is something romantic about old furniture. Who did it belong to? What was the owner like? Why did they buy it? Who was it for? Each piece comes with a history that we may never know about; each a mystery.I pondered these over the freshly baked tarts (S$6.20) and a cup of mocha. The bakes are as dreamy as everything else. These are made by the Cordon Bleu trained hands of Shenn and each bite was as delicious as you can imagine. For me, my search for the best tart ends here. The crisp and buttery tart base is everything one would look for. It doesn't fall to pieces when you cut or bite into it. Neither is it too soft that it fails to hold the filling. The Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel tart was a bitter sweet delight. I like that it isn't too cloyingly sweet. A hint of sea salt gives way to a smokey caramel and then you hit the bitter notes of the chocolate in the aftertaste. There is a clear separation of the chocolate and the tart but it melts from the warmth of your lips and becomes a rich elixir that goes down easily. The Lemon Cream tart was a custard and eggy delight. It's a little sharp but that's it's character. I guess a person's taste preference is also an indication of what they are like. Obviously i'm not the sweet and docile girl. I declare this to be the best tart in Singapore. It can't get better than this."

As we waited in line for a seat, the couple next to us used a vintage display cabinet as a tabletop for filling in a form to have their pre-wedding shoot held here.As with all wildly popular eateries, there's always a presumption that service will be brusque and impersonal. I'm happy to report that the servers we encountered at Carpenter & Cook were welcoming and chirpy. Furnished with rustic pieces acquired by one of its three co-owners from all over the world, the cafe exuded a homely and laid-back vibe in spite of the teatime crowd. Communal seating is practised here, which is fine by me since I've recently been trained not to attack openly affectionate couples.Lavender Bundt Cake, $4.00 - Whilst surveying the pastries on display, we were a little taken aback by how steep the prices were. It took just four bites to finish this palm-sized bundt cake (we're talking preschooler hands here), which tasted quite uninspiring. It was my first encounter with lavender in cake form, though apart from some notes of cinnamon I frankly couldn't detect anything else in the cake. I also felt the honey glaze was superfluous since it added neither depth of flavor nor moisture to the cake, which was a little too dry.Passionfruit Meringue Tart, $6.50 - Highly raved about in almost every review of Carpenter & Cook I've read, this tart had a crisp, buttery shell that broke off easily when you cut into it with a fork. The beautifully seared meringue peaks had a texture akin to toasted marshmallow innards... that's actually meant to be much more delicious than it reads. Found the passionfruit curd way too sweet, but supporters swear by it so if too much sugar's your thing, go right ahead and order this.Smashing Savoury Brioche Bun (Veg.), $6.50 - A sprinkle of sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, olives and a couple sprigs of parsley on a fluffy brioche bun. I have to say the bun was moist, soft and wonderfully herby, but for six friggin' fifty? I wouldn't have ordered this if I were allowed to have things my own tyrannical way.Triple chocolate chip muffin, $3.50 - This was a flat out disaster. The muffin was so dry that every poke of the fork triggered an avalanche of crumbs. Also, the chocolate used was sickeningly sweet and of exceedingly poor quality - I say this as someone who has no qualms about eating Van Houten chocolates by the boxful.Flat White, $5.00 - Like any Singaporean cafe worth their salt, Carpenter & Cook utilises the Speakeasy blend from Liberty Coffee. Sadly, premium beans alone do not a good cup of coffee make. My flat white was served lukewarm, left a slightly acrid aftertaste, and came with zero art boohoohoo. Maybe it was because the cafe was crowded when we visited, but they could definitely pay a little more attention to detail for drink prep.By the end of our visit we were left scratching our heads about the hype surrounding Carpenter & Cook. It's obvious that they have the leisurely come-burn-your-weekend-afternoon-with-us ambiance bit down pat, but food and price wise there's so much room for improvement you could fit Mariah Carey and her entourage in there. I'd like to think that we visited on an off-day. I guess I wouldn't mind coming back if I happen to be in the area, though it'll be an uphill task convincing me to go out of my way to visit Carpenter & Cook a second time."

I'll definitely be back here again (although I live sooo far away). That's how much I've fallen in love with the place. Thanks for taking the time to chat with us and explain the lovely selection of food. The Food  1) Quiche  (ham and mushroom) -  It was amazing!!! The texture was smooth & practically melt-in-your-mouth.  The crust was baked to perfection! It's no surprise to learn that the cook trained in the prestigious Cordon Bleu in London. This is indeed no ordinary Quiche2) Passionfruit Meringue Tart - Another must try item!!! It's just heaven!!! omg!!! I've never been a huge fan of tarts but this one was AMAZING. It took all my will power to not gobble up the whole piece and leave some for Kah Hong to try. I think I managed to leave like 1/4 (at least I tried)... haha... he loved it too!!!  The passionfruit filling was creamy, thick and not-too-sweet. While the crust was crispy and baked to perfection just like the Quiche. 3) Drinks - I love the Elderflower soda (makes me think of LOTR for some reason. food for the elves. I am sure they would approve). The Ginger beer was a tad bit too strong for me but Kah seems to be ok with it. He's the adventurous foodie. Anyways, what a unique selection of sodas they have! Seriously, I don't think I've seen them anywhere else in Singapore. The AmbianceBeautiful! Vintage furnitures that has a nostalgic old world, British cafe feel to it :)Tip: Heard it gets pretty crowded on weekends so go early! or on weekdays nights (perfect chill out place after a long day of work)."

All of it was picked up as a hobby while she used to live in London, when it hit her that she should ship all of it back home. Lucky us, eh? I've seen seriously cool stuff, including a couple of rotary phones - they even use one for the shop phone.Shenn is the ""cook"", and she makes all the bakes... and this includes the brioche they use for their sandwiches, and the tart shells in their ridiculously awesome passionfruit meringue tarts, and even the killer passionfruit marshmallows. Yes, she makes marshmallows. Oh, and she makes jams too. Just sayin'.Eunice is the ""and"", and boy does she tie everything together. She runs the cafe front, and if that isn't enough, she also offers food styling and dessert table services.

Told her it was my first time and she cheerfully recommended a few items, 2 of which I got: lemon tart and bacon quiche. Atmosphere was buzzing, full house but I managed to get a seat.  It's an amazing throw back to the 20's, ragtime music, sewing tables and old school advertising. Felt like I was on an episode of The Pickers: everything is for sale. The bad: Quiche was served cold and the so called best lemon tart in Singapore was good but not mind blowing. The custard was spot on, but the crust was too thin and hard. Was also served my latter in a glass...WHY?  This isn't the only spot that is guilty of this, but I can't for the life of me figure out why places do this. You should never put hot water in glass. First of all once the heat from the water will go to the surface of the glass causing the glass to absorb heat, making it fire hot.  Secondly, after the glass gets scorching hot, the water gives up heat into the air, reducing the temperature of the water (drink gets cold quick = bad).  Because of this, your drink goes from scorching hot to ice cold faster than you can say Carpenter + Cook, and unfortunately there isn't enough time to drink it in between.  People don't just use mugs for the cute handles, it serves a purpose.  The ugly: Carpenter has his stuff together but Cook needs to step up their game just a bit and really wow with the food. That's the difference between 3, 4 and 5 stars: the wow factor.  Although I enjoyed 20+ minutes of old timer songs, I don't think I could handle much more. I don't know how those employees do it...but perhaps that's what makes them so smiley...they've gone insane from the tunes."

I am no cafe spotter, but as a fourth year (and very restless) undergraduate with too much time on my hands, the easy excuse of ""coffee hunting"" has brought me to coffee haunts in all corners of Singapore. Now that with one just minutes from my house- there was simply no excuse to not go.I decided to check out the place with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. Being familiar with the area we did not have any trouble locating the place, but I can imagine how the unassuming shopfront (very dark tinted windows) might be easily missed by first-timers, especially since the cafe is modestly nestled among rows of tuition centres. Even then, any trouble would be well worth your while the moment you step in- the place is warmly lit, the air is cool and well ventilated (I have a thing about smelling like the food I just ate). The decor of the place was lovely (lovely china and well-done vintage without a hint of gaudiness). Many of the ornaments and furniture are for sale, hence the ""Carpenter"" in ""Carpenter & Cook"".The food looks absolutely delicious - tarts, pastries, cakes, coffee/teas (there isn't really any savoury food). I would have ordered every pastry available just from the way they looked- but having come from a heavy lunch, we eventually compromised on a lemon tart, a long black and an iced latte. The lemon tart definitely convinced me to make a return visit. It is is possibly my favorite lemon tart right now! It was simple- exactly how I wished it was- a sturdy pastry (perhaps a bit too hard for some) filled with a really smooth lemon curd. I won't go so far as to say it completely blew my mind- but if you've ever had a great pastry that made your toes curl, you'd totally get it. The coffee also did not disappoint- even my friend who is very much of a coffee snob remarked that it was 'not too bad at all'."

The stall is bustling with activity, several aunties cooking, filling up the small plates of soy-chilli sauce and washing dishes.I asked for the standard, claypot bak kut teh for one. A minute later, there was a pot full of boiling, fragrant broth in front of me. I immediately understood why the advocates of herbal bak kut teh scoff at the teochew version. Suddenly, it seemed to me all those bowls of peppery bak kut teh I'd had were one-dimensional and dull. This, in contrast, was just fantastic, a cauldron full of a massive variety of intertwined flavours. The ribs were soft and tender, with meat falling off the bone, and the addition of mushrooms and lettuce lifted the whole thing to another level. I finished my bowl and felt fully satisfied, but wanting badly to have more.Truly amazing bak kut teh. Definitely worth the trip."

The soup is just thick enough and thoroughly infused with all sorts of fragrant Chinese herbs; together with the fried dough fritters (you tiao), the experience is just heavenly. The pork ribs were extremely tender and fall off the bone very easily, and they tasted perfect when dipped in the dark sauce with chili.

There are many plus points to it. Other than having Japanese ramen style meepok with shoyu and char su (char siew jap style), you get their relentless precision and hardwork. When they set up a mee pok stall, they mean serious business. The noodles are real al' dente and I usually order extra serving just to slurp more on its own! $0.50 only.

While starting at the back, it seemed that there was a large order to go, which I understand, family breakfast, gathering, it's fine. When I finally got to move a step, it was 30 minutes later. Ok my expectation was growing as I got hungrier. Another 30 minutes passed and my order was taken in advance. I ordered the special noodle no.1 and added noodles for 50 cents more. Ok, another 20 minutes wait and I got my food.The noodle portion was generous, a pretty hearty amount. It came with a prawn, 3 pieces of abalone, and minced meat, all glaced with lard. One of the main characteristic of the noodles is that it has a lot of lard (crispy not soft) which is good I guess, to prevent the noodles from sticking together. However, I reckon the crowd caused Naoji san to undercook the noodles and it was slightly hard still. I must say that the overall taste was very balanced, a tinge of vinegar, soy sauce, except for the lard part, very overwhelming. So somehow it was not overly tasty, but the chilli sauce helped a fair bit.I also ordered a bowl of teochew dumpling soup, there was a lot of lard in the soup as well. Again, I had the same observation, the dumplings were not cooked enough, the skin of the dumpling was slightly undercooked with the pork filling.Would have preferred to give a 3.5 stars but I guess it's not available yet. Given the hype, I will go to the original Ah Hoe mee pok, lesser queue and more flavorful mee pok."

It's a wetter bak chor mee, doused in a flavorful broth. Both times I admit the overall flavor profile is better than most bak chor mee I've had, probably enhanced by the addition of the abalone and prawn juice broth at the bottom of the noodles. Unfortunately that also makes the noodles soggy quickly which negates the initially al dente crunchy texture :( The meatballs are tasty but the meat slices and prawns were underwhelming. I don't think it's worth the wait, order online and do pickup, it's only 50 cents more for a 40 minute saving in time. They do delivery too but I'm unsure of the delivery radius. -- This was even though there seemed like only 4 parties ahead of us?

In a local dish. It's official... As much as I loved our Michelin starred Teochew Mince Pork noodle, I have officially found my current favorite Bak Chor Mee (Minced Pork Noodles). I won't go into the backstory of how the stall was first open by her father etc as googling Ah Hoe Mee Pok will prompt multiple sites sharing their family's story.  Instead, I'll dive straight into the dishes we tried. Special Mee Pok - Soup or Dry ($4 / $5)Let's start with the ""basic"" or one of the starter Mee Poks. Ordered the non-chilli version as the wife is not much a Chilli eater. I really hate to say this but.... Based on the non-chilli version, the Mee Pok here is a lot better than our Michelin Star version. The noodles used for both the Mee Pok and Mee Kia were of very good quality, retaining its springiness and chewiness. It absorbed the flavors of their sauce very well and didn't have that floury starchy taste that is commonly found in other Mee Pok dishes. For $5, there is a generous amount of ingredients , with 2 prawns, 3 slices of abalone (mock? Or lower grade abalones), 2 meat balls and a lot of minced pork. The sauce used was really delicious. It was fragrant, salty, a little sweet and rich, thanks to the oil from the fried lard but it wasn't overly oily, allowing the sauce to coat the Mee Pok beautifully without leaving that thick oily feeling on the roof of your mouth. Japanese Fusion - miso / shoyu - soup or dry ($6 / $7) We had to try what made this place famous. The Japanese fusion noodles. I went with $6 for the shoyu and $7 for the miso. Both served dry. What made both these dishes so great was the sauce and the way it coated the noodles. This wasn't just some mad experiment to add ingredients into a minced meat noodles. With the first bite, you can taste the effort and the though process of putting everything together. The sauces both coated to noodles beautifully, ensuring that you get the fusion flavors popping in your mouth with every bite, without overpowering your taste buds. It almost reminds you of a good Tsukemen Ramen where instead of a broth, you get a thick, rich, dipping sauce for your noodles. The Miso version offered a very earthy flavor. Very umami with the natural sweetness of the miso coming through delicately. It was very wholesome yet light enough to ensure that you don't get tired of the flavors after the first 2-3 bites. The Shoyu version was surprisingly the bolder version. Unlike our regular soya sauce, Shoyu is made with fermenting more wheat than soya beans. It's less salty but richer and more wholesome and this made a world of difference to the dish. It was fragrant, full of flavor and there was a hint of either Nori or Bonito that had been infused with the shoyu, giving it a sweet, fragrant, slightly more umami flavor that you normally get with regular Chinese soya sauce. And like the ""regular"" Mee Pok, they are very generous with the ingredients. For $7, which may seem steep for a bowl of minced pork noodles, you get 2 slices of abalone, 4 meat balls, lots of minced pork, lean pork slices and 2 large pieces of Japanese chashu, which almost melts in your mouth with each bite. What I really like across the board is the care that was put into each ingredient. Unlike most minced pork noodles, the lean and minced pork were perfectly cooked, tender and almost bouncy with the minced pork having a food fat to meat ratio, ensuring that it doesn't go dry while cooking. Even when preparing each dish, the cook doesn't just boil everything and dump it into the bowl. Each ingredient is ""plated"" carefully, showing off the typical Japanese pride when it comes to cooking. Teochew Dumpling soup While the dumplings (wantons) were pretty normal and the soup (to me) a little on the salty side, they were again very generous with their ingredients. No plain soup with dumplings here. The soup was nice and chalky from the cooking of the pork and there was minced pork and lots of cabbage in the soup. A great way to balance and otherwise very meaty lunch. Overall, I really enjoyed the noodles here. For the traditionalist, it may be a step too far away from an authentic bowl of teochew minced meat noodles but from a consumer / foodie stand point, it certainly was special and offered something so familiar yet so different, showing that sometimes, maybe drifting slightly away from tradition may just help take what is deemed as common hawker food, to the next level. After all, with Japanese / Asian influences making its appearance is michelin star restaurants across the globe, it's only a matter of time that our local hawker favorites receive the same treatment. There is certainly no confusion in this Japanese Chinese Fusion. Remarks: Do take note that because he doesn't dump all the ingredients in to cook at once and because each bowl is cooked individually and with care, waiting time may take longer jan the average Mee Pok seller."

I remember the Punggol Nasi Lemak being just marginally better due to the rice. But have to say it worth a try."

I ordered the fish set (at $2.50), which came with 2 fish, egg and the usual ikan bilis. Oh man, the fish was deep fried until it was absolutely crunchy; I basically ate the whole fish, flesh and bones included! The rice is yet another aspect that stands out; it was moist and fluffy. The rice is actually good enough to be eaten on its own! With the sambal chili, the rice just tastes absolutely amazing.My friend ordered the chicken set, which came with a chicken wing and egg. He remarked that the chicken wing was really tasty as well. Perhaps I'll try the chicken set on my next visit, but the queue really scares me off sometimes."

The corner stall often has a queue that spills out towards the car park entrance. Business is brisk and chicken wings are constantly being thrown into hot oil to replenish the ones that have been sold.The rice is especially flavourful and tasty. The fragrance of the coconut milk does not overpower a hint of pandan leaf and the rice must be savoured with the chili sauce. The turmeric-marinated chicken wings are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. You can also choose from other items like chicken nuggets, fish fillets, eggs and chicken franks. The stall front is plastered with newspaper articles recommending the stall. I personally attest to the stall as a great supper choice if you are in the area and it is also popular among NTU students. The food isn't as great during the dinner shift, I have no clue why but it's true. Come between midnight and 3am, when the stall closes."

I always do write that food stalls in Singapore survive based on their chili sauce. This is especially true for BLPNL with it's spicy chili sauce. While many might find that the ""nasi"" (rice) offered by BLPNL might not have sufficient fragrance and clumpy at times, BLPNL makes up for it with it's fried chicken wings and chili sauce. A standard serving at $3.00 comes with egg, ikan bilis, one chicken wing, rice, chili and a slice or two of cucumber. One can pick additional fried food such a sausages, chicken nuggets, etc. at extra a la carte prices. The star of the show is definitely the crispy chicken wing and spicy chili sauce and is a must-try.Parking might be difficult at night as HDB carparks are nearly fully occupied at night. However, that has never set Singaporeans back from coming to Boon Lay for supper. The queue has always been especially long at this stall but service is relatively fast. Supper-goers, do take note that they open till 2am only."

But yet, the queue at this stall is quite long at any point of time. I'm quite puzzled as to why it is so, but nevertheless, I'm not going to eat at this stall if I can.While it is cheap ($2.50), the chicken is bland, the charsiew is tasteless and the rice is clumpy at times. The sauce is just normal dark sauce. The vegetables are cooked in batches and draped in oil. The vegetables serving are also of a random portion. The aunty would sometimes grab more, sometimes grab less. The service is not that fast either. Of course, by absolute measurement, it is fast, but compared to other chicken stalls outside, the preparation and cutting of meat is slower as compared to other stalls. One thing to note is that they will serve white rice once their chicken rice runs out and when that happens (I was once in that situation), I would advise you to just refuse politely and have your meal at another stall. The white rice and chicken combination was ok to fill your belly but not that nice for an enjoyable meal."

The Sicilian boat pizza was something I'd never seen before and enjoyed! I did love my pasta though, I didn't want to share it... And it's a little hard to because it wasn't an enormous portion.

Galbiati is, in my opinion, that neighborhood deli where you'd go for a cuppa, that reliable and delicious pizza/pasta and chow it down with a good glass of wine. This isn't a place where the chef is looking to dazzle you with fancy plating, small portions and the accompanying high prices. No sireee. What you can count on are fresh, classic Italian dishes done excellently and at a very affordable price point. The fact that I live a short drive away just makes this place such a keeper! I treated my family to dinner last Sunday and had a table of 8. We ordered soups, the antipasti misto, salads, calamari, risotto, pastas and lamb shank. The standouts for us were the calamari (fried crisp, not oily, accompanied with a good tomato dip), my squid ink fettucine with fresh crab meat (oh lawwwdeee the pasta was cooked perfectly, the crab meat chunks were real off the claw stuff, not canned...and the sauce!!), and the literally, fall-off-the-bone tender lanb shank. Guys, you want to know what a good braised lamb shank should taste like? Come here. I thought the appetizers were par for the course as were the salads, and although the risotto is supposed to be the chef's specialty, I thought it could've been a little smoother and we felt quite carbed out finishing the plate. The wine selection is obviously skewed towards Italy and I thought our pick was fine, though nothing mind blowing like a Guildalberto you could buy at a similar price point off wholesale. Not much character to it and mild enough to accompany the variety of dishes on our table. Desserts were well-liked all round and we had practically everything on the menu. I must mention that the service was great throughout our meal. Our waiter kept checking on us and ensured our glasses were filled. Each course was served to everyone at almost the same time (not an easy feat with a full house) and one of the waiters helped to carry my grandma's wheelchair when we were getting her to the car. In all, a great meal and we'll be back, definitely to try brunch. There are easily a dozen restaurants down Bukit Timah but besides Pepp, most are skewed towards high end ""casual"" or fine dining and that means a once or twice a year visit . Places like Galbiati fill a good niche where one gets affordable, high quality Italian that's convenient and friendly. Now all we need are those Vespas..."

The spicy salami was actually just salami with spicy peppers sprinkled around, and boy were they spicy.. My mouth was on fire after having bitten into one, leaving me wanting ice cream. The mushrooms were something akin to shimeji mushrooms, interestingly. Not quite what I expected, but nice and juicy. The tomato sauce had a bit of a canned taste, but I think (or hope so, anyway) that it was freshly made. Nice thin crispy crust! $16.80, pretty affordable.I just found it rather curious that the appetizers were mostly priced around $14, and the pastas were around $18-$20.

Not much of wow factor but is better than those frozen ones from the supermarket.Margharita- $16.80I enjoyed its crispy edges and luckily its a sharing dish, thus each of us gets to eat 1-2 pieces only.Given the choice of pasta either fettuccine or Angel's hair for our Live Calms, I had chosen the latter.The style of pasta was in the soup form rather than just dry pasta with calms. It was kind of unique to me as not everywhere do sell them in soup based. They were generous with live calms and as Angel's hair pasta is quite thin, I felt that the entire meal was like having ""La La"" in Chinese Thin Noodles. The soup was appetizing with sliced garlic, tarragon and white wine. With the use of bird eye chili, it gave a little spice to the dish.White Wine (Clams) - $18.80US choice beef patty, grilled bacon & mushroom, triple grueye cheese, lettuce, tomato, straight cut fries with mesclun saladTriple Cheese Burger - $19.80Portion is large with reasonable pricing. Since we took advantage of the 50% discounts by using one of the food app, its really a good deal, just that the downside is that we have to dine at non-peak hours."

Just the sound of it is nostalgic. Having lived around this area all my life, Fong Seng has been a staple supper source ever since I was 17 (omg.. I've been eating here for 15 years??!!!) I'll be honest... The food's worth a 3 to 3.5 * but nostalgia and longevity counts for something right??Now... Where do I start...I'll try making this review as objectively as I can without being bias.Fong Seng has stood the test of time... Feeding generations of NUS students and the fact that it's still the most crowded food outlet along this stretch (Niqqi's has cut their shop space by half, teochew BKT, ice-cream store have since closed an even Joo Chiat's famous Tian Tian Wanton Mee, who opened an outlet here, only bring in 1/10th of Fong Sengs crowd at 12.30 in the morning), and still serves a pretty decent plate of Nasi Lemak. The rice here tends to be a bit subjective but more often than not, it has a lighter coconut fragrance but makes up for it with light fluffy rice, different from the drier variation that most places sell. Add-on's variety wise, Fong Seng is up there with the typical Chinese ran Nasi Lemak stalls. Come for supper and you'd be spoilt for choice with the different varieties available. The fish luncheon (yes... Fish) is worth trying, the chicken wings are good and I love the fact that they didn't fry their hashbrowns to death. Come during the day and you'll be greeted with even more variety, with the likes of chicken curry and curry vegetables available. The chilli, which most people feel is one of the most important key components of a Nasi Lemak, is pretty good too! Overall, Fong Seng is still a good Nasi Lemak joint, and at $3.80 for a plate with Luncheon meat, fried egg, fish cake and hashbrown, it still is decently priced and is still (as far as I know) the only 24 hours Nasi Lemak store that opens anywhere from Clementi to Redhill. Oh yes... And for Muslims, it's halal too."

Honestly, this place deserves 3 stars at best.  My hindbrain made me mouse over and click on the 4th.Practical tips:Parking is streetside for the brave.  Please do this only if you're young and stupid or too tired or piss-drunk (in which case you shouldn't be driving anyway) to care.  You get tickets lickety-split here.  Public carparks are down the street.  I've never had any stomach trouble here.  Although I haven't had everything on the menu every time I've been here...you can't?!  I've actually had an $11 plate of nasi lemak here before consisting of 20% of the menu of the day.  Most of what's on offer is very local and very quotidian, it's working-man's fare.  Don't ask for truffle oil unless you need a caning.My recommendations:  ikan bilis with peanuts.  fishcake, sotong balls, fried chicken wing, otah, fried egg, chili (more please...).  Washed down with Teh Gao (watch out for the spoon)."

Now Zam Zam is a restaurant Institution close to my heart cemented there by fond memories of  my dad and I going there for breakfast or late lunch on weekends,  or heading there with Army buddies after booking out on Saturdays while serving National Service. Okay so this review is turning out to be more of a review about Zam Zam  than Alif.The prata and murtabaks here have the crispy skin of light a light fluffy well-kneaded dough (with plenty of ghee!!  whee!) that is griddle-crisped to light brown perfection.  Zam Zam has started using olive oil, but I grew up with Muslim Indian food which menu items revolved like planets around a bright yellow sun of ghee! The curries here are bold.  I usually opt for the fish curry because I enjoy the tang of tamarind colliding with brash spicy notes of curry powder and curry leaf.  Few things are better or more local than prata plaster. For the uninitiated, plaster has less to do with caulking or speckling and more to do with band-aids and scabs.  The egg over easy is ""plastered"" onto the prata.  Pure genius.  I grew up with prata in the age before dinosaurs, milo dinosaurs that is, so I still just have it with what I associate most closely with prata and murtabak, teh halia or ginger milk tea.  Alif is a heartland refuge from mediocre food.  There's gems all over the Western heartland, just like Alif.  Go West,  young Yelper!"

Somehow, eating it together with the curry gives it a very satisfying taste, although the whole combination must be pretty sinful.

They have a variety of tasty food options, and they feature a lot of Malay and Indian style dishes. I'm a very hungry person, and since I'm more used to large American portions, I sample a variety of different dishes with each order. This time I tried the Mee Goreng Indian and Malay styles. For those of you who don't know, or are not native to Singapore like me, Mee Goreng is a fried noodle dish, and depending on which style you get, different seasonings are used. I don't remember which is which, as one style has a reddish color and the other more brown, but I really enjoyed both options. The food was flavorful and simply delicious. There was also a good meat to noodle ratio on my latest visit here, which is sometimes lacking at other food establishments because they would usually provide too much noodle and not enough meat. However, I found everything to be just right...I don't come here often enough to know whether or not that was by chance, but regardless I was impressed with my order.We had a large order, and the food was prepared for us very quickly, which always leaves me satisfied and impressed because that means I can get back to start eating sooner!

After seeing how Hua Tian was almost running at full capacity (around 15 tables) yesterday, as compared to my long beloved Joo Seng (about 4 tables), we decided we had to go back and see what all the fuss was about. Was Hua Tian really better than Joo Seng? Or was it only because it was newer, thus being more crowded as everyone likes trying something new. We got there around the same time, around 6.30pm and the place was already buzzing with around 8-9 tables taken. Upon reaching the counter, I could see instantly why this place was more popular. They had almost double the variety of sides as compared to Joo Seng, but it's not the quantity that counts, but the quality. So, we went about ordering some similar dishes, the braised mince pork (always a must have), the steamed egg and the salted egg. This time however, I decided to lay off the intestines and clams and went for the spinach and a pomfret instead. First, the pomfret. Cooked in traditional teochew fashion with salted vegetables, the fish was slightly overcooked. It lost a fair bit of its ""bounciness"" but overall still tasted very good. The sauce was perfect, not too salty. The spinach was next and I was pleased that it wasn't cooked to death. Still nice and green, the stems still had a bit of a crunch on them, which was nice. Next, the 3 similar dishes. Now, the mince pork here tasted so much nicer. Though spicier, you could distinctively taste the bean sauce they used and it was good.. Real good! My only issue is, there seemed to be some health promotion going on as the meat was again dry and a little hard, clearly lacking the bounce that pork fat normally gives to this dish. Flavour wise, it would definitely give the Havelock road porridge a run for its money, however, that still wins thanks to the right amount of fat in the dish, making is ""juicier"". The steamed egg at both stalls are very similar and almost impossible to tell apart. The salted egg however, wow.... I thought that generally, most restaurants who serve salted egg would probably get it from a similar supplier but how wrong I was! While the salted egg at Joo Seng was good, the salted eggs at Hua Tian made the salted eggs at Joo Seng seem like... Well... Just another salted egg. The yolk here is tastier, slightly saltier but has an almost creamy texture when you're eating it. It packs so much more flavour as compared to the Joo Seng one. Overall, I can see why this place is bringing in the crowd and if they maintain their standards, they're gonna be putting real pressure on Joo Seng. Will Joo Seng be able to bounce back or will this be another case of the ""Al-Ameen / Al Azhar Battle"" where the new boy prevails. Only time will tell but I'm sorry Joo Seng.. But..

And finally, I went early in the morning and got a taste of the so called famous bowl of noodle among the Bukit Panjang Estate.I still remember the first time that I was looking for the stall of Ke Kou Mian in the coffeeshop but had a hard time locating it as it was hidden behind the porridge sign board.Well, since porridge are the main display of the signboard, we bought a bowl of Century Egg and lean meat porridge with egg which includes a handful of cut fried fritters (you tiao).Century Egg Porridge with egg - $3Consistency of porridge was even and texture was rather ordinary. Each spoonful of the porridge was loaded with ingredients. Though there was nothing much to rave about, it still have the very old school and home cooking taste if you are looking for one.I'm not a person who is keen on spicy food on an empty stomach especially breakfast but it seems that these words of mouth recommendation are irresistible. Spicy Ke Kou Mian with egg was not something out nor within expectation. Broth looked spicy but in fact it was not so.Spicy Ke Kou Mian with egg - $3.50What I like about was that the portion of noodle was generous and ingredients consisted of liver, minced meat as well as vegetables. Dish may look very simple and served in a small bowl but it was a pocket friendly meal.With the city that never sleeps the night, this stall gives a very good alternative for supper if hunger pangs in the night. However, if you are going there for breakfast or lunch, be prepared to wait for about half an hour and as for lunch, be early as they usually close about 2pm."

Introducing Greendot, the solution to all seafood related allergies. I had the Laksa, which is completely vegan, with veggie prawn balls and straw mushrooms topped on the glorious dish. This tasted pretty much like the real thing, albeit with no grainy bits in the soup that is the by product of the seafood broth. My friend was just amazingly thrilled at the prospect of being about to eat laksa again. The prawn balls completely threw me off, as they were had such a similar texture to real prawns, i found it hard to believe it wasn'.t I also got to the try the rendang option with the bento. For the bento, you get one ""meat"" option, an 2 veggie sides which for me usually consists of pumpkin and broccoli. I came in with no expectations of this, having a lot of vegetarian meats that tasted like nothing, or had a texture that was more like a sponge. This flaked much like real meat, and I'm actually not sure of what the fake meat is, but there's probably mushrooms in it.This is definitely a must-try, a vegetarian version of local delights for anyone trying to be a little healthier or can't eat meat.

Normally, that'd be an easy pick with the options available along Lorong Kilat, but then I remembered seeing Keiko's review a couple weeks ago... and BAM. Decision made. We swung the car around into the back parking lot (now there's a tip, especially since the front one only lets season parkers get in, and you look like a fool waiting for someone to get out - yes we were those people for a while).Anyhow, entering Beauty World is like a massive blast from the past - we both had gone to school in the area, albeit at very different stages of our school lives, and it really doesn't look like this place has changed one bit since then. In fact, I don't think it's changed since it was built in... the 70s? I may be exaggerating, but not by much, I assure you.Back to the matter at hand, and this little Korean restaurant. So it's on the fourth floor, and as we take the escalator up, I was looking around for it, and I discovered the hawker centre. I kid you not, a hawker centre, on the rooftop kind of level, and its old school. And I digress. We hunt for a bit, gawk at the hawker centre a little more, then we find Joo Mak, plastered with pictures of bulgogi and other tasty delights, which only made me want to go in even more.We open the doors, and there's a counter, and one other table of two Korean ladies chatting super animatedly. Good sign that they're Korean, bad sign that it's just one other table?The owner-type lady comes out from behind her counter, hands us some menus, and we flip excitedly, and pick out the seafood pancake, and the classic bibimbap, but of course we are distracted by the other four pages of beautiful, beautiful food.Orders go in, and food comes out! Thank goodness there weren't that many other people here, otherwise I might have passed out from a mixture of jealousy from looking over at the two ajunmas.The lady brings out six appetisers, and they taste ZOMGAMAZING. Clean, simple flavours, and those crunchy pickles!? Woah. Next comes the hot stone bibimbap, with many a joyous crackle and pop, to which I quickly squeeze out that spicy sweet sauce and stir up that egg, and see it sizzle, and spoon some into my hungry face-hole, and of course, burning my tongue. Worth it? YES MA'AM EVERYTIME MA'AM. Okay so I stopped for a little and let it cool down to I might at least enjoy the flavours, instead of scalding every tastebud I had.That seafood pancake emerged, and it was more like a 12 inch pan pizza. HELLO. and it was DEEEEELIGHTFUL. Crisp and the bottom, without too much oil, and made even more amazing by that soy concoction the lady supplied... Wow. Just. Wow.We washed it down with some rice punch, and for a fleeting moment, I was in K-town para-para-paradise...Meal's done, and time to pay - to my very pleasant surprise, my wallet was as satisfied as our bellies and tastebuds were. We'd enjoyed great tasting Korean food, at a very reasonable price, and I'd gladly come back again with friends... just not too many, lest we get cross looks from the ajunmas whose seats we might have taken!"

Perhaps they make their own sauces, but I doubt it. The pizza is average, and the gnocchi is not up to snuff. It would be a fair choice it the dishes were not over-priced for their quality. A pizza can run you up to $15 here, and nothing of the entrées will be below $10! The servings are also relatively small.The service is friendly, and the decor is nice.

It's the simplest pizza one can make, and the standard will tell volumes about the rest of the dishes. I wasn't disappointed at all! Not going to spoil the surprise for you, so go ahead and try it out! The decor is pleasant, although the interior feels a bit warm if it gets too crowded. I'd recommend you sit alfresco anyway.

The stall is run by two brothers working together in tandem - one snipping all the ingredients and the other mixing them all together with their signature sauce. You can choose to add extras like cuttlefish fish or century egg but we went with the basics. The shrimp sauce is perfectly balanced - sweet yet delivering a slight spicy note. They are also very generous with the taupok and youtiao which is my favourite part. I also loved that the uncle asked me if I wanted the sauce separately for my takeaway order to keep the rojak fresher. These little touches despite the long queues they must work through really make the place. One of the best fruit rojaks I've had (I still prefer Indian rojak a bit more).

The fish ball soup stall next to it highlighted that there's no MSG in their soup. Indeed, it tasted like home-made soup.

But to find a good one at affordable prices is close to impossible. I am glad to discover that Miam Miam @ Westgate is such a place.Honestly, I love the fact that everything is made from scratch on order. Good things come to those who wait. And for a good soufflé, it is definitely worth the wait.We had the 'soufflé de nuage' - which is tomato sauteed rice with mushrooms and ham. And it is topped with a superbly fluffy egg and cheese cloud. Yes, you read correctly, not a typo. The egg and cheese on top really is a heavenly cloud of fluffyness. Most important, all the flavours were not overpowering, just the right amount of lightness marry into a perfect blend.Next up was the complimentary soufflé pancake since it was my birthday. Of course, compared to the de nuage, it may be a little ordinary. Nonetheless, it was a very well made thick pancake with soufflé fluffyness on the inside.Finally, we came to the real soufflé soufflé. The hardest things to do make well are often the simplest. And I'm glad to say the vanilla soufflé pass the test with flying colours. Not too sweet not too creamy, just the right amount of fluffyness (i cant help it, no other words describe it better). As it sat there and began its slow collapse, you are instantly reminded to eat it while its warm. For soufflé lovers, this place is a definitely worth a visit. Best of all, they have 4 outlets in all every corner of our island.Aside: Thusfar, one of my favourite soufflé in Singapore is Laurent Bernard's rum and raisin soufflé @ Robertson Quay. This is definitely almost as good."

I'll start with the good stuff. The dude and I needed a place to eat at the Jurong mall area that could be done in an hour since we had an appointment. We were headed for a brunch place we remembered on the 2nd floor of Westgate (I think), but then  saw Miam Miam and it's ""made from scratch"" headlines and decided to pop by. We ordered the curry rice and teriyaki chicken pasta since we didn't have time for souffles and then proceeded to wait, since the waitress said the food would take ""20 minutes because its made from scratch"". I was all happy thinking wow we finally found a restaurant that makes food from scratch and doesn't pass off Angliss stuff for $15/serving.Well we waited. We found our seats a little cold so we moved to a table outside and continued to wait. I literally thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt with the longer than usual cooking time because they were making the effort to cook  something good. 45 minutes later....yes sir, I actually waited 45 minutes before saying anything, I asked a young female waitress to check on our food. She went inside the restaurant and didn't come back. Great, that's fine, I'm used to unprofessional service. I went inside and looked for a waitress that appeared to at least have cleared teenage hood. She said she would check on our order.We waited again. Finally I buzzed for service the said lady came out and apologized. Our orders were keyed into their ""new"" electronic order system and they didn't go through to the kitchen. Yea I was kind of pissed. I did however manage to ask, somewhat incredulously, how a restaurant service team can rely solely on technology to wait tables. It's totally possible in Singapore because waiters don't bus a certain section but man, it takes really really bad staff management to not have a waiter realize the order you put in 45 mins ago hadn't come through.To the lady's credit (I think she was the manager), she apologized, gave us free minestrone soup (don't pay for it, your mama makes better soup I promise), comped our drink order and watched our table like a hawk. My pasta came pretty quickly after the error was realized but the dude's curry took a good 10 mins more to arrive. The teriyaki chicken pasta was tasty though a little too saucy for my book, while the curry in a hot pan was delicious. But then we could've just been really, really hungry at that point.Moral of the story? Uh... budget an hour and a half for a 1 course meal."

I also sprinkled garlic bits liberally over my noodles just for the extra kick.We ordered a few other stuff such as the pig trotters and the cod fish. The pig trotters (cooked in vinegar were really wow! Very tender and satisfying; it's no doubt one of the better pig trotters that I've come across. The cod fish (cooked into bits with an almost-uncooked raw egg yolk on top of it) was spectacular as well: creamy and satisfying.

As other posters have pointed out, it's a venue that specialises in Halal ""zi char"" (stir-fry), so you get the usual dishes like sambal kangkong, hot plate tofu, shrimp paste chicken wings, cereal prawns, etc etc...basically the zi char experience in an air-conditioned mall (very similar to what you get at Far East Plaza), with a strong consistency across dishes.The specialty of this place is Curry Fish Head. Seriously, if you come here, just get this, otherwise you're just wasting your time here. It costs $16 and comes in a generous portion that feeds 4 (I get aggressive sometimes and order this even when there's only 2 of us here). You'll notice that every table has one of this and they do both the Nonya and Assam style, so pick your poison. They do enough quantities on a daily basis that it's fresh and cheap.One thing to note is that this place generally gets very crowded during mealtimes, but they do take your number and ask you to take a walk around the mall. Turnover is pretty quick, usually a 10-20mins wait, so don't get frightened off if they ask you to come back later!And oh, did I mention, a zi char place that takes American Express cards in Singapore?

Meat was tender and awesomely done.This is not the usual carbonara that get soaked in a pool of cream (even though I prefer that style). One of the perks of this dish is the generous use of sausage as well as pork meat.Carbonara - $14Given the homely ambiance and relaxing environment, its hard not to be back again.

The chicken chop was soso, with a light crust, and a tender inside, the seasoning didn't stand out, and the mushroom sauce was essentially a tasteless brown gravy with canned mushrooms. The pepper sauce fared better, with a bit more punch. The sides were coleslaw and fried potato wedges. The coleslaw was your run-of-the-mill mayonnaise-laden cabbage, but I really liked the potato wedges, which were freshly fried and not from a packet, but cut potatoes.

Starving as always, I gobbled it down in mere minutes, the batter wasn't too thick and the meat was tender and moist. As delicious as it was, I wouldn't jump on the tagline of BEST chicken chop I've ever had in Malaysia but it undoubtedly ranks up there"

What's so great about the bowls of noodle, let's check it out.Our frequent order from the stall will be Bee Tai Mak Dry in its smallest available portion at $4 per bowl.  For those who prefer more vinegar in their minced meat noodle will definitely appreciate the ""uncontrolled"" use of black vinegar in their noodles.Minced Meat Noodle (Dry) - $4 (Small)Noodles were springy and complemented well with the sauce. Ingredients were generous in its thick cut braised mushrooms, handful of minced meat and noodles stand up with its fragrant fried sole fish.Minced Meat Noodle (Dry) - $6 (Big)Overall, Ah Kow's noodle is some food that we will return for its taste and generous portion.Apart from food, I notice that the stall owner has passion in running the business. On several occasions, I noticed that his white shirt was totally drenched either in his sweat or most probably from the steaming vapour of his soup, but such thing has never stop him from serving out more delicious bowls of Minced Meat Noodle!"

Operating hours are 11am to 3pm for lunch and 5.30pm to 10pm for dinner.Sakura serves a wide variety of food from Western, Japanese and Oriental food. For those who have been to a Sakura buffet in other branches, you will probably find no difference in the offerings from Admiralty park. The dining experience is, however, one of the best that the chain has to offer. Customer service is certainly one of the best I have experienced, with friendly staff and fast topping up of empty food trays. As an international buffet there will be many different food to accommodate to various taste such as japanese sushi , asian delicacies and lots of different desserts ranging from cakes to puddings. Drinks are free flow and the variety is just a vast, from different kinds of soft drinks to coffee and tea.What really set this branch apart is the environment and ambience. It offers an outdoor alfresco dining, overlooking a lotus pond in Admiralty Park. For those who dislike outdoor dining, fear not as there is also indoor dining where air conditioning is available.Overall, it is a value for money dining experience and certain not to disappoint."

Papa John's, which has been in Singapore since 2015, is no longer Halal certified as of late 2015 (or early 2016).We had the Sausage and Bacon pizza.The first thing I noticed on biting into a slice was the crispy bacon on top, adding a hearty crunch to the slice. The cheese, meat and ingredients in general were of good quality - a definite cut above the other American pizza chains (even Domino's, which is the best of the rest).In particular, the mozzarella was very generously scattered and was of very good quality, and the tomato sauce was really intense with a strong tomato flavour (which you don't find even at the good Italian pizza places here).Everything combined in a savory, gooey explosion in my mouth.We topped up to get a stuffed cheese crust at only 3 bucks for a large pizza, and there was a lot of (good) cheese inside.I wasn't hot about the garlic dipping sauce though, as it didn't really go with the pizza. But the pizza is awesome enough as it is so that isn't a problem.This outlet feels rather remote, but even though it's within walking distance of an MRT stop, the crowds don't seem to think it's worth it (Singaporeans like their shopping centres to be linked directly to their MRT stations). So during a late Saturday lunch there weren't many people in either the shopping centre or the restaurant. There weren't so few people that the area was deserted but just enough to give it a relaxed suburban feel (and in my other visits to this shopping centre I've found the same). So this outlet's location is actually a plus (at least once you get there).There are some minor downsides though.If you're intending to order this for delivery, their only outlets (as of the time of writing) are in Hillview and Tampines so coverage is limited.Their largest pizza, appropriately titled the large pizza, at 12 inches isn't that large, so if you're feeding large groups, take that into account.Finally, the pizza is also a bit pricier than at other American pizza places. But oh, is it worth it."

But this is pretty much your own option once you entered the park. It's located right past the pandas and by the polar bear exhibit, halfway through the park. They pretty much have a captive audience, since the nearest place to get a full meal is the Tea House, which is a walk back across the entire park and outside the turnstiles. And it's air conditioned, so a decently place to wait for either the polar bear feeding (which doesn't actually seem to always happen on time???) or the Amazon River Quest that you booked.It's a Chinese restaurant with pretty limited selection, but with a lot of panda themed items.I got the spicy beef noodle soup, which was supposed to come with mango pudding, but they were out for some reason, so they gave me a tapioca pudding instead, which was okay, but I wanted my mango! The beef noodle soup was acceptable. The picture on the menu shows that it is supposed to come with a decent amount of lotus root chips as well, but it only came with like 4. Sad beans. Overall it was pretty pricey as well, coming out to something like 16.5 Singaporean dollars.My companion did not seem to like her braised pot dish.

There was a really delicious tomato sauce that came with it though and it was really refreshing.The mutton curry biryani that I had here was one of the best biryanis that I've had.

There is the option of which part of the duck/chicken you'd like should you order their roasted specials, and an additional $2 for the leg.

The room is well spaced, with a comfortable feeling (see pic).The food was absolutely delicious.We had a half Peking duck which yielded ten little pancakes in which slivers of the skin and meat were nestled. As with most purveyors, the remaining meat was then taken back to the kitchen to turn into a polished fried rice dish (we could have opted for noodles).We also enjoyed:- Roasted crispy pork. These crispy little cubes were absolute heaven! I ordered the same thing later that day at another well known restaurant...no where near as good as these were. I could easily opt for a big plate of these for my last supper- Fried silver fish. If it weren't for their tiny black eyes, you would assume a plate of Mickey D's fries!- Flaky pastry with shredded turnip in a crazily shaped dough- Steamed Shanghainese dumplings (nearly impossible to coral onto the serving spoon or grab with the sticks...you might ask for a fork, particularly if you're in a hurry)- Panfried stuffed red chili, green chili and eggplant ...There was NOT a miss in the bunch!While I feel we were well served, I can appreciate some of the service related comments offered by other yelpers. While hard working, staff could be a bit ""smoother around the edges,"" and interactions were sometimes abrupt. They were constantly ensuring our tea cups were full...if I were a bit more jet lagged I might had minded the frequency. Language was uneven across the staff, such using the wrong word or our needing to repeat..but, again, we really didn't mind.To the contrary one of our many servers was very polished and extremely customer focused, having done a great job. Among a myriad of duties (including rolling a table through the dining room), he was on point for the Peking duck experience!I can only speak to the midday dim sum experience, but we feel this was a home run and a memorable experience...a definite recommend."

Apparently they rotate the head chefs among their hotels worldwide to refresh the menu. But the staple or favorite dishes will remain. I was back there last night and discovered the new chef came in 3 months ago and the menu has been tweaked slightly. So certain items which my friend raved about were no longer there. So do go back often if you like a particular dish as it may not be around a few years later. My favorite dishes are a white pizza and cannolo dessert from a few years ago. I am hoping they will bring that back again. The white pizza was simply brushed with olive oil and herbs and topped with parma ham, mushrooms and cheese. So simple and so good. The cannolo was filled with sweet cream and served with a scoop of ice cream and fruits. Again the simplicity just blew me away. Back to the current menu, it was also very good. I am glad the ""family style"" concept of the previous chef is gone. I stopped going for a while as I found the dishes too hearty. A whole roast chicken? But they retained the antipasti spread which is nice. Based on past experiences, we found the food can be a bit too rich so we decided to share the dishes. It was a good thing too as we still could not finish our dishes. The pumpkin and mushroom risotto looked plain but it was full of flavor and was also cheesy. The fusili had plenty of real crab meat (in chunks so you do not have to search for it) and asparagus and was also a bit jelak (too rich) after a while. The only white pizza on the menu now had a cream base so it was not what I had in mind. We decided to get the Italiana which had buffalo mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes (very sweet and juicy) and arugula on it. This was equally delicious though I wished there were more of the mozzarella on it. Dessert was not as good compared to the mains. Maybe we should have stuck to gelato and tiramisu instead. The tiramisu is always good here. If you cannot decide what to have, the set dinner option is a good deal at $69 and it generally have pretty good dishes. I do think the prices are a bit on the high side, and it makes me wonder if it is catered to the FAR/AMEX card members where they can get discount of up to 50% (depending on number of diners)."

""Chef hat only"" cuz you can only select the items with the chef hat logo.We ordered a dinner set, and added on an anti pasti of foie gras and a pizza for 3 to share. We've got aged parma ham for anti pasti selection, a linguini (small serving size was served instead of its normal serving size for set dinner), and a tiramisu. Chef daily special was beef stew with carrots and roasted potatoes. As usual for an Italian dining, bread was served for appetizer with home made truffle butter! The truffle butter was delicious! Olive oil served upon request only.Aged parma ham was served with rock melon and it rocked. We were pretty surprised with the serving size of the linguini though, as it looked like a $5 pasta when served. Really.....Roasted foie gras and pizza (Rustica) was really nice and we totally enjoyed it.Dinner ended with a coffee, tea and tiramisu, and our night feels complete!Waiters are rather attentive to us at all times, despite the huge restaurant space they occupy!

Pretty much everything I tried was well-made.The layout is very confusing. It's in two divisions and you have to walk ~80ft to get to the other side to see what's there. The service is what really annoyed me. During a late breakfast, the whole service crew aggressively turns over the front of house for lunch. They were slamming glasses, chairs, plates, silverware, etc like as if they were on a time limit. By doing that, it pretty much tells the patrons to ""get out"", it's terribly loud and doesn't make for a relaxing breakfast. At the higher price of this place, you'd expect much better than that.

However, the portion is a tad small, but that is pretty normal of ravioli orders.The braised lamb shank is usually beautifully cooked. Tender and juicy. Mm.Definitely leave some space for their signature Tiramisu. The $14 price tag doesnt come cheap, but it is well worth the price tag!If you have an Amex platinum card with the free far card gourmet membership, the discount is 50% for 2 diners, 33% for 3 diners, 25% for four diners and 20% for five diners and above. Pretty decent prices after the discount if you ask me!"

The beef in Carpaccio di Manzo is thinly sliced and melts in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the well seasoned dish. The mushrooms on Funghi Misti pizza were juicy and fragrant; the thin base and crust helped enhance the taste.

Prego's brunch buffet changes depending on what they have during that season. The first time we went there, they were offering a selection of fresh fruit juice, foie gras and scallops as part of their buffet. Another time we went there, they had a breakfast selection of eggs benedict, scramble eggs and you can order fruits smoothie made fresh from the kitchen from your waitress (it is part of the buffet). The only things that remained unchanged were the cold cuts section which served parma ham, salami, capicola etc. There's also a nice selection of cheese and crackers next to the cold cuts. The salad section was fairly generous. I loved their salmon salad. They have a roast section where there's duck, beef cheeks, braised ox tail, pan grilled salmon, breaded calami rings etc. They have a seafood section where there's oysters, scallops, prawns and mussels. Of course, being an italian restaurant, they have a chef there to cook the pasta of your choice fresh for you. It's a family oriented restaurant where there's a children's section near the roast food section for kids to play, run around and eat at. The highlight of this place for me was their dessert section. Tiramisu, apple fritters fried before your eyes then sprinkled with brown sugar and caramel sauce served onto your plate warm, a mountain of chocolate profiteroles, chocolate mousse, vodka and wine jelly shots,  biscotti, ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta, flan.. oh you name it, they have it. It's desserts heaven for a desserts lover like me. Prego's Sunday Brunch also offers champagne but it comes with an added cost to your total bill. The service was great as well. It is definitely worth a try if you are looking for a filling Sunday Brunch."

Apparently they rotate the head chefs among their hotels worldwide to refresh the menu. But the staple or favorite dishes will remain. I was back there last night and discovered the new chef came in 3 months ago and the menu has been tweaked slightly. So certain items which my friend raved about were no longer there. So do go back often if you like a particular dish as it may not be around a few years later. My favorite dishes are a white pizza and cannolo dessert from a few years ago. I am hoping they will bring that back again. The white pizza was simply brushed with olive oil and herbs and topped with parma ham, mushrooms and cheese. So simple and so good. The cannolo was filled with sweet cream and served with a scoop of ice cream and fruits. Again the simplicity just blew me away. Back to the current menu, it was also very good. I am glad the ""family style"" concept of the previous chef is gone. I stopped going for a while as I found the dishes too hearty. A whole roast chicken? But they retained the antipasti spread which is nice. Based on past experiences, we found the food can be a bit too rich so we decided to share the dishes. It was a good thing too as we still could not finish our dishes. The pumpkin and mushroom risotto looked plain but it was full of flavor and was also cheesy. The fusili had plenty of real crab meat (in chunks so you do not have to search for it) and asparagus and was also a bit jelak (too rich) after a while. The only white pizza on the menu now had a cream base so it was not what I had in mind. We decided to get the Italiana which had buffalo mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes (very sweet and juicy) and arugula on it. This was equally delicious though I wished there were more of the mozzarella on it. Dessert was not as good compared to the mains. Maybe we should have stuck to gelato and tiramisu instead. The tiramisu is always good here. If you cannot decide what to have, the set dinner option is a good deal at $69 and it generally have pretty good dishes. I do think the prices are a bit on the high side, and it makes me wonder if it is catered to the FAR/AMEX card members where they can get discount of up to 50% (depending on number of diners)."

""Chef hat only"" cuz you can only select the items with the chef hat logo.We ordered a dinner set, and added on an anti pasti of foie gras and a pizza for 3 to share. We've got aged parma ham for anti pasti selection, a linguini (small serving size was served instead of its normal serving size for set dinner), and a tiramisu. Chef daily special was beef stew with carrots and roasted potatoes. As usual for an Italian dining, bread was served for appetizer with home made truffle butter! The truffle butter was delicious! Olive oil served upon request only.Aged parma ham was served with rock melon and it rocked. We were pretty surprised with the serving size of the linguini though, as it looked like a $5 pasta when served. Really.....Roasted foie gras and pizza (Rustica) was really nice and we totally enjoyed it.Dinner ended with a coffee, tea and tiramisu, and our night feels complete!Waiters are rather attentive to us at all times, despite the huge restaurant space they occupy!

Pretty much everything I tried was well-made.The layout is very confusing. It's in two divisions and you have to walk ~80ft to get to the other side to see what's there. The service is what really annoyed me. During a late breakfast, the whole service crew aggressively turns over the front of house for lunch. They were slamming glasses, chairs, plates, silverware, etc like as if they were on a time limit. By doing that, it pretty much tells the patrons to ""get out"", it's terribly loud and doesn't make for a relaxing breakfast. At the higher price of this place, you'd expect much better than that.

Not too creamy, strong mushroom taste, smooth and not too heavy. The ravioli is deserving of mention too. However, the portion is a tad small, but that is pretty normal of ravioli orders.The braised lamb shank is usually beautifully cooked. Tender and juicy. Mm.Definitely leave some space for their signature Tiramisu. The $14 price tag doesnt come cheap, but it is well worth the price tag!If you have an Amex platinum card with the free far card gourmet membership, the discount is 50% for 2 diners, 33% for 3 diners, 25% for four diners and 20% for five diners and above. Pretty decent prices after the discount if you ask me!"

The beef in Carpaccio di Manzo is thinly sliced and melts in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the well seasoned dish. The mushrooms on Funghi Misti pizza were juicy and fragrant; the thin base and crust helped enhance the taste.

Prego's brunch buffet changes depending on what they have during that season. The first time we went there, they were offering a selection of fresh fruit juice, foie gras and scallops as part of their buffet. Another time we went there, they had a breakfast selection of eggs benedict, scramble eggs and you can order fruits smoothie made fresh from the kitchen from your waitress (it is part of the buffet). The only things that remained unchanged were the cold cuts section which served parma ham, salami, capicola etc. There's also a nice selection of cheese and crackers next to the cold cuts. The salad section was fairly generous. I loved their salmon salad. They have a roast section where there's duck, beef cheeks, braised ox tail, pan grilled salmon, breaded calami rings etc. They have a seafood section where there's oysters, scallops, prawns and mussels. Of course, being an italian restaurant, they have a chef there to cook the pasta of your choice fresh for you. It's a family oriented restaurant where there's a children's section near the roast food section for kids to play, run around and eat at. The highlight of this place for me was their dessert section. Tiramisu, apple fritters fried before your eyes then sprinkled with brown sugar and caramel sauce served onto your plate warm, a mountain of chocolate profiteroles, chocolate mousse, vodka and wine jelly shots,  biscotti, ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta, flan.. oh you name it, they have it. It's desserts heaven for a desserts lover like me. Prego's Sunday Brunch also offers champagne but it comes with an added cost to your total bill. The service was great as well. It is definitely worth a try if you are looking for a filling Sunday Brunch."

The restaurant is inspired by the 16th century Habsburg Empire, which encompasses current day countries such as Austria, Bosnia, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Northern Italy.It wasn't particularly easy to find as the restaurant is located on the 2nd and 3rd floors above the entrance to the theater. It took a while to figure out where the elevator/escalator to the 2nd floor was located. Upon entry, I observed the rather grand decor with plush seating and gold plated looking ornaments.I went for couple of Austrian options like Austria's ""national"" dish, Wiener Schnitzel (the breaded veal version), the Kasekrainer (Austrian Pork Cheese Sausages) and Tafelspitzsulze Beef Aspic. The Wiener Schnitzel is one of the better ones that I've tried, rather crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, but one of the pieces was a tad bit drier than expected. The sausages were also pretty good, nicely grilled, but bordered on overly salty. The sauerkraut and potatoes were tasty and not sour, it pretty much beat any version served up by the other German and central European restaurants in Singapore.Executive Chef Hans Lüftenegger (formerly at Brotzeit) and Executive Pastry Chef Patrick helm the kitchen, and the quality of the food shows. The restaurant also serves a large selection of pastries displayed in a glass case, and ""Zaunerstollen"" from the Austrian patisserie Zauner (wafers coated in chocolate), and coffee from Julius Meinl. The chocolate cake was heavenly...The restaurant seemed to be moderately filled with customers, but I'm wondering if there's mass appeal in serving Austrian/Hungarian food that the crowd may not be familiar with. Competition is tough in the restaurant scene here. I'm impressed that they stuck to the theme and this is a rare find for cuisine in Singapore. I had a good dinner and I hope to be back for a second visit to try the rest of the items on the menu."

The French fries were pretty parsimonious to be honest, but the wedges were a bit more substantial for the price. And we were able to get the toppings on-the-side (American style) with no difficulty, which I thought was good. The burger buns were white sesame-seed buns, toasted nicely, and not just warmed, and so had a satisfying crunch to them. My meat pattie was medium-rare. I would prefer to have a choice and get it medium. Perhaps I did have that choice? But it wasn't an option on the menu and I wasn't asked. Unless I can't count, my double-pattie (super cheesy burger) was only a single pattie. The man taking our orders was pleasant enough, but the lady who delivered our burgers just plonked them on the table with nary a word or explanation of which was which until we asked her.All in all, I'd happily come here again for a burger fix. Only thing to be aware of its that the menu is apparently new, and right now they don't have the salad available."

Cheap, okay quality meat. Upon coming here, I was extremely surprised to see a totally upgraded menu with good quality meats and a variety of dishes. Ordered so much for four people, we could barely finish everything. Australian wgayu platter $230- rib eye, rump cap, sirloin, tongue, etc... Everything was amazing. Melt in your mouth goodness. So much fat and tenderness and flavor...Japanese A3 wgayu- surprisingly not as tender as the Australian. Maybe because it's a3? Still extremely tender though, and more flavor. I actually liked this one better. Seafood platter- pretty full by this point. Comes with giant prawns, scallops, salmon, oysters. It was decent, the prawn was the best. Maybe it wasn't as good because I was already extremely full?Also got the banchan, mushrooms, fried rice, and ice cream to top off the meal. All great compliments to the meal. Overall, best gyu kaku meal I've had. Everything was top notch quality, and it's really difficult to find this type of quality in la. Yum. I am salivating thinking about this meal. Definitely giving gyu kaku in other countries a chance!"

We also ordered more plates of wagyu beef, pork belly and chicken. A waitress took the initiative to barbecue everything for us! Everything was cooked perfectly. When I bit into the beef it was slightly charred on the outside but sooo tender on the inside, bursting with beef juices.It was also my first time eating beef tongue, and it was quite delicious!! I'm not sure if that's because it is wagyu beef, but it tasted so juicy and flavorful and tongue-like actually...but maybe that's psychological.Also, the kimchi soup was the best kimchi soup I've ever had!!!! It's really delicious and a must-try if you love spicy food!! It wasn't too sour like how kimchi usually is, it was more sweet and was served piping hot!I guess the only downside is that it is quite expensive, but honestly you are paying for what you get! If you really have the money to splurge then it is worth it, especially if you like beef.Great ambience, great service and great food!!

If you were to ask me to point out anything special about it, I would say the sushi is definitely a nicer and brighter shade than Sakae Sushi. To be fair though, I am quite partial to Sushi Tei's cha soba (green tea) and their gindara. This time though, I decided to try this curious (ok maybe to the Japanese it's like a typical meal) looking dish with raw tuna, a half boiled egg and lots of spring onions. Pardon me if you are Japanese and the way I handled this dish is completely wrong, but to me I took it as a sign that this dish is meant to be mixed Pepper Lunch style. I mixed it all up and sprinkled glorious Japanese chilli flakes all over and begun the meal. Like all mixed up dishes.. it was delicious. I loved how the tuna meat, spring onions and egg gelled the rice together. Though my way of eating this dish may be wrong, it still is a dish worth a try! If you don't want to risk looking like a total fool (since the method of eating this dish may be wrong), stick to the Cha Soba.. you can't go wrong with dunking green tea noodle in a cup of its ice-cold broth."

Eating there is personal, comfy and intimate.What I Love: Their service. They are swift and prompt. Their Wakame Salad is yummy. Cha Soba serving is huge. Tip: If you're having the Cha Soba, do no order anything else. Their Green Tea is freshly brewed. Agedashi Tofu is totally yumminess. All their meat options are really yummy, so try everything!

You are led to the seating area via a raised wooden platform with dimmed lighting and bamboo archways, making us feel like super VIPs! There is also more privacy offered to patrons with little booths that are sectioned off as well, which is always a good thing. The food itself is above average, with a wide range of delicious sushi platters with great combinations like lobster meat with avocado, or sashimi with mango slices. It may sound out of the ordinary, but tastes fresh and yummy. My favourite dish is their salads, mainly because I love their Wafu sauces that they drizzle atop the vegetables. It isn't too salty but still gives flavor to the otherwise bland raw veggies, but most importantly, isn't full of calories like Western sauces such as Thousand Island or Balsamic Vinegar. It is quite pricey though, so I can't really visit it as often as I would like."

I ordered the Omaha Rib-eye with foie gras as extra, bearnaise sauce and asparagus with sun dried tomatoes as a side. First of all, I ordered my steak rare and when it arrived it was everything but rare but I must admit, this was immediately corrected by the staff and they gave us a complimentary dessert so I will not hold that against them.The main reason for rating them 3-stars is that I was very underwhelmed by the food. Don't get me wrong, it was certainly not bad but when I pay close to 200$ a person, I want to be wow-ed and I was not. The steak and foie were (once corrected) executed correctly, the sides were also ok but nothing really extraordinary. The bearnaise was rather disappointing, I do agree that the steak was of decent quality, so it did not really need extra sauce, but I believe if you serve it, you should make sure it is good. Also, the dessert, while free, was nothing special.In addition, I found the staff, while friendly, not very pro-active, I had to ask several times to top up my water glass and in general, it was difficult to waive them down, even though the place was not very busy.Next time I have a craving for steak and saved up some cash, most likely, I will take it somewhere else.

But this was my first time at the Long Bar Steakhouse and boy, I was definitely impressed. I had myself a Caesar with smoked salmon for an appetizer, and for a starter, it was huge! I'm not too impressed with it as a whole but, Caesar can't really be elevated much - I did appreciate that they were really generous with the smoked salmon. By the time I finished half my salad, I was quite stuffed! The main was a Filet Mignon, rare. I would've tried blue but I wasn't too confident (nothing to do with LBSH, just many failed attempts at blue from other renowned steakhouses has left me scarred). But, I think even Gordon Ramsay would approve of the colour of the steak. It was nicely salted, I would recommend that if you choose the Steakhouse Butter (think that's the name), you can take it off the top of your steak after a bit. It does add to the flavour but, might make it a tad too salty. And of course, I ordered a foie gras to add to the cut. O.M.G. if you have never had steak and foie gras together in the same mouthful before, you need to try it. At least once. Trust me. Of course they taste just as great when apart - though I would've liked my foie gras slightly more seared, it was perfectly fatty and creamy. I'm a huge fan of fries, but my partner recommended the mash instead - ohmy. it was buttery and creamy - though, I would've loved it to be slightly more creamy, but it was a small thing that doesn't change my liking for it. I wasn't too impressed but the sautéed spinach, but that's probably cause I like creamed spinach more. (Yes, I think there is a trend, I like creamy stuff.)Dessert, was a tangy lemon tart with raspberry sorbet. It was definitely yummy - I cannot tell you how awesome the little lemon peaks were. The tart was a little too sweet on its own but paired with everything, including the sorbet, the flavours just melt together. OMNOM. Definitely will be back, sometime in the future."

The only reason I tried them in the first place was because I was starving and no other eatery in that mall appealed to me. I ordered the Martian's Delight and was delighted to find that it was the best salad wrap I've ever had. (Martian's Delight: romaine lettuce, roasted mango chicken, pumpkin, cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, wasabi mayo dressing. I'll usually have it in a spinach wrap.)I'm hardly in the Tanjong Pagar area so I was delighted to hear they would be opening their 2nd outlet at Raffles City. I've been coming to this location regularly since they opened in Jan and simply love it. My only gripe, the portion of mango chicken in the wrap seems to be getting smaller. $9.90 is not cheap for a salad wrap so wish they'd be a tad more generous. The last time I went, I asked for a double portion of mango chicken for an extra $2.50. On a related note, I am always delighted when served by one particular preparer at this location because he always tops up the mango chicken if he thinks the first preparer has been a little too stingy.5 out of 10 times I'm at Raffles City now I'll eat here as I'm trying to get more greens into my diet.This is a must try for you salad & wrap affictionados and Subway-alternative seekers."

Their roast pork appetizer was ridiculously small. Most dim sum items were around $7-8 SGD. Literally, dim sum here cost double what it is in Chicago, and not even as good.

However, having just returned from Hong Kong a few days before my lunch at Wah Lok, I was disappointed to discover that the dim sum at Wah Lok, despite being one of Singapore's best dim sum restaurants, still can't compare to the typical dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. The porridge was boring (perhaps its the nature of the dish?) and unmemorable but more significantly, I thought it was overpriced. The Po Lo Bao receives rave reviews online but I was let down by the thick pastry crust and overly starchy char siew filling. I prefer a light, fresh and crisp pastry crust. The chee cheong fun was also thick, and did not have a delicate, translucent texture, which I would have preferred.Perhaps standards are dipping. I'll probably check out other dim sum restaurants in Singapore."

I wanted to check out this place like forever. Finally I managed to come here during my past trip in Singapore.FOOD 5/5Solid tonkotsu ramen. Tonkotsu ramen is a specialty of Hakata in Fukuoka in Japan. Authentic tonkotsu are made by simmering pork bones for a very long period of time, which then create the signature thick and creamy broth with a layer of foam. That would be how you know you are served with a 100% legit tonkotsu ramen.Hakata Ikkousha was founded by a man named Kousuke Yoshimura who won the Ramen Championship in 2011.So did the ramen at Hakata Ikkousha live up to their name? Definitely!! The broth was thick and so creamy. The chashu was so soft and tasty, though a tad thin for my liking. SERVICE 5/5The staffs here were older ladies who were the motherly type. They were nice and friendly. AMBIENCE 3/5Okay the only thing I wanted to complain was the ambience. It was so hot here. We had to wait in line outside the store. Granted the entire restaurant was indoor at Chjimes. Holy cow! there was no AC outside the restaurant. It was not super cooling inside the restaurant as well.

In fact this is the first time we find a Singapore ramen place that approaches the legend.Thin, al dente noodles, a pork broth that remains flavourful at the light option and stays balanced in the classic (no floating congealed fat like at Keisuke), roast pork that tastes like roast pork not Cold Storage ham, tender bamboo shoots... it is competently done. At $12 for shio it is on the cheaper side, although ramen for $12 is definitely not Japanese.Not much else to be said. In all other respects it is pretty much like all the other ramen joints in Singapore, tight space, loud music, queue, order on little sheets, etc. Also, about half the shop is a Faraday cage so Instagram and WhatsApp will have to wait after the bill is paid (which kind of sucks if you want to claim your J Passport gyoza).Oh, and no Ichiran red sauce.

Sitting beside the windows also make you feel like in the 90s, as you overlook into the old Bras Basah Complex.You won't find a crowd here and that is a good thing, but what they do serve up here is traditional of Jack's Place and a little taste of the British style western food.

You can't miss the restaurant as it is located right across the iconic Raffles Hotel (North Bridge Road side)  and in the same building as The Loof - the rooftop bar everyone is raving about. We made reservation 2 weeks in advance just because we have a big group and to ensure we have a table secured for us during the peak brunch / lunch period on a Saturday. Kudos to the team - the table was set up nicely when we reached and the service was prompt. We browsed through the extensive menu and picked a few dim sum staples like har kow, siew mai, liu sar pao, cheong fun and etc. All were decent, nothing spectacular, the standard you would expect from a chinese restuarant. Since chinese new year is just around the corner, we ordered a big plate of  salmon ""yu sheng"", a raw fish salad to toss in good fortune for the upcoming lunar new year. The 'Yu sheng"" priced at $88 for the big portion was very overpriced looking at the portion and the very thin slices of salmon (2 small plates with 5 to 6 slices/plate) while the rest are just pickled vegetables and crackers. I would pay $50 max but to charge this exorbitant price just because it's in high demand now is just absurd. Lucky, to  balance things out, Asia Grand do have peking duck promotion ($38 whole duck) and each table is only entitled for single order. We ordered the peking duck as well and it was good. Whole duck was brought to our table where the restaurant captain did her magic, carving the crispy skin and then wrapped in thin crepe to be eaten with hoisin sauce. Delicious!  The remaining of the duck meat can either be eaten as it is or you can request the kitchen to cook it the way you desire (with noodles or porridge, each with different surcharge, of course)For dessert, we had red bean pancake (""wor peng"") and glutinous rice ball (mochi) with black sesame filling. Overall, we paid a total bill of $370 to be shared among  13 of us. Asia Grand definitely needs to live up to its expectation and maintain the food standard looking at the tight competition within that area - Wah Lok at Carlton Hotel and Royal China at Raffles Hotel.

When my parents are in the mood to splurg, I also enjoy the geoduck clam/ lobster sashimi/ steamboat. Otherwise, food here can never go wrong, although standards may vary depending on the number of customers/ how crowded the restaurant is."

I've been here a few times for family dinner and a few business lunches. The service is professional and experienced.My most recent meal here was a CNY lunch and these are some of the dishes:1) Yusheng. Nicely balanced seasoning. Fresh veg. I really liked the fried salmon skin that was really light and crispy. They DID use some salmon sashimi despite the recent raw fish scare. The crispy crackers were very crunchy and in copious amounts - always a highlight for me to have generous crackers.2) The fish maw super soup - light and not gluey. Some more expensive menus I've had recently seem to have a more gluey consistency which is really too heavy for a lunch with so many courses. This was not bad and quite a lot of fish maw in it but not that special in terms of the soup flavour. Could be a bit more intense.3) Fried pippa duck. Nice crispy bits but some parts of the meat were a little chewy. I had limited stomach space so I left those.4) Fresh prawns in superior stock with tung hoon. Super yummy and tasty! Prawns were fresh and firm. The tung hoon was bouncy and full of flavour like it had absorbed the sauce.5) Abalone - I've had so much abalone the past few weeks at places like Jade, Summer Palace and Szechuan Court repeatedly. This is no worse in quality. Although a slightly smaller size but the other places are more pricey. It was tender and tasty. The sauce was tasty. The broccoli it came with was a bit boring.6) The fish was kinda muddy. We all commented that it was obviously freshwater fish but really the aftertaste was too strong. Disappointing.7) The glutinous fried rice. This was ok only for me. But to be fair, I was really full at this point.8) I enjoyed dessert. Red bean with mandarin peel and a sesame paste glutinous dumpling.I liked that they brought the nian gao straight in the steamers to the table. They had put the fine peanut and icing sugar mixture on the side to serve since one of our group was allergic to nuts. The nian gao was really very smooth and tender and actually stretched a lot when we were picking it up. Usually it would be rolled in the nuts so not their fault. It was quite mild tasting but the texture was really soft."

The skin was super crispy and extremely tasteful. Oh by the way the server wraps the skin onto little egg pancakes. This is their especiality. Very tasteful. We ordered prawn dry chili, whole fish steamed, beef cubes, chicken whole roast, Chinese cabbage for the main dishes. For the appetizers we ordered fried tofu and this was super delicious.

The restaurant is fairly unassuming, in the basement of a fairly unassuming mall (Peninsula Plaza) which is the hangout of the Burmese community in Singapore. (Myanmarese is too long to type..  darn, I just did). Was greeted and seated promptly by the manager. Started with the iced milk tea, which is pretty much the same as what you get in Thai restaurants. It was followed by my favorite Burmese dish, which is the pickled tea leaf salad. You can order it unmixed or premixed. I ordered the premixed non-spicy version, but it was bursting with enough flavor , crunch and textures for the lack of chili to not be noticed. Besides, they had thoughtfully provided some small green chilis on the side, which were not too hot. The next dish was the chicken curry, which was nicely flavored by the base of caramelized onions, and wasn't spicy at all. The meal also came with a side of clear soup, which was mildly spicy and quite tangy. Didn't get around to asking them what it was. Saving it for next time, which there definitely will be."

And straightaway, I told her about wanting to eat Burmese food without much hesitation.Picked her co-worker up and she drove to Peninsula Plaza. Parking was confusing and we ended up going to a carpark lift that has only 2 levels (1st or 6th). We reached the 6th floor after being transported by the lift for a few minutes but it was cool to see the surrounding environments as we sat in the car.There was a parking attendant and she told us that we can only do a daily fare not hourly. And the parking rate per day is $20. She also asked us whether we are ok with it or else we could park somewhere else. My mother insisted to park at Peninsula plaza itself so her co-worker did what was asked.There lifts inside peninsula plaza was confusing. There were 6 lifts but only two can take us to the basement level. We decided to walk out the lobby and take escalator to reach this restaurant instead.We chose a seat that we wanted to have but later on was asked to move and switch to another as they were about to repair the air conditioner. I was browsing the menu and was pretty quick in deciding what to eat as some of the dishes were labeled by three signs (recommended, spicy and very spicy). Like usual, I always go for the chef recommended dishes - Mohinga (noodles) and half a portion of gourd fritters (top up $1.50 more). The dish was very flavorful. Although it doesn't look like the picture (more colorful), it has quite a few ingredients that explode in the tastebuds. My mother tried Shan Khau Hswe. It is like Pad Thai but I still prefer my dish over hers. Her co-worker ordered Myanmar Fried Kway Teow and it was average. The gourd fritters was pretty well cooked. It had golden brown outer layer and was crunchy during bites. I wasn't able to taste the sauce provided.For beverage, tried the Sakyalama. Was pretty good even though it was a fake bird nest drink. But can get too sweet if they pour too much of the red colored syrup (like the case of my mother's co-workers').Overall, even though my mother was kind of disappointed with what she ordered, I was happy with my choice of dish. Service was fast and efficient as well. Will be back to try some other dishes soon."

Was nice and warm, starchy and moist with raisins inside.  My gf pointed out it tastes somewhat like a nonya kueh.Overall, very pleasant ambiance with amazingly abundant seating and reasonable prices. Worth paying a visit especially if you've never had Burmese food before - get the tea leaf salad! ;)One last point: I'm no expert on Burmese food, but when we were there most of the tables around us were Burmese customers, so this place should be pretty authentic."

The fish was really delicious. I don't typically like black bean sauce but it was flavorful while also not being too heavy or gritty (which can happen with black bean sauce). The fish comes to your table over a flame so it's quite hot but it manages not to be overlooked. It's particularly tasty to add other add ons like the bean curd which soak up all of the delicious sauce. I would skip the soup noodles which were fine but nothing to write home about. Like many Singapore restaurants, you order from a tablet at your table so you can easily customize and see how much your bill is going to be. For three people, it was very reasonably priced at 90 Singapore dollars."

As much as it appears to be casual and unpretentious, my partner was once denied entry because he was overly casual that day and had chosen to wear slippers. It was still possible to have a drink on the ground floor where they had a few tables set-up by the pavement, but we couldn't access the rooftop which was our primary reason for being there in the first place. Nevertheless, it remains a nice enough place with a good selection of drinks and food, just make sure you dress appropriately."

It can get quite hot, but most of the time on most nights in Singapore it is pleasantly breezy. There is a one page tapas/bar food list. Most of it is not bad but nothing to shout about. At least they are not exorbitantly priced. The food tends to be not as hot as it should be (we had pizza that came cold), but if you send it back it's alright. Five bottles of beer is $50 here so it's pretty cheap for this part of town. Service is very spotty though. But for the view and the location, it's great.

I've had the steak salad, carbonara and seafood pizzaSteak salad was just.. bearable. Steak was nothing impressive, and salad greens tossed together. Nothing much to be said, other than the fact that I wouldn't recommend. Carbonara with poached egg was the best.. or the better of the three dishes. It was pretty good actually, although I wouldn't say it was an authentic carbonara. A good cream-based pasta.

However I would not recommend the mojito ($12 HH price) - it tasted like sugar water with no alcohol. House Merlot at $11 was pretty good. We had the sea bass and pesto chicken pasta for dinner - both were mediocre (not bad but won't be back to try the same); pesto was a let down as it was too oily and not very flavorful. The fans kept the outdoor area cool and I love the surroundings with a view of the lawn and church.

Service here is terrible and they are not even apologetic that the whole row of fans is ""broken"". Also my friend and I were debating whether our waiter took our order with his phone because he was just looking down and typing away as we spoke. I believe he was but it's just odd and didn't look professional especially at a place this nice (an ipad should have been a better option).We had 2 pasta, one with spicy lobster and the other with vodka sauce. The spicy lobster was actually quite good, but the one with vodka sauce was underwhelming and the smoked salmon too salty.

Very happy they had this as it's a rare find with most restaurants serving plain smoked salmon.  It was presented with a little too much condiments that detracted from the fish. Nonetheless the gravlax was rich and lovely textured.For mains we shared a saddle of lamb stuffed with chestnuts mushroom and pumpkin. They flamed it on site. Very tasty and a good dish. However the fat was not sufficiently rendered and the lamb could have been more tender. Still, a good dish.For dessert I had a fig carpaccio with blueberry and honey comb ice cream. This was very good. Not too sweet and very deep fig flavor flamed with grand marnier. Altogether a fine dinner at a decent price. Value for money but frankly not an epic meal.

I know there are a lot of food and dining options in Singapore, and for a much fairer price, but I was curious to explore other cuisines and restaurants that this wonderful city has to offer. I came here on a Monday evening for dinner, so as you can expect the place was almost completely empty. For those who have never been here, this restaurant is located within the National Gallery, but remains open until a later time.Since it was my first visit here, I was curious to try out their options, and so I decided to get the Chef's Table ($98 SGD) along with the wine pairing ($70 SGD). Some focaccia bread with an olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip were served in the beginning before anything else came out. It tasted simple, and was quite good to nibble on before the main items of our meal came out.The first part of the menu consisted of beef carpaccio and was topped with truffle flakes, cheese, potato crisps, and I think a creme fresh. It was all very tasty, and the flavors mixed appropriately. The truffles were a nice touch as well and didn't take away from the rest of the flavors of the course. The second course was foie gras, and this was perhaps my least favorite course of the entire meal. I may just be biased because foie gras (though a delicacy) just isn't one of my favorite things to eat, and the texture of it is just weird to me. It was prepared elegantly, and served with little bread toasts though, so they tried to make it work, but it just was not for me. It had a very buttery and fatty taste to it, so those who enjoy foie gras may like how it is prepared here. I'm not an expert because it is usually something I avoid, but since it came with the menu, I just tasted it anyways.A sorbet to cleanse the pallet was served before the third course. I had an option to choose from a seared beef tenderloin or the salmon fillet...ultimately, I opted for the beef tenderloin. This was probably my favorite course of the meal. The meat was cooked to a nice medium rare, and was tender and flavorful to the bite. The outside was cooked nicely, but the inside was a beautiful and juicy red. The gravy that topped it added good flavor, and wasn't too overpowering or anything. The accompanying vegetables also gave the course a nice touch.A citrus cheesecake was served for the final dessert course. I am usually not a big fan of cheesecake because I just don't like how heavy it feels and I dislike the creaminess of it. However, I would make an exception for the one that they prepare here. It was a small, but ""just right"" portion so I wasn't left nauseated when I finished it. The citrus flavor really helped to also make the dessert feel light and refreshing instead of too heavy and unpleasant. If it were up to me, it maybe wouldn't be my first choice of dessert, but the way it was prepared, I really can't complain.Overall, this is a decent place to visit for dinner and much different than your local Singaporean cuisine. The service was also fantastic, and very polite and attentive throughout the meal. However, I think that in my opinion, with regards to how much the meal was, and comparing it to other restaurants in the US, this restaurant really is just average. The food was good, but nothing was really a knock out, and there wasn't really anything that would make me want to come back here just for the food. I would probably just recommend this to people who would prefer a nicer and more upscale environment for an evening meal or to celebrate an occasion because the decor and atmosphere of the place is rather nice."

When you do get there however, it's a quiet little nook and rather quaint with the whole old colonial thing going on. I had a large group so I made reservations beforehand and they put us in a separate corner and customized a set lunch menu beforehand for my guests. Service there is top notch, the food also quite decent, but when they ask you for still or sparkling water, learn to say 'tap water' because 'still water' means they give you the fancy mineral sort and I ended up paying S$50 on water along.

We liked the service too, attentive but discreet, knowledgeable without being overbearing. We had:1) Queen Victoria's Green Pea Soup ($18): with a block of sockeye salmon mi cuit, creme fraiche to add creaminess, and lemon to lend a bright accent - loveliest green pea soup I've ever had. Velvety smooth, and amazingly complex, this, together with the next 3 mains, made it to the must-try list.2) Twice Cooked Spanish Suckling Piglet ($46): Skin had a satisfyingly crackling crunch, and the flesh was lusciously fork-tender. This was contrasted with a dollop of caramelised apple compote, toasted grains, radish, and cup of sherry jus.3) Chilli Crab Pasta ($38): with oodles of freshly shredded king crabmeat weaved into a roll of angel hair, and crowned with a gargantuan crab leg, was subtly spiced, redolent of crab essence, was fantastic. 4) Pan Roasted Fillet of Barramundi ($42): incredibly crisp skin and moist flaky meat. This was set on a mashed potato bed, and served with rainbow heirloom tomatoes, rocket leaves, and a drizzling of olive emulsion.5) Grilled Margaret River Wagyu Striploin ($120 500gm for 2 to share): done to a medium-rareness as requested, and sided by a crisp peppery watercress salad and red wine jus - the only weak link of dinner. We didn't like the meat, which we thought too full bodied and this was quite forgettable.We opted for the accompanying sides of a beautifully caramelised casserole of Sweet Potato Dauphinoise ($12 ala carte price but complimentary with the striploin) and Roasted Broccoli ($12 ala carte price) sliced with a flavoursome sesame sauce and decadently plaited with smoked bacon lardons"

The restored black and white surrounded by fairy lights and vegetation offers a beautiful refuge in the middle of town. Locating the restaurant can be a bit of a challenge, so keep a look out for the lit sign indicating the entrance next to the Singapore Philatelic Museum.

As large group birthday dinners go, this is actually one of the more organized/pleasant ones I have been to. The servers were super attentive, even to small details like filling up our water cups, and they went around the table to confirm our orders to prevent any mix-ups before the meal. The actual meal was pretty delicious as well. I had a green pea soup which was very tasty, and I loved it that it was a puree instead of a creamy version. I usually applaud chefs who go through the trouble of puree-ing, and they got the texture nice and smooth which is usually hard to do for peas. The fish we had was pretty good too. In general, the decor was super pretty, with high vaulted ceilings and white colonial pillars everywhere, with fresh flower arrangements. The food came on time, the night pretty much flowed seamlessly, and left a good impression on me. Will be back for a proper more intimate meal next time."

The quality of the food and the preparation is unquestionable, however, I felt a little ripped off as the portions were quite miniscule in my opinion. Considering the amount I'm paying, I expect it to be maybe 30% bigger. That said, service was impeccable on both my visits and there was an improvement in the sizes, so management does take note of diners comments and are willing to change, which is always refreshing."

This was a fantastic meal. We split the lunch set (10 pax).The crispy rice chips were perfectly crisp and paired well with the prawn and chicken. The Tom Yum Soup was very refreshing and mildly spicy. The Chicken Wings and Scallops were also excellent.The Green Curry was nothing special and the Pomfret was too heavily fried - but the desserts (the Tapioca especially) rounded off an excellent meal with great service.

In Asia and I want Asian food but every time I show my diet card, I'm told 'nothing for you here'. We found Shingthai near the top of Purvis St and I was glad we did. The menu says to check with staff over dietary requirements so I did, gave my order and was told that was ok. I had the spicy beef salad and the pineapple rice with pork and prawns. Both were stellar dishes. Lovely medium cooked slices of beef and they didn't stint on the beef either. The pineapple rice was fab too - beautifully flavoured with a great balance of sweet and savoury.I'll be honest and admit I didn't pay much attention to the decor and didn't use the toilets. Food came fairly quickly so once that was on the table, we all munched away. The meals come when ready so not starter then main style but that was fine for us.We were $40 sing for starter and main and a drink. Portions are pretty large per person and many dishes can be made to share too. Well worth a visit and as a gluten free person, a fab meal that was safe for me :-)"

Whilst the stuffed chicken wings seem to be the house's speciality, it was the red duck curry, fresh papaya salad, strip-steak salad that were my personal favourites. The strip-steak salad actually comprises excellently grilled steak, rather than the dry, chewy, beef you're often treated to in many Asian cuisines.The staff were very busy, as the restaurant is quite popular on a Saturday, but still managed to provide prompt service with a smile.The one thing I will warn of though, and this is by no means a negative, is that when a dish is typically served with chilli in Thailand, expect it to be close to as hot as the Thais like it.For my wife, this was a step too hot, but for me, I loved it.In Australia we're used to ""white person"" hot where the dishes have a mild kick and it was a (somewhat welcome) surprise to have some face-melting chilli in the mix. If you're sensitive to heat, ask them to tone it down a notch. I also assume this is why locals order more modest (aka bland) dishes and we were the only ones with interesting looking food on our plates.One last little trinket if you've made it this far: avoid the glutinous rice and durian. It's served like porridge and unless you really REALLY like durian (and that sort of rice + custard + fruit style) avoid it and order something else. It's not often I'm smiling at the end of a meal. I think this may be my favourite Singaporean meal, if not one of my favourites ever."

We started with some thai standards - the fish cake, thai papaya salad, Tom yum kung, pandan chicken and their famous stuffed chicken wings. Having eaten loads of thai food in the past, I have to say that the starters were good. I especially enjoyed the pandan chicken dish and the stuffed chicken wing. They had different dipping sauce with the different starters which allowed us to do a bit of mix and match. The stuffed chicken wing was unique - chicken meat stuffed back into the wing and fried. The pandan chicken was very well done and had a good sauce to accompany. The tom yum was also well done - clear broth with loads of lemongrass and packs a nice punch. We followed with a fried grouper, roast duck red curry and stif  fried Kang Kung. All very well done - the fried grouper came with a sweet spicy accent and the roast duck red curry was yummy & mildly spicy. All goes well with a bowl of rice. We ended with the tup tim krob and the mun chium. We love the tup tim krob but have been frequently disappointed - it was surprisingly good here. Itis a coconut broth filled with the 'red rubies' (pieces of chestnut soaked in some syrup n covered with a layer of red colouring) and slices of jackfruit & coconut.

The rendition of the Tom Yum Soup here is clear and tangy as compared to the red and creamy one that is served at other restaurants. The clear broth is very palatable but a tad too spicy. The fresh and succulent prawns in the soup make up for it though. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice too, which was delightfully fragrant and flavorsome. The pineapple, egg and prawns in the rice all contributed to the aroma, while the pork floss on top completed the dish. All in all, a pleasant experience and I would patronize this restaurant again to satisfy any Thai food cravings."

Bf's foodie friend recommended it, so how can it go wrong.. Haha. I'm not sure about pricing though, didn't see too much of the menu. Might be a little on the higher side, I'm guessing. Pretty nice ambiance, nice cushy red decor on the walls, servers dressed in bright red/pink colours.We had:1. Iced lemongrass pandan drink ($3.50) - nice and refreshing!2. Tom yum clear soup ($7 per bowl, I believe) - our friend said to order it clear if we didn't want too much spice, else it'd come with quite some amt of chilli oil and could be pretty spicy!3. Pomelo salad - mm! yum. Interesting that there was a bit of char-grilled something in it. 4. Khao Tang Nah Tang - rice cracker with minced chicken coconut curry type dip - delicious! Rice cracker on its own tasted like one of those Want Want rice crackers, so that alone was pretty good. But when you spoon the dip on.. Mm! Comfort food!!5. Signature fried fish - indeed, as our foodie friend described, dry fried outside but still moist and flaky inside, with delicious mango sauce to go along!6. Green chicken curry - mm! my favourite. tender chicken, 7. Red beef curry - pretty good too, actually. Good textured beef, bamboo shoots, mm![both curries had these tiny ball-like pea eggplants in them, very cute! slightly bitter. also these larger rounder Thai eggplants which somewhat resemble tomatos on the inside]8. Thai fish cake - came with delicious plum sauce!9. Pandan chicken - very juicy and well grilled! Also came with dark soy sesame sauce of some sort10. Olive rice - SO GOOD. I hadn't had olive rice before, but this has converted me. I normally shun olives. There was some sort of waxed chicken or something that came with it, pretty interesting.. somewhat sweet.11. Seafood fried rice - can definitely taste the oil, but sinfully yummy. Quite a bit of seafood too! crab, prawn, squid, etc12. Stuffed chicken wing - our foodie friend said these are the BEST stuffed chicken wings he's ever had, and I have to agree. Bursting with flavour (again, very juicy chicken, mushroom, asparagus - which stuffed chicken wing has asparagus?!) and well fried!13. Mixed veges - normal oyster sauce veg, yay for lotus root. Quite a mix of veg but nothing spectacular, just standard veges. cauliflower; broccoli; asparagus; carrots; snow peas...I stole some of my bf's durian glutinous rice - it was somewhat surprising though, came in kind of a porridge type sauce. Not really what I expected - I thought the normal was durian on the side and glutinous rice, the way mango and sticky rice is served. Foodie friend's staple is red ruby, which I would've loved to try, but could not stuff another morsel down!"

There are only two choices of ice cream. You can also request for just ice cream in a cup which was what we did. The honey and fig ice cream was delicious and at $2. it was quite a steal in the city center area. It will be $3.50 for the ice cream in the petit croissant.

But during my week long stay, I am not a fan of the overall food quality nor the overall service.The layout is cramped and can get very loud around lunch time. Some of the seating area is caked with dust, and it stayed that way my entire trip. The food isn't very fresh, or at least half of the time. The baked goods in particular show this. During my stay, I ordered from them a raisin bun, kouign amann, berry tarte, petit antoine, canele, paris brest. Half of those were either stale or dried out. The service leaves more to be desired. Sometimes they're always around, and sometimes they're nowhere to be found. It takes FOREVER to get the check, so long that I regret not ordering takeout. They don't like to take dirty plates away, and instead just leave them on your table. I ordered a croque monsieur and a sunny-side-up egg on top (hence making a croque madame), and they just didn't understand the combination!! 10 minutes later, I received a salmon quiche. I tell them that's not what I ordered, and they ask ""would you like to keep it?"" Yeah No! They have calorie bombs, such as their pancake breakfast sandwich/burger with tater tots, and yet they also have healthier alternatives, such as juices and salads. So on the bright side, the servers & manager are super friendly, and the coffee is made well. I recommend their coffees and their raisin bun. For better quality, I recommend Gastronomia Di Paolo down the hall."

It's served in an espresso shot glass thingy, complete with great latte art. I found it pricey for $5, but it tasted awesome.Great place to have a meeting, as there's a fountain in the middle that always shoots water randomly.

I try not to eat too many carbs but this bakery remains one of my peccadilloes. They are vying for first place for best croissants (plain, almond, chocolate-almond) in Singapore. The kouign amman is justifiably famous-- it's a buttery, carmelized, salty-sweet gooey bunch of deliciousness. Have that with a cup of the really good coffee and you've made a damn fine start (or end!) to your day.  The baguettes are also up there at best-in-Singapore level so take one of those home with you. Most of the baked goods are delicious with the exception of the brioche which, as a previous reviewer mentioned, is dry and makes you kick yourself for not ordering the kouign amman you had your eye on to begin with. I was in Orchard yesterday and saw a new outlet in Tang's. That makes me happy. Two suggestions for the owners:  1) please get rid of those awful pencil-legged tables at the Raffles City outlet and 2) keep it real--don't let the success go to your head!"

But I doubt it will be the same eating in the shop unless they are straight out the oven.  However, I think their Almond croissant with Chocolate filling (left) and Kouig Aman (right) are equally competent , if not better than its croissant if you prefer something sweet. Both flaky and fragrant, the almond croissant was heavenly while the latter, despite its ugly appearance, was swirled with salted caramel remains my personal favourite. If you don't like chocolate, do try the Plain Almond Croissant. It was consumed at room temperature but remained crispy.However, some of the pastries left me in a blur. The Raisin Roll (right) was average while the Pandan Flan (Bottom Left) lacked any distinct pandan aroma or flavour and the pastry was soggy. Meanwhile, The Rapsberry Crumble (Top Left) was underbaked resulting in a slightly chewy lacklustre pastry and the crumble toppings were too little.  Just as I thought there would be no new items anymore, it's Christmas specials- A Chocolate Snowball Globe tart took me by surprise. Filled with sweet milk chocolate mousse and the tangy pineapple and passionfruit compote, the chocolate ball sat on a crumbly almond tart whose sweetness was just right.At the centre sits a mini delicate red balloon of salty raspberry sauce which burst open at the poke of a fork. This is not something new but still very interesting to have in local bakeries."

Once out of the lift, turn to your left & then left again. The restaurant is right at the end.There are a few branches, including one at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), so you can go to any one that's convenient. It is advisable to make reservations, especially for large groups, before going down as the queues (esp for dinner) can get a bit long. You will initially be given 2 menus, one for set meals, and the other for ala carte. Most people order from the ala carte menu so they can pick and choose their dishes. At the end of the meal, you will be presented with a dessert menu. In the middle of each table is Putien's famous chilli which blends multiple ingredients together for its wonderful spicy flavour. It's a tasty accompaniment with any of the dishes, besides the dessert of course. Most of their dishes come in 3 sizes; small for 1-2 persons, medium for 3-4 persons, and large for 5-6 persons. Their Heng Hwa Bee Hoon is a dry stir fried bee hoon (vermicelli) with sliced dried bean curd (tau pok), sliced pork, peanuts, and lala (mini clams). The Putien Ca Fen is like a soupy version of the Heng Hwa bee hoon. The stir fried pork & onion strips with fried mantou buns is a must try for those who love mantou buns or pork. You will be provided a small plate with neatly folded 2cm by 2cm mini triangles of plastic gloves which you can use to hold the bun in one hand while you fill it up with the pork & onions before delivering the package to your mouth without having your hands dirty in the process. The lychee sweet & sour pork is nicely cooked and not hard & dry with about 2 lychees & some capsicum peppers. I usually dip this with the chilli to give it an added zing to the flavour. This restaurant is a good place for a family meal or with friends. There are wooden baby chairs available upon request."

The last time I saw a bowlful of cockles at another restaurant, I hated the taste of it. But after a few friends keep raving about the cockles in Putien, I just have to try it. No regrets. If you dislike cockles because of the bloody or metallic taste, you may like the version here. I do not know how they do it, but the cockles are already cooked and are not rubbery at all. There is no metallic aftertaste either. Instead the cockles are sweet and garlicky (if you take one covered with garlic) and a bit spicy (if you get one with cut chili on it). They are simply delicious. That is the highlight for me.I always like the Henghwa bee hoon and this branch's quality remains the same. It is even better when paired with the house chili. The chili is a bit sour spicy, and you can buy a bottle home too. The other dishes we had - spicy clams, fried eggplant with pork floss and duck with yam - were also nice but not that memorable. The or nee (yam paste) was too thick and not good at all. Skip this if you are a big or nee fan, you will be disappointed. I know I will be back for more drunken cockles and the noodles."

The cauliflower appetizer with purple mustard and a strip of bacon came together nicely and the flavors complimented each other well - the mild sweetness of the cauliflower with the smoky saltiness of the bacon and bitterness of the mustard. Chocolate ice cream came with creme anglaise and three segments of mandarin.

Located in the middle of the shophouses, next to its sister restaurant Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar, another equally well known restaurant. Although the restaurant is quite high end with its equally expensive priced menu, it offers quite a reasonable priced 3 course lunch set at $38++ which is available on weekday.The restaurant is decorated in grey with paintings and dim lights around which gives an elegant setting. Besides the usual menu, the staff also make his offers on what is in season by using a ""daily special cart"". Today there is vegetables from Japan, lamb, wagyu beef, and assorted seafood such king crab, scallop. But the one which holds everyone's attention is the truffle. Even when covers in a glass cover, one can easily smells the earthy pungent smell.Before starting the meal, one is served with hot towel to wipe with. One is served with a pipping warm mini buguette and butter to start the meal. Though the bread looks hard, it is quite crispy and soft to texture.For today's lunch set, there is 3 choices for starter : Farmer's salad, Clear vegetable soup, and Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up egg. Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up eggThe mushroom is quite well flavoured.Next is the main which also comes with 3 choices : Gunther's Creation (seafood pasta), Braised lamb stew, Leffe beer, and Charcoal grilled Wagyu steak (additional S$20++).Cold Angel hair pasta, Oscietra caviar ($60++)However I decide to go with the staff's recommendation to topup $40++ more to change the main course to the restaurant's signature cold pasta dish. It is quite popular which could be found in most tables. Refreshing cold and smells great of truffle which makes one high before eating.The last course is the dessert which also comes with 3 choices : Dessert of the Day (Pineapple Panna Cotta), Cheese Platter (additional S$10++), and Fine apple tart ""à la dragées"", Havana rum raisin ice cream (additional S$8++).Fine apple tart ""à la dragées"", Havana rum raisin ice cream ($25++)The apple tart is different from the traditional apple tart. It looks more like a flat pizza. Thin slices of soft caramelised apple on a very thin base. Crunchy and crispy on the outside. The ice cream is rich and creamy. Pairing the cold ice cream and the warm apple tart together is quite a yummy combination.Lastly there is coffee or tea and Petit fours to end the meal with.The coffee is quite rich with a slight bitter and chocolaty taste. I have it with just milk and without sugar. It is just nice to balance with the sweetness from the dessert and petit fours. The petit fours consists of Financier, Canele, Wafer and chocolate. I like the canel, which has a soft and tender custard center with a dark, thick caramelized crust.Overall the food is quite delicious. The place is packed even it is a weekday lunch time. Although the restaurant is busy, its Chef Gunther still make an effort to visit the tables."

We weren't disappointed, and their signature caviar pasta still lingers in my palette and memory days after our visit. But I'm not sure if it justified the high price tag ($880 for 3 pax). D and I thought it was a bit pricey for its location and mundane decor (small room with not much decor and no view) and were a bit annoyed that it only offered one set menu or nothing at all and having to go a la carte, as we like the surprises of set courses in fine dining. In comparison, Les Amis offers courses in the range of $150~250 and Jaan $190~$299, which also has sophisticated and lovely decor and an amazing view, respectively, as an added plus.Service was great as always, and every dish was delish (with an exception to truffle that we thought lacked much flavor) so no regrets. But not sure if we'd return again."

Gunther's *modern french* dining certainly lives up to its name. I had Gunther's when it first opened a long time ago & i'm glad to be back again tonight. Signature dishes:Angel hair pasta with caviar. Back then this signature dish was all the rage and it still tastes just as good. Light & heavy flavors at the same time to match perfectly with a nice champagne.The foie gras with crushed almonds & hibiscus sauce is a classic & it's return to the menu is a welcome return. Again, light & heavy flavors will match with a nice burgundy or red. Apple tart is not in the photos i uploaded but it is another must try dish. Light flaky crunchy crust matches very well with a light apple filling that won't overwhelm your stomach but is a very welcome end to one's meal & palette. Today's dishes that i had that were memorable... actually they were all great!Onion cheese gratin - a very french influenced dish using onion, the texture & sweetness of the onion is brought out nicely. Langoustine meuniere - full of prawn flavor yet it is very very light. It is sliced very thinly so the gamey taste of raw prawn is not overpowering but its sweetness is brought out, nicely balanced with the cream & caviar.Carabinero gambas prawn - Gunther's is very capable to do a sharing portion for 2 tonight. The 2 spoonfuls of tomato & slightly spicy rice is full of flavor. The prawn is cooked just right with some tasty roe. It's head & brains is cooked to perfection! Pork Belly & Coquille Pasta - Very large portions for sharing. The pork belly is very fulfilling, comforting & satisfying to one's belly. The sauce would match well with a margaux or burgundy! I was feeling very full at this point BUT dessert beckons!For dessert, crepe suzette that was also shared between me & my guest. Gunther's staff will put on a nice show to flambe the crepe's in front of you. The orange sauce is tangy served with an equally tasy ice cream & light crepes that is nicely burnt in a few places. Ambience:Gunther's decor is very simple but its ambience is quite quiet & there are not many tables that adds to the exclusivity of dining here. This is a nice place for a romantic dinner for two.Price: Special's & seasonal items can be quite expensive but given that gunther's is willing to do sharing portions & some dishes are large portions, at least one's belly will not go hungry after the meal. As always, lunch is the best time to go for value for money. Monday's & tuesday are corkage free which adds tremendously to gunther's value. Service:The ratio of servers to each table is approximately 1 to 1-2 tables depending on how booked Gunther's is. Every staff is friendly and willing to explain anything. I recommend Mogish who is a long time staff to take good care you. Overall: Gunther's has been fabulous. My guest was equally delighted. Each dish is a nice gastronomical surprise & a nice refresh of memories from my first dining experience at gunther's. I will return soon! Thanks chef & team!!!"

The name just keep on coming across my ears for years; but for some reason, I just never ended up there. We're not completely sure what made us go there, but we decided to go there to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.I had the truffle soup for my starter and it was up to standard. It was creatively served with pumpkin veloute; I think they match well. Le wife had ""Floating island of champignons de Paris"" which is basically consomme, with thinly sliced mushrooms. It was disappointing tbh. The dish was completely lacking and just too plain.The second course was the star of the night. I had the scampi carpaccio, cream, caviar and it just blew my mind. I'm a fan of a simple-dish-done-well and this dish was executed to perfection. The ingredients were fresh and the cream compliments the caviar perfectly without overpowering it. Le wife had what I think was their signature dish, the cold angel hair with caviar. It's not a unique dish, but again, the execution was spot on.The third dish was decent. I'm a big fan of prawn so I decided to go for the carabinero gambas, which is basically those red prawns from the Mediterranean Sea. It was not the best one that I've ever had, but it was still ok. It was slightly overcooked for me, and there was some tomato risotto that just felt out of place. Le wife had bamboo clam with black truffle.The main course was another dish that I love. We shared the roasted rack of pata negra pig. At first bites, I thought it was just a mediocre pork chop. But the after taste of the pork was just superb, I feel like this is a very deep and mature dish that you just can't stop eating. Heck, I even took 1/2 of my wife's pork!The dessert was also great. We shared the apple tart a la dragees. It's a very thin and crispy apple pie. It was a little bit too sweet to my taste, but it didn't stop me from finishing them.Overall, I'd definitely be back to Gunther's. I heard they have a great lunch deal but even without it, a future visit to Gunther's is imminent."

The pasta was cooked to al dente and seasoned generously with truffle oil, and finally topped with Oscietra Caviar. The amazing flavor of the seasoning coupled with the bounciness of the pasta made it a satisfying dish. For dessert, the Canele from the Petit four was outstanding.

The asparagus was cooked perfectly with just the right crunch.Oven roasted cod, béarnaise sauce - I found it is just OK, average the most. The Tempura vegetables lack the crispness and off the fryer freshness. Dessert of the Day - Earl Grey Pudding - which is really really good! Light, Smooth and with just the right amount of sweetness!Followed by Petite Four and ended with a cappuccino.The Chef also gave me a taste of their Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar - All I can say is CAVIAR! This suppose to be their signature appetizer and I have to say it is Excellent!! Refreshing and light and  Truffle Oil!! CAVIAR!!Services is attentive and professional. Great Food! Great Value! Lunch Specials ROCKS!"

The elegant ambience of the restaurant and exemplary service makes you feel pampered, while the good fare feels like a treat. The restaurant is located at the central area of City Hall and Bugis, which is accessible and convenient. This restaurant has merited positive reviews for its angel hair pasta, so I had to try one of those. I ordered the Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar and was not disappointed. The pasta was cooked to al dente and seasoned generously with truffle oil, and finally topped with Oscietra Caviar. The amazing flavor of the seasoning coupled with the bounciness of the pasta made it a satisfying dish. For dessert, the Canele from the Petit four was outstanding. It is a bite-sized snack in perfect proportions, and is crispy on the outside and chewy inside; a good finale to the meal."

It's a bit misleading and looks tiny from outside but once you go in you see multiple dining rooms with socially distant seating in keeping with the times. We went for lunch and ordered ala carte but they have multiple set menus to choose from as well. The standard set menu is a bit limited though and would recommend just ordering ala carte if you have a particular pasta you prefer. We ordered the bufala mozzarella with cherrr tomato as started which was decent. For mains we got the linguine with crab - was excellent and the Gar-bonara their take on the Italian classic which was creamy delicious! Dessert was tiramisu and was done very well, though I didn't see any lady's fingers in our portion. Wine list is extensive but pretty pricey even by Singapore standards especially if you are getting just a glass. That said the pour is very generous. Would recommend this establishment highly if you are celebrating an occasion or you really like Italian food!"

Our waiter introduced us to the set-menu, five courses with coffee, all truffle-themed for 188 S$ per person. It sounded great but we did not want to eat all that much - and spend a little less on dinner.We decided to go with half a dozen oysters (Australia & NZ), shared a scallop/white truffles pasta starter and had pan roasted sea bass with vegetables as main.The food was delicious, the oysters fresh and very tasty, the pasta with scallops cooked to perfection and with the fresh truffle shavings just divine.The fish had a nice crispy skin and the meat was just perfect both in terms of texture and flavour.We had chosen a Sauvignon blanc/Semillon from Australia to go with the food, which was lovely and at 88 S$ one of the cheapest choices on the extensive and expensive wine list. We found that the wine in general was overpriced but since we hadn't splurged on food for some time we decided to treat us to it - this however being the reason for 4 stars instead of five, as it really blew us away.Service was very good and professional, and consistent throughout which has become somewhat of a rarity these days, unfortunately.This place is perfect if a celebration is in order - actually there were two local parties celebrating a birthday complete with cake and candles :-).We will certainly be back some day for their excellent Italian food (the executive chef is Italian) and perfect service."

Having the dish on your own would be too rich for most people. Classical dishes like osso bucco and veal milanesa are prepared to perfection here; the former melts in your mouth, the latter is juicy with very light 'batter'.

I tried 2 dishes there, both of which I am very satisfied with - Osso Buco Con Risotto (braised veal shank with saffron risotto) and Linguine with Crabmeat and Vodka Sauce. The spaghetti was marvelous, proving the high standards of this Italian restaurant as the pasta was cooked to al dente and tossed in a flavorsome tomato-based sauce with a touch of alcohol. The Osso Buco Con Risotto stole the show, with the braised veal shank so tender and succulent. The creamy and rich risotto perfectly complemented the savory veal. The standards of this restaurant are heightened by its impeccable service. The staff was warm and friendly, and not to say attentive and accommodating when taking our orders."

The crackling pork was also wonderful.  Portions are small, but that's normal for high end European dining. Impressive wine list.  But - it's expensive, as the other reviewers note.

Reasonable portions but prices accordingly to the mall air conditioning setting. The person that took our order is knowledgeable to the local taste and will prompt what variations of hot beverages I wanted. You have to wait for your seat even though there's empty tables. But you have to order and pay in advance at the cashier. Menus are on each table or will be brought to you. They accept various credit cards, NETS and cash. You will be given a beeper and will ring when your order is ready to be collected at the ""Take Makan"" sign, which literally mean take your food. We tried the usual local dishes: Nasi Lemak with Tom Yum flavor chick leg (latter is nothing usual), seafood Lor Mee, Roasted chicken wings (you can order in twos, fours or sixes), mushroom soup and the garlic bread and a cup of Yuan Yang. (Coffee and tea mixed)Nasi Lemak is rather ordinary. The Lor Mee was tasty. The rest are pretty ordinary as well. The Yuan Yang was made by the cashier who asked if I preferred more or less sweet - that's nice. Other than walking up to the cashier to place and pay for your order and collecting the food. That pretty much it.. enjoy your food and leave when you are ready. The service staff will clear your table and get ready for the next customers. The restaurant is not that crowded on a weekend evening because there are lots of restaurants in this newly opened Funan Mall. Lots to try there..."

The 2nd time was dinner with my friend from San Francisco on a Friday evening. My friend had the Prawn Laksa which looked really good. I would try this dish one of these days. I, on the other hand, had the Signature Angus Beef Noodle. My beef noodle was very good with a light herbal taste soup. For dessert, I had the durian crème brûlée. Personally, I love crème brûlée in its original form. I am never into green tea crème brûlée, coffee crème brûlée or any other versions of my favorite dessert. The durian crème brûlée had the right consistency with a more intense flavor. For durian lovers, I am sure they would really enjoy this durian crème brûlée. For me, the dessert was good. I highly recommend to anyone who likes durian. The staff from my first visit remembered what I had previously. I asked him when the restaurant going to offer the breakfast menu, particularly mee siam. He went to check and told me it would be this coming weekend. He was so sweet to bring an extra chair for my Louis and also gave us pandan macarons on the house. Merci Ben! :)Note: The breakfast menu is available only on weekends. My 3rd visit was this morning. Waking up at 7.45am for a bowl of mee siam with my sister for breakfast at JustIN? Sure, no problem!! :D Nothing going to dampen my mood this morning even when it was raining outside. FOOD 5/5My sis and I each had the Singapore Breakfast set ($20) which comprised of a fresh fruit juice, a bowl of mee siam and a cup of Vittoria coffee. Signature House-made Mee Siam with Egg and Live Prawns - The portion was perfect for breakfast. One could order this Ala carte at $10 which to me is inexpensive. My sis felt the mee siam was a bit too tangy for her taste. I agreed but I do like it though. Chicken Porridge - We also ordered the Chicken Porridge. It was really tasty!!Gula Java Ice cream - told my sis about the Gula Java ice cream and at the end of the meal, I asked if we could order a scoop of Gula Java ice cream. We both shared the ice cream and I wonder if the restaurant made this ice cream in house. So gooooddd!! Mmmm..AMBIENCE 5/5I like the ambience. I finally saw a floor sign next to the door which indicates the main entrance. The entrance is really confusing. I saw some people coming in from the ""back door"" while I was there. However, if it rains, it would be terrible to use the main door leading to outside along the sidewalk with no shelter. SERVICE 5/5I have no complaints about the service. Staffs were friendly and attentive. When I got back not long ago, I saw the receipt and realized they charged one breakfast set less. I called up the restaurant and let them know they charged me less and I would swing by soon to pay for the set. I guess initially the manager thought they charged me more, I like no no you guys charged me less and I have to pay for that 2nd breakfast set. Guess I have to make a trip next couple of days to pay, hehe!!"

They make their own caramel sauce which they put on their sweet crepes and also sell pots of them. I had a simple ham and cheese crepe. And for dessert i had a chocolate and banana crepe. The chocolate was home made and it came with homemade ice cream. Both of my options were simple and decent. Not sure if they are a bang for your buck, as i feel ive had better crepe options. I could have had a small green salad with the crepe and a bit more filling. My friend ordered the French onion soup, which was nothing special. the cheese wasnt grilled on top  Another friend tried their speciality crepe with the Salted caramel sauce.  it was good and different.  not overky sweet. overall was nice to try it out.

My husband and I walked around the area a couple of times to find this place. Google maps was not that helpful and directed us somewhere else. We got to the shop a bit late, but was able to order the Crepe with Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream. It was my first time getting crepe and the fillings separately. The crepe was flat on the plate with a small dish of ice cream next to it. I was in for a bit of shock when I first saw it, but I realized that if you have the fillings separated from the crepe the crepe would taste much better and it would not become soggy. So we would cut pieces of the crepe out one at a time and place a small portion of the ice cream right on top and pick the crepe up and enjoy. The taste was amazing, where the crepe is still a bit warm and the ice cream is still cold. The crepe was also slightly sweetened but I did also tasted a tiny bit of saltiness (it could have been from the ice cream as well). The blend of both ice cream and crepe was wonderful. I would love to stop by this small shop, if we have the time."

I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the crepes tasted (and buckwheat no less).  Came on a Sunday and despite it being close to a full house, the 1 server and 1 cook managed shockingly well. When I am craving crepes this will be where I will look to first. The bad:  Decor needs a huge overhaul. Tables, chairs, art, it all needs to be revamped. The ""booth"" seating is just a run of small padding on a 90 degree plastic bench. Incredibly uncomfortable to sit on. The walls were sparse which not only looks bad but it bounces sounds and makes for an amplified chamber of chatter. I could easily, and unwillingly, hear every conversation from every table. On that day there was a couple breaking up, an infant smacking a spoon repeatedly on the table, a family on vacation and a handful of locals talking about Thailand. See, that was annoying just to read, imagine listening to that for a whole meal. The ugly: Doesn't pull off the quaint mom and pop vibe although the staff makes me suspect they are. If so, make it more homey, if not, pour some money into making it higher end. Prices are too high, but I didn't mind so much considering the food was good.  But at the end of the day should anyone pay $20+ for a crepe?"

Happy Hour Special: 1 for 1 drinks 5-7pm on weekdays :) Fandango has lots of options for their happy hour special, compared to the neighboring restaurants/bars in Chijmes that only have beer and wine. So I was sold when they listed what they had and said Sangria.A (somewhat) healthy drink, hey there's fruit!! after a long day at work sounds like the perfect idea! Luckily, we arrived at 6:50pm and had 10 minutes to order before the deals were over. I ordered two different sangrias, which is great because most 1 for 1 specials only allow you to get the same exact drink. The sangrias were exotic tasting with fresh fruit, it was thirst-quenching and delicious!!! I apologize, I can't recall the names of the drinks, but I think they were the last two in the Sangria section.My friends ordered Hoeegarden and Stella Artois, and they definitely did not skimp on the beer either! Their drinks came in huge mugs/glasses and was definitely worth it.We ordered the Wasabi Prawns - which is pretty Singaporean dish apparently. I was afraid that there would be a lot of wasabi, because I can't handle too much of it. But, there was just the perfect amount of wasabi, and it was also drizzled with a bit of mayonnaise. What an interesting, tasty combo! The prawns were perfectly crunchy and so good that I even at the tails! The prawns were about $16 (which is still a bit pricey for tapas, thus the 4-stars).I would definitely come back to Chijmes and try more of their yummy tapas! And, some more sangria too :)"

Needless to say i'm a huge fan of Spanish tapas. I recently checked out Fandango Tapas and Wine Bar and enjoyed dining privileges using the Palate card. Located in the heart of Chijmes, Fandango provides a chic yet comfortable place to relax and unwind in the al fresco seating area facing the lawn and the beautiful church. Thankfully, the weather was on our side for some outdoors dining.I was a little disappointed as our Sangrias were a little diluted. The red wine based ones were stronger though.Serrano and Manchego ($18) is a good snack to have with some wine. Another option is the Deep Fried Camembert ($17) served with raspberry and Cabernet coulis. I liked the texture of the oozy cheese but the coulis was lacking in texture and too watery for my liking.The Albondigas ($14), a traditional beef meatballs in a spicy tomato and rosemary sauce was probably my favorite dish of the night. They were juicy, flavorful and simply divine.The Tortilla a la Espanola ($11) is a classic Spanish potato and onion omelette. It's so hard to find a good one in Singapore and it's really not that easy to make one. Fandango's tortilla kept me going on and on the whole night with its soft potatoes and light onion fragrance. It's good alone but the tangy tomato picante was good with it too.The Paella de Marisco ($35) wasn't the most traditional that i've tasted. For one, the short grained rice was a little too fluffy for a paella. I was told by Emma, the friendly boss, that it's a spanish grain, though not bomba. Texture aside, i liked the rich seafood broth taste in this one and the seafood were fresh.Desserts were kinda disappointing for us. Our Chocolate lava cake was overdone the first time round. Despite the molten centre in the second, the chocolate taste was lacking. Ice cream was so so as well.The signature tiramisu was sorely lacking in espresso and alcohol. It was all cream and frozen chocolate swirls all around. I say skip desserts and stick to the wine and tapas."

Soup Spoon is pretty much an institution now and can be found in many parts of Singapore. I do like the soup and usually get the pre-packed soup for the weekend. You can also order the fresh soup to go, just remember to ask for butter with your bun. Another favorite thing to order is the iced lemon tea which is freshly made. None of those pre-mix powder drink which has a certain taste to it. I have not tried anything from Soup Broth Asia since the merger. Before that, the Asian soup I tried was ok, nothing too special about it.I had good memories of the burgers from The Handburger before it was unionized. The burgers were juicy and decent sized. The highlight was the milkshake which was thick and rich. During my recent visit, I order The Works burger which basically had everything - bacon, fried egg, onion rings, slice of cheese and beef patty. It was good but it was also cold. I was not sure if it was because I was talking away and the food got cold or if the air conditioning was so strong that the food turned cool fast or the food came very lukewarm and so turned cold by the time I ate it. However it happened, cold food was just not very enjoyable. The prices seemed to have dropped too. My burger set was just $14.90, a steal as it came with a choice of drink and side. I chose the cake of the day, a misnomer as you get to select from 4 options. The lemon drizzle cake was good but a bit dry for me. My friend liked it that way though. This is a good place for those who like plenty of options or a group of people who has different dining preferences. The current low prices also help. There are tables which can be joined together accommodate big groups. And yay! They finally accept credit card - PayWave FTW!"

The falafel was dry on its own, and the quinoa didn't taste right either - it should be a little nutty.

Lunch on a weekday wasn't bad; there were people but a decent amount of seating to choose from.As the name suggests, this is union of a few different concepts: noodles, burgers, and soup. You order at the cashier first and they'll give you a tracking device. I say this because it looks like a buzzer. However, instead of it vibrating to alert you to retrieve your order, somehow a server whom you've never seen in your life will just find where you're sitting and deliver your food. Creepy efficiency!For my maiden voyage here, I chose the Handburger stall. I ordered the THB original, which is basically your typical cheeseburger. If you make it a meal, you can choose from a variety of sides, but I stuck with fries. I liked how there was (what I assume to be) an onion relish on my cheese; the sweetness balanced out the savoury perfectly. I also noticed that the lettuce and tomato were underneath the beef patty, which helped in preventing the bottom bun from getting soggy. The fries were served with a sauce that didn't taste like ketchup; instead it had the consistency of a sweet and sour sauce. It was good, though.Not sure why, but it costs $3 more to get a stuffed portobello burger than a meat burger, so vegetarians, you might have to pay a little more. :( But other than that, the service was amazingly quick and I enjoyed my food. Yay! I'm a fan."

At the Raffles City Outlet, they sell the same thing as the other Soup Spoon outlets. Just what makes me keep going back even though there is nothing different from the other outlets? Firstly, if I'm looking for something relatively healthy and filling, this place is it. So for those who are feeling guilty about munching fried food all the time and cringe at the thought of splurging $8-$22 for a bowl of vegetables, stick to the tastier option of Soup Spoon. Secondly, it's their Soup Specials.. every month or so, Soup Spoon brings in 3 special soups that are not on their main menu. They had french onion soup, miso seafood soup, broccoli and cheese soup etc... something uniquely different from the usual every month, so if I keep running back, it's because I know the soup I like from the unique menu, will be gone after a certain time period. Of course, if the regular souperholics whine enough, the popular special soup will be placed on the regular menus.. like the Simon and Garfunkle Ragout Stew."

Never gets hungry, the floor below the ground is always flooded with lunch crowds & tourists when the clock stroke noon. Just as I get bored by the same shrews of eateries waving at me each day, I whiffed some beautiful floral scent that intrigued me last week.I was lured by the scent, and then by the colorful blossom stood in front of me and then I realized the wordings on the card pinned on the leaves that reads, ""Congratulation on the opening of The Soup Spoon UNION..."" The logo was quite a success in translating the new message ""UNION"", I'd thought it was a new member to the basement. Upon studying it, it is effectively a unification of the 3 food brands under the same F&B group. UNION now housed the well-known soup joint: The Soup Spoon (TSS), Asia Broth Noodle Bar(ABN) & The Handburger (THB) in a larger unit compound. The 3 eateries are not new to the mall, each exists at the basement for quite a while with the Asia Broth Noodle Bar being the last to join.The new layout has a clean canteen look with sturdy wooden tables and movable metal chairs and a sofa bench. A few apron-clad personnel will bring you the food when it's ready except for the soup when it's readily available. The staff are polite and prompt in table clearing - the service is generally good.Menu is available on each table. Just find your own seats and get to the respective counters for your orders. There's no cross-ordering; you can't order for a THB dessert at TSS when u wanted a soup to go along. Queue separately. TSS has their own payment counter at the stall, but to pay for THB or ABN purchases, you need to queue at another standalone cash register adjacent to it. The whole concept hasn't been fully unionized if it appears that manner.Comes to food, I opted for a value super meal from TSS that sounds a better deal. I got a soup and my half salad and drink by topping up a $4.90. An additional bread roll for $0.70 since I had a large Beef Goulash to share.The Beef Goulash is a thick tomato broth with slightly stiff beef chunks, shitake mushrooms, potato morsels, red/green capsicum wedges, dissolving celery bits. Lightly seasoned, the soup has a lively soul heightened by the onion and garlic to it when I mop up its last drop with my bun. Very satisfying.The Asian Tofu Salad was my option to complete my set. The Thai-style vinaigrette serve alongside so citrusy with a subtle heat. The aroma stemming from the sesame seeds did well to the salad. I love the nice fragrant deep fried beancurd, cut into cubes with a few wedges of that plump & juicy petit-size orange. Its tangy-sweet flavor freshen up the fried companion in the bowl. With added sunflower seeds, there was a faint nuttiness in the composite. What I didn't enjoy was the raw pea sprout taste, quite awful to me."

The chicken soup with a fancy name comes with generous portions of chicken chunks and some bits of mushroom, and is definitely enough to fill the tummy. The tomato soup is pretty simple, but I like it because there is a slight spicy kick. Their breadrolls are nothing to rave about, but try their nans if you're looking for something more filling.

Last but not least, their Velvety Mushroom Stroganoff is one of my staples - with chunks of mushroom and a thick, nice quality to it. It beats your typical weak cream of mushroom soup hands down. All soups are served with a bun, and have a price range of $6 to $10."

If you ever made soup, you will know the intense trouble that goes into making one so why not save the trouble and head down to The Soup Spoon. I am a fan of clear soups so naturally I went for the Asian chicken soup with lotus (that might be their only clear soup if I am not mistaken). The  portion healthy with generous chunks of chicken but then again that might depend on the person that scoops your soup.

My sis wanted to take her to a nice non-rowdy lounge. Note the legal drinking age in Singapore is 18. While my sis was away on a trip, I found a few options and let my niece choose. She chose the SKAI bar located at Swissotel The Stamford. Making a reservation is a breeze, I simply made the reservation online and chose the date, time and number of adults.This bar is definitely elevated on the 70th floor of Swissotel The Stamford. The night view was stunning though one really can't take any quality picture with the camera on the cellphones.SERVICE 5/5I was the first to arrive (of course right? Almost everyone who made plans with me tend to show up late. I wonder why?) I approached one staff and mentioned I had made a reservation. She led me to a table and since I noted on my reservation I would prefer us to get a table next to the floor to ceiling glass window, she said once a table by the windows opened up, I would be the first to get it. True enough a party left and the staffs quickly cleaned up that table and moved my water and snacks over. My sis and niece finally showed up almost half an hour later. We got our drinks and staffs would check on us periodically if we needed anything. I ordered a round of fries and they were really good. AMBIENCE 5/5This is not a family (with young children) friendly place. The bar is not huge but a good size. I like the ambience and the view from the 70th floor was beautiful. FOOD/BEVERAGE 4/5Limited non-alcoholic drinks. I wish there is a lot more variety. The fries were amazing!! I wanted to order another round. It was $10 a small basket. I thought it was not too expensive. Definitely need to add more bar bites on the menu. How about some chicken tenders?? Overall, it is a wonderful place and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a cozy place to unwind while enjoying the stunning view."

Secondly, for some crazy reason, we decided to try both Swee Kees to see (and taste) which Swee Kee reigns supreme, so this is a 2 part review, staring off with Sin Swee Kee. White (boiled) and Roasted Chicken Rice ($4.50 for thigh)At a glance, it did look very promising but the rice was a let down. While it looked really oily and flavourful, the rice was a little hard and didn't quite provide the same impact on the tongue as it did to the eyes. The flavored were decent but the rice was too hard to be really enjoyed.The white chicken was pretty decent. Flavourful and quite tender, although i did find the meat firmer and less smooth than others we've had. The roast chicken was pretty meh..... Nothing spectacular and for a thigh, it was a little on the dry side. Condiments: Now this is the saving grace of Sin Swee Kee. While everything else was pretty average, the chilli and ginger made all the difference. The chilli was tasty, a good kick of sourness and boy was it spicy! The finer was fragrant, oily and really help elevate the flavors of an otherwise very boring plate of rice. Soup of the Day ($3.50)The soup of the day was actually, surprisingly, pretty good. It really tasted of corn and red dates and complimented the rest of the meal very well. Overall, it's not the worst chicken rice we've ever had but it certainly doesn't stand out. Would give it a 2.5 at most but the condiments did help elevate this place to a 3. Don't forget to check out part 2 of the Battle of the Swee Kees in the next review."

Thus, Hainanese Chicken Rice rose to the top of my list of things to try (eat) during my (very) short stay in Singapore. Not much time to search Yelp, a lack of knowledge of where I would be in Singapore, and absurdly slow internet the few days prior to when I would be there, led me to just following the crowd to where we would eat chicken rice. Sin Swee Kee is where I ended up.When I first walked in, I noticed it was VERY busy. It was lunch time, and it seemed like a lot of the patrons were businessmen/women on their lunch breaks. Busy is a good thing, so they must have VERY good chicken rice. Lots of locals, so their chicken rice must be good. My logic doesn't ever seem to fail me! Or so I thought. Our meal started off with the iced barley drink, which was probably the best thing I ingested in this restaurant. My parents told me to drink it all because it was good for you. Why, you don't have to tell me! It's delicious, I'll easily finish this up! We had a bigger party, so we ordered everything family style. We each had a plate of rice, the signature rice that is served with the Hainanese Chicken Dish. This, I thought definitely lacked the flavor and aroma of what chicken rice should have. We tried both styles of chicken, the roasted and steamed, and while they were both juicy, the taste of old-frozen chicken was just too overwhelming. Together, it just led to a mediocre dish. Now, I've only had Hainanese Chicken Rice twice prior to my meal here. The first one was a few years ago when my dad attempted this dish, and the second was the day before at Universal Studios Singapore. Universal Studio's overpriced theme-park quality food was almost just as good as the chicken rice from Sin Swee Kee. For my dad's first time trying Hainanese Chicken Rice a few years ago, I remember that being WAYY better than what I was served here. Besides the main chicken rice dish, our party had a few side dishes to go along with our meal. That included the Aust lettuce, sweet and sour pork, tofu with eggplant, and boiled bean sprouts. Honestly I enjoyed eating the side dishes more than I enjoyed eating the chicken. I guess I'll have to return to Singapore to find a much better place that serves a whopping Hainanese Chicken Rice!"

Unlike a hawker stall, this is a restaurant that provides table service which is efficient and friendly. You'll sit on stools in a room open to the street (no air conditioning) in a traditional Asian restaurant format. A menu with photographs makes it especially tourist friendly.Beside the very flavorful chicken and rice, the ""meal"" comes with a tasty soup and an especially delicous serving of Chinese green vegetables in a succulent oyster sauce. All this plus a nice lime drink beverage will set you back no more than S$6.00 including, if you so choose, a tip.For truly superior Chicken Rice, venture over to Maxwell Road Food Court to Tian Tian's.  But for a very good version of the Hainanese dish that is more conveniently located for most tourists, Sin Swee Kee will do well indeed."

Secondly, for some crazy reason, we decided to try both Swee Kees to see (and taste) which Swee Kee reigns supreme, so this is a 2 part review, staring off with Sin Swee Kee. White (boiled) and Roasted Chicken Rice ($4.50 for thigh)At a glance, it did look very promising but the rice was a let down. While it looked really oily and flavourful, the rice was a little hard and didn't quite provide the same impact on the tongue as it did to the eyes. The flavored were decent but the rice was too hard to be really enjoyed.The white chicken was pretty decent. Flavourful and quite tender, although i did find the meat firmer and less smooth than others we've had. The roast chicken was pretty meh..... Nothing spectacular and for a thigh, it was a little on the dry side. Condiments: Now this is the saving grace of Sin Swee Kee. While everything else was pretty average, the chilli and ginger made all the difference. The chilli was tasty, a good kick of sourness and boy was it spicy! The finer was fragrant, oily and really help elevate the flavors of an otherwise very boring plate of rice. Soup of the Day ($3.50)The soup of the day was actually, surprisingly, pretty good. It really tasted of corn and red dates and complimented the rest of the meal very well. Overall, it's not the worst chicken rice we've ever had but it certainly doesn't stand out. Would give it a 2.5 at most but the condiments did help elevate this place to a 3. Don't forget to check out part 2 of the Battle of the Swee Kees in the next review."

Thus, Hainanese Chicken Rice rose to the top of my list of things to try (eat) during my (very) short stay in Singapore. Not much time to search Yelp, a lack of knowledge of where I would be in Singapore, and absurdly slow internet the few days prior to when I would be there, led me to just following the crowd to where we would eat chicken rice. Sin Swee Kee is where I ended up.When I first walked in, I noticed it was VERY busy. It was lunch time, and it seemed like a lot of the patrons were businessmen/women on their lunch breaks. Busy is a good thing, so they must have VERY good chicken rice. Lots of locals, so their chicken rice must be good. My logic doesn't ever seem to fail me! Or so I thought. Our meal started off with the iced barley drink, which was probably the best thing I ingested in this restaurant. My parents told me to drink it all because it was good for you. Why, you don't have to tell me! It's delicious, I'll easily finish this up! We had a bigger party, so we ordered everything family style. We each had a plate of rice, the signature rice that is served with the Hainanese Chicken Dish. This, I thought definitely lacked the flavor and aroma of what chicken rice should have. We tried both styles of chicken, the roasted and steamed, and while they were both juicy, the taste of old-frozen chicken was just too overwhelming. Together, it just led to a mediocre dish. Now, I've only had Hainanese Chicken Rice twice prior to my meal here. The first one was a few years ago when my dad attempted this dish, and the second was the day before at Universal Studios Singapore. Universal Studio's overpriced theme-park quality food was almost just as good as the chicken rice from Sin Swee Kee. For my dad's first time trying Hainanese Chicken Rice a few years ago, I remember that being WAYY better than what I was served here. Besides the main chicken rice dish, our party had a few side dishes to go along with our meal. That included the Aust lettuce, sweet and sour pork, tofu with eggplant, and boiled bean sprouts. Honestly I enjoyed eating the side dishes more than I enjoyed eating the chicken. I guess I'll have to return to Singapore to find a much better place that serves a whopping Hainanese Chicken Rice!"

Overall, Tess Bar & Kitchen is a solid place for food, and also can be for cocktails.  The talents and influence of the french trained (Rubuchon) chef really shows, and is a pleasant surprise.  The wine lists looks fairly short but well priced, but the cocktails we ordered seemed to go along with the food just as well.  So when you want to go to a place for cocktails and for a more substantial meal, Tess Kitchen and Bar works very nicely!"

So we walked past many diners and finally landed ourselves at Pizzeria Giardino, located at the Lawn area of Chijmes, cos we were attracted to the authentic wood-fired oven where they cook all their signature pizzas.We ordered the Pollo Chicken Pizza and the Ruccola Salad. The pizza was filled with fillings loads of cheese and the thin pizza crust was great. The salad was also great with generous servings of parma ham. The portions, add together, is a little too much for 2 pax to share on such a late night, but it's not overwhelmingly excessive. If you enjoy sitting out on the lawn on a cool evening and enjoy some italian classics, Pizzeria Giardino is a great place to be.

However, even before we took our first bite, we couldn't help but be drawn in by their al fresco dining area amidst the lush green trees of the charming, Chijmes convent complex.Cheese lovers, opt in for the Quattro Formaggi pizza, adorned with an extremely generous portion of mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmesan, and scamarza. Taking a bite of this pizza is like you imagine a pizza should be, as the chewy, doughy crust pulls away from the main slice, while the thick, hot, cheesy layer hangs on a bit longer, stretching and stretching as you try to get it all in your mouth.  Best of all, with all the cheese packed on, this ritualistic process happily continues until the very last bite is in your mouth.For those Tiramisu fans, you can't go wrong by ordering their take on this fan favorite, but we personally are suckers for their Profiteroles, the puff pastries filled with creamy ricotta cheese and drizzled with warm, rich chocolate sauce."

The layout is pretty standard, with squarish tables and as Jessica pointed out, the table is quite multi funtional, with a drawer for spoons and chopsticks, electronic tablet for ordering and also an electronic stove which I reckon is for heating up water for tea (maybe).Now to the main point the soup. This is the Singaporean meaty and peppery type of soup. The spice and meat taste came out pretty nicely in the soup. They are very generous with their meat portions (I guess proportional to the price) and I was pretty impressed that the meat was tender and tasty. They do give some garlic as well, but the setback is that the garlic wasnt boiled long enough, hence it was still a little hard. The other important component is the rice. Typically the rice tends to be hard and dry, but over here, the rice is cooked just right and still fluffy when I ate it.Service was good, before I could request for more soup, my soup was topped up with more piping hot and tasty soup. It wasn't really diluted like some joints. The condiments counter had freshly minced garlic and chilli padi.I would recommend a try if you are looking for tasty peppery soup in the CBD area and do not want to perspire when having piping hot soup."

Va Va Voom is average and doesn't serve anything close to what you can get in Vietnam, but it's reasonably priced and the portions are well-sized. One of the reasons behind my love affair with Vietnam's cuisine are the herbs used to heighten flavours in their dishes, and Va Va Voom really falls flat on this one. The pho bo is distinctly lacking in these, as is their fresh spring roll. However, I was quite pleased with their bun with fried spring rolls, and I think I'll stick with this one the next time I go. They have great deals at lunchtime - SGD 9 for a main, drink and ice-cream - and happy hour on their beers and ciders in the early evenings. Because of these aspects, I would say that Va Va Voom is a good choice if you're on a budget, but don't expect to be transported to Vietnam with this experience."

However it was tasty and mushroom-y (without being overpoweringly so). It also came in a big bowl, and was served with quite a lot of baguette, instead of the token one or two slices that most places give you. The baguette was reasonably crusty too.The chicken genovese pasta (the type with pesto) was alright - nothing noteworthy either way.The Grilled Furikake Salmon on Potato Risotto was really interesting. It was salmon with a crispy seaweed and sesame seed crust, served on a bed of mashed potato (yeah, that's what the potato risotto essentially was). This was a pretty unusual dish, with the salmon having a crispy crust, and a pleasantly intense umami flavour permeating the flesh. It is rare for salmon to be non-generic tasting and this combination was a winner.Dimbulah is very cheap for the area (this is the heart of Yuppie-land), with the pastas and the fish and chips going for $14. And prices are nett prices too (no 7-17% surcharge).Service was a little slow though, and they mixed up our order."

I started with the vegetarian spring rolls which were nothing short of amazing. No dipping sauce required and I would go back just for the Spring rolls. For my main I went western as I wanted to try their thin crust pizza. It was light and tasty and while not of the same genre as artisan pizzas, it certainly held its own. They could probably add more spices to it, but you could tell the ingredients were fresh.I was pleasantly surprised with Real Food and I would definitely go back for the Spring Rolls and the great service."

We had ordered the side dish of chicken wings and it came to our table but it did not look appetizing at all, and not tasty too.I think the only thing that saved the meal was the average tasting brownie topped with ice cream.

This time, we visited Danro Collagen Hotpot Buffet Punggol Waterway Point to try out its 美人锅 (Beauty Hotpot) and thought it was well worth it.The price of Danro Collagen Hotpot Buffet Punggol Waterway Point is actually pretty inexpensive. At $24.90++ for adults (and $13.90++ for kids) for dinners and weekends, it's not too bad. But if you're able to make it for lunch during weekdays, prices goes as low as $15.90++ for adults and $11.90++ for kids! Now, that's a steal! Do note that you'll have to top up $5, if you'd like to try the collagen soup base.Read the full review on 2bearbear!"

The fried oyster here is really delicious. The oysters are plump and large but the uncle also has perfected the balance between the gooeyness from the starch, while also frying everything till it's nice and crispy. Top if off with the sour and spicy chili sauce and the whole dish just works. So indulgent but so satisfying.They also do a wonderful oyster omelet that is light and fluffy with the same plump oysters. It also goes really well with some curry fish head and rice from another store in the same coffeeshop. Good crispy fried oysters + cold beer. Win."

I used to go quite often to buffets, and as father time catches up to you, well, not so much anymore. But after a day of wakeboarding, you're stomach is growling and a buffet seems like a great idea. And if you're a fan of seafood, Sakura is a pretty decent choice. It's a grill + Shabu Shabu buffet which offers a large selection of seafood (prawns, salmon, dory, shrimp, scallop, squid, etc. - some is frozen mind you), pork, beef, chicken which are all delicious when thrown on the grill. A lot of the food is pre-marinated as well, so you can try a bunch of different things without getting bored. They also have veggies and fishballs for shabu shabu, and a small selection of cooked food as well.Some stuff is better than others, for instance the sushi is terrible, but all in all it's worth the $30 you'll pay for an all you can eat dinner on a weekend.I wouldn't say it's amazing, but for the value, it's pretty good, especially given that there is quite a good seafood selection."

The restaurant is quite big with 2 sections, 1 towards the carpark and 1 towards the sea. Be prepared to get your hair and clothes smoked up as the whole environment will be very smoky due to the bbq.The price is quite affordable at $26++ par adult and the range of food there is not bad as well. Alot of meat varieties and marinates that come along with it. There are other food to choose from like sushi and desserts with quite a variety. Each table will have their individual hot pot cum mini bbq pit to bbq their meat. A good place to hang out with friends or colleagues."

The amount of black sauce they use is just right - not too sweet, not too salty. And the carrot cake is cut up to just the right size, which makes it easy to eat spoonfuls of it.Their fried oyster omelette is also worth checking out. Loads of starchy goodness mixed with crispy fried egg and oysters and some killer chilli sauce to go with it. This place gets my vote!"

This neighborhood cze char stall specializing in crabs was recommended to me by a friend who lives near it. She bought a number of dishes to takeaway to my place on one of our girls gathering that got me rather impressed. We didn't have crab that time though. Noteworthy dishes were the fried rice,  beancurd seafood roll and prawn paste chicken. The second and third time I ate from Master Crab (also takeaway), we had crab beehoon. They were consistently good both times though the crab on the first account was better, like, really really mind blowing good -- fresh, fleshy and sweet. Funny thing was, the quantity of crab beehoon we got was the same both times though the first time we ordered for two pax ($39, which I thought was incredibly cheap for such a good crab!) and the second time we did for four pax! ($54) We even asked for more beehoon!   I think the price difference could just be reflecting the difference in the weight of the two crabs, so fair enough. But the amount of beehoon we got couldn't feed two pax, much less four! I suspect it was because they only have one takeaway box size and make the dish to fit into it. But still... So yeah this episode made me a little wary of getting takeaway crab dishes from them. I will, however, return to try more crab dishes at the restaurant, especially their specialty -- salty egg crabs, heard it's awesome!"

Brown mushroom sauce was poured over the beef. I found that the meat was succulent and sweet, definitely one of the better steaks I have eaten. The sauce was rather disappointing however; I found that it lacked flavor. Fortunately, the meat was good enough on its own.My friend had lamb chop, which came with fries and salad. The fries were thick and very nice. I asked to try a piece of the lamb chop and I was quite surprised to find that it was really tender.

One dish that other stalls might not have is the fried hor fun which tastes similar to char kway teow and also the sin chow bee hoon which is simply just yummy. I have tried other sin chow bee hoon else where but till date this is the best i can find.Other dishes to try that goes along with white rice are the sambal kang kong, salted egg prawn (which is the best because they de-shell it for you!

Walked through an almost dead dining town on a Monday night and saw an eatery called Leong Ji Signature on level 2. They were selling Zi Char and decided to see what they offered. Was surprised they offered the White Bee Hoon too and decided to order a plate to try plus the Prawn Paste Chicken aka Har Cheong Kai. The White Bee Hoon was pretty moist with good amount of sauce to go with and I personally felt that it was just as good as the other outlet. But the Har Cheong Kai was not as good due to the paste they use to marinate it in. It tastes pretty hard rather than crispy. Was leaving when I over heard another table order the Chao Ta Bee Hoon.

They provide a bowl water with lemon for hand cleaning. The Butter Crab need to come out first. It has the sweet butter taste. If the pepper crab come out first, the taste will over shadow the butter crab. The crab meat is abundant. The crawl is huge. They have a mechanical machine to crack the crawl.

I'd not been to Punggol in at least 30 or so years and upon arrival it was a stark difference from the dark, dusty village street I remember and was now a modern restaurant with bright lights and all the amenities and conveniences including tv screens.There's a bit of an unspoken tradition within our family in Singapore, in that everyone will always try to shout the other person's meal. With Dad being one of 14 children to his parents, there is certainly a rush to pay the bill, when it gets near the end of the meal and at times, there can be a bit of jostling between cousins, uncles and aunties to take care of the payment. Sometime I even go to the extreme where I'll pretend to go to the restrooms and sneakily pay before anyone else has had the chance.If it's not lines that tell you whether a restaurant is any good or not, you'll see photos of celebrities, certificates of awards and merit and newspaper clippings that adorn the facade and exterior of the restaurant and this one is famed for its crab.I must agree with other advisors in that the serving sizes were a bit on the small side but the taste and balance of flavours were near on perfect and the best crab I've ever had in my 30 plus years of heading to Singapore.Disregarding the portion size, the crabs were juicy and full of meat which isn't often the case and at other establishments I'm forever feeling for crab shell in my mouth with the claws shell shattered by the chef but I found the crab here to not have that issue and can only put it down to being carefully cracked open.The sauce was awesomely balanced and not too sweet with just a hint of chill and the black pepper crab sauce was head and shoulders above any other I'd tried and not too peppery, just right.The menu was massive and one of the most beautiful photographically to look and all the other dishes were superb and included deep fried, crispy squid aka Sotong Goreng, sizzling deer, sambal kang kong, seafood bee hoon, spicy and sweet pork ribs.All in all we had a great night and stayed until we were the last ones there and they made no mention of it.Cheers!Dave."

Mike Chen, you gotta try this place. *Be glad to show you this place.* The spicy version is rather hot. I suggest ordering the non-spicy version and add chillies yourself. Their condiments is amazing. The chopped onions with lime/citrusy juice is just so perfect for the spicy frog legs. The smooth legs of the frogs is just even more tender than any chicken. Its a rather worthwhile death for the frogs if you lick em clean.Very clean eatery. Can be quite busy but service is efficient. Do be patient with them ya. Come slightly before dinner time like 5/6pm to avoid the crowds.3 frog legs for $16 while 2 frog legs for $13. It seems more value to get the 3 legs dish. Porridge is $2 or $3 for a pot and the $3 pot is really huge for groups of 3 or more. Even their vegetables like potato leaves, kailan is just so amazing! You can treat this as a semi chi-char place.

One of the waitress looked at us like aliens and told us she's very busy, but she instead went next table for drinks and smoke. Before we left, we requested for some iced water, and a thin guy at the bar gave us another alien look for a few seconds, then he slowly brought out 2 glasses of water for 10 of us. we don't mind paying for the water if it's needed, but don't stared at us. His behavior was annoying.We felt that all the staff there were very rude not friendly, they only concentrate on their own friends that were there that night.

The ribeye, fish tofu & fishball with roe egg came deep deep frozen. The slices of beef stuck together you could not separate them without tearing them into smaller pieces. The fish tofu were hard as ice & took ages to defrost & warmed up in the broth. Extremely disappointed that the frozen food were not defrosted before serving. It was indeed an uniquely bad mookata dining experience for us. Only three tables on a Friday night.

My family totally loves it. Not forgetting to mention on their fish maw soup and shark fin soup. For the price you are paying, I would expect lesser ingredient and more soup.

We appreciated the fact that we were informed beforehand that the restaurant was booked for a wedding event and we would be dining at the SAFRA Ballroom (next to restaurant) instead. When we arrived, we were shown to the Ballroom which looked like a makeshift room with tables and chairs. The air-con wasn't turned on. We realized it's stuffy and had to tell the service staff to turn it on. When the dishes were served, we were very disappointed with the portion. The pieces of pork ribs weren't enough to go round the table. The rice bowls resemble those toy bowls that my kids play at home. So, we had to order additional bowls of rice (maybe that's the whole idea!). It doesn't help make us feel any better, with the slow service on that day. I guess the service staff would have to go over next door to pick up the dishes and collect bowls of rice to bring over to the Ballroom. The price may seem reasonable on the menu, but we don't find much value-for-money, judging the petite portions. The quality of the dishes didn't disappoint us, at the very least. The pork ribs 京都排骨 dish was nicely done, though could be better if it's slightly more tender; the sweet and sour grouper fish 酸甜鱼 is wonderful to the palate of kids. To add to the enjoyment, the crispy skin roasted chicken 脆皮鸡was excellent - crispy on the skin, tender on the meat. Not to forget the crispy salted egg salmon skin 咸蛋炸鱼皮 as starter.  Perhaps, I may consider returning, when the restaurant is available for dining."

The beancurd Is crispy on the outside and smooth in the inside.We also had the peking duck skin with crepe. Usually, this dish is not my favorite and the peking duck skin here did not change my opinion. I felt that the duck skin had lost its texture. The noodles cooked with duck meat was really good though. Next, we had the salted egg prawn, which came with a coating of salted egg around the prawn. This is my first time eating this dish and I really liked it as well.Overall, this is a good place to come for good food, although the prices could be slightly lower."

All the dishes that came taste it great. There was just the right amount of flavor and as of now I am reviewing this one hour after we finish our lunch I don't feel thirsty which usually is the case with Cantonese/Chinese restaurants where they add a lot of monosodium glutamate to the food.The server told us that for lunch we are entitled to 30% discount which does not apply to sets.

Being one of the big players in our local cze char market now, Uncle Leong Seafood started off humbly at a coffeeshop in Ang Mo Kio district. Their shimmering crabs won the hearts of many when it was first introduced to the market in Year 2003 and was since one of their signature dish even till today. Although Ang Mo Kio stall was no longer around, but you could still enjoy their delicacies at Jurong East and Toa Payoh branches. Not forgetting the newly opened Uncle Leong Signatures at Punggol district new Waterway Point shopping mall.Uncle Leong Signatures, this newly additional arm, was up featuring all Uncle Leong's signature dishes and also new modern fusion creations. Although called ""Signatures"" but settings were simple and casual. This night, we tried out many dishes, some were newly introduced to the menu, some dishes were specially featured for this upcoming Father's Day in June. Father's Day menu (FDM) available now till 19 June 2016.1* Treasure Box Beancurd 宝盒豆腐 $16.90 [New]- Tofu, a common ingredient that we see's everyday, Uncle Leong recreated them into an exquisite dish filled with goodness from the sea. By making an opening in every piece, filled them up with fresh scallops and prawn cubes, they transformed into many treasure boxes filled with ""gold""! Although the overall taste of tofu can be rather bland, but the seafood were definitely fresh! Not forgetting the crispy shredded scallops placed on top helped to enhanced the taste too! Rating 3/52* Nescafé Pork Ribs 传统咖啡排骨 $16.90 (FDM)- Love the taste of the sweet sauce coated on the ribs which carries hints of bitterness derived from Nescafé coffee infusion. Coffee fragrance was captivating too! Fans of coffee definitely love this dish! As told by the chef, these generous chunky pieces of ribs were individually wrapped in aluminum foil, then marinated for more than 4hours before stew! I couldn't tell you how tender and fragrant was the pork, you gotta try it to experience it yourself! Rating 5/53* Twin Taste Kai Lan 双味芥兰 $15.90- Glad to see that Uncle Leong made changes to our usual plain ordinary Kai lan vegetables but there's more room for improvement in this dish. Deep fried kailan leaves were tasteless and the chicken floss accompanying them tasted too ordinary. Maybe using Chinese sausages or bacon bits would worked better than this combi, or at least use crispy floss instead. Lucky the stems wasn't overly blanched, crunchiness still remains. Rating 1/54* Crispy Milk Granules Marble Goby 奶沙顺壳 $48.00 (FDM)- This marble goby was deep fried till crispy you could even swallow the bones. The sauce for this goby was pretty impressive too. It tasted like a combi of thai tom yum sauce plus assam and bit of sweet chilli. The tangy sourish aftertaste made the whole dish really appetizing and made me go for more!! Rating 5/55* Cereal Chicken 麦片鸡 $16.90 [New]- Chicken pieces deep fried till crispy on the exterior, locking juicy meat on the inside. The zesty lemony sauce drizzled on top did add more flavours to the dish but it tends to turn the chicken soggy after awhile. My most love part towards this dish was the buttery cereals crunchies scattered on top! Rating 3/56* XO Sauce Scallops XO酱带子 $19.90 [New]- I'm actually a fan of juicy fat plump scallops but those here were way too tiny. The size was more of like those you accompanied with broccoli rather than a stand alone dish. Texture was good but disappointed I couldn't taste that umami scallop taste! The XO sauce used was the only memorable moment. Rating 2/57* Pan-fried Prawns w/ Tomato Soya Sauce 干煎虾䘵 $19.90 [New]- Expected ""Wok hei"" taste for these pan-fried prawns but was again disappointed. Prawn texture wasn't firm and my piece was a little mushy at head portion, I reckon that prawns wasn't very fresh. Soya sauce base  was rather sweet but I like, pretty good to ""下饭"". Rating 2/58* Chilli Crabs 辣椒螃蟹 and Butter Cheesy Crab 牛油芝士螃蟹 $70.00 each crab-  Crabs were priced at $70.00 each, applied to any style of cooking. This plate of Chilli crab we had, the gravy was thick and packed w/ lotsa eggs! Taste was quite good, I definitely had better ones elsewhere, but I love the spicy kick it gave me :) I had my deep fried ""man tou"" soaked in the gravy before I ate it, so shiok!! Crab meat was firm and sweet too, I just wished that the crab they used was bigger in size. Rating 4/5- Butter Cheesy crab, the appearance of it already puzzled us. What were the loads of brown bits scattered everywhere? After we tasted it, we were quite turned off. Those brown bits were deep fried garlic. So much, so charred, we only tasted ""chao tah"" bitterness and 0% cheesy butter taste. The garlic totally spoilt the sweetness of seafood. I guess this dish needed quite abit of fine tuning.

Just opened 3 months ago by Len and Jon, these young and energetic duo have tasted the goodness of authentic Thai Mookata in Thailand. They then decided to bring back this delicious family sharing style of food to Singapore. They spent time learning the authentic marinating methods and tweaked their recipe to suit Singaporean taste buds.Their menu seemed very reasonable for a HDB coffeeshop. $28 for 2-3 pax and $45 for 4-5pax for a mookata set. Ala carte add-ons start at $3 for thai black pepper chicken, farlic lean meat and pork belly!Mookata Set for 4-5 pax - Lots of varietyFor the set menu, here's what you get1. Thai Black Pepper Chicken2. Thai Garlic Lean Meat3. Prawns4. Sotong5. Scallops6. Pork Ball7. Crab Stick8. Fish Ball10. Hot dog11. Xiao Bai Cai12. Cabbage13. Golden Mushroom14. Sweet Corn15. Carrot16. Tang Hoon17. EggLooking at the amount of ingredients for the price, I must say, this is probably the most bang for the buck mookata I've seen. There's a huge variation of ingredients at about $10 per pax. There is no beef in the set but you can order beef slices from the ala carte menu.Owner Len explained that here at Chok Chai, they strongly believe in providing you with the authentic Thai experience, so much so that they import chilli from Thailand. They have invested in their own grinding techniques to make their own in-house chilli. He shared that the chilli had coriander, garlic and a mix of ""secret"" ingredients to give it the wow factor.The bacon strips had a good ratio of fats to meat and it was extremely juicy and oily after grilling for some time.A mookata experience is all about sharing food with your friends and family and cooking food together and for one another. It's a great opportunity for bonding.The lean meat was very well marinated with a somewhat sweeter marinate in comparison to the other meats. It was very tasty and slightly chewy with every bite. It was definitely one of my favourite choice of meats during the meal.The liver cooked very quickly in the hot boiling soup surrounding the grill iron. It was very tasty and definitely pretty fresh.The mookata broth was made with pork bone, white radish, pandan leaves and more ""secret"" ingredients. This according to owner Len was the ""authentic"" soup broth he had learnt from his trips to Thailand. So there's basically only one soup broth available here and there's no tom yum options either. The maggie noodles were seriously awesome as they could really absorb all the soup essence in one go. After we cooked the noodles, we had to repeatedly top up the soup. The Thai speaking staff were also very attentive and noticed the soup levels going down each time we cooked the noodles and volunteered to top up the soup for us, despite having a kettle of soup placed next to the mookata.There's also a separate dish of vegetables. I'm no rabbit so vegetables aren't for me, but I did love their generous serving of enoki mushrooms.Som Tam (Papaya Salad) with Fresh PrawnA famous Thai appetizer for any Thai meal be it mookata or not is Som Tam. But as I don't eat spicy foods, I've never actually been able to gobble down a Som Tam myself. According to my friends who tried it, they all said it was spicy! But looking at the generousity of the prawns, I can tell Chok Chai is pretty game to deliver an appetizer to whet your appetite.Overall : Hidden gem in Ang Mo Kio, very reasonable prices for mookata with quality ingredients accompanied with great service.Now, if only they served Thai iced milk tea! I would have a complete thai dinner!"

The steamboat soup is salty as it included salted fish. The service is bad as well, we try to order drinks after drinking the salty soup for at least 3 times, but end up, they didn't serve the drinks at all."

Didn't fancy the disposable utensils but it keeps serving & clearing more efficient. It gets crowded in the evenings when people knock off work & come by for drinks & bites. Nice, laid-back place. You would expect service to be slack since there's NO service  & GST charge, but No. it's personal & quite attentive. drop a tip for the server(s) if you appreciate the servic If you enjoy good bites, drinks set in a casual neighbourhood, you should check out Tachinomiya.

If you are familiar with the popular Tori Tori yakitori seen in malls, the take out box is like that. While there's a Japanese feel of efficiency, it does take away the presentation. The Katsu curry rice is reasonable in taste but the Gyu beef in soy sauce was somewhat too saltish for my preference. For the price of the lunch set with miso and Ocha is reasonable. The yakitori was a bit of disappointment. It was dry and tough. From the open kitchen, I noticed that the yakitori was partially prepared in oven instead of the traditional grill.It is worth to give it a try and hopefully they have fine tune the recipe the next time I visit."

The pasta sauce was definitely spicier than I had expected. It's not bad, tangy and spicy. The only thing I would criticize is that the pasta serving is too small, and if you are someone who doesn't like to DIY, don't try this place out. The shrimps were small and unfresh, and I would expect something more out of a 11.90 meal. The beef entrees are probably much better, since they are the most popular entrees."

As I'm a fan of sticky rice and gravy, my usual dish of choice is the Curry Beef Pepper Rice with Cheese. Firstly, the food proportions are normally quite ample. Secondly, it tastes pretty fantastic. Mixing in the curry rice with cheese just brings warmth and comfort to my taste buds. One of the best combinations ever!I also have to commend on how tender the beef strips are, which come in quite a generous portion too.  If you're a student then it's double whammy for you because the eatery provides really good student discounts.

Appointment was at 5pm and the restaurant informed us that we will need to leave by 630pm as it would be time for the next session. We arrived at 445pm, had lohei at 505pm, and the first dish arrived only at 545pm (yes, 45mins waiting time for the first dish). It is puzzling why all the dishes that came out in the interim went to other tables. Perhaps we ordered a less expensive set meal? When the dishes came, the broccoli was overcooked, and the sharks fin soup was the saltiest that I have ever had. By the time the third dish came at 605pm, I had to leave for my next reunion dinner. Hence, I am unable to comment on the quality of the rest of the dishes. I can understand that business is brisk on the eve of cny. That said, the restaurant should have minimally ensured satisfactory service standard and food quality, both of which were totally absent during my stay there. If you would like to visit this restaurant, I would suggest that you visit at non-peak seasons. Hopefully, the waiting time is bearable and the food is edible."

The restaurant has ample seating and isn't too crowded even during lunch on a Friday. There were 6 of us in total. Ordered the following dishes: Butter chicken, mutton pepper fry, prawn mango magic (of course we had to have the magic dish!), curry magic fish pollichath (recommended by the restaurant owner), various naan breads and some basmati rice. We also had the mango lassi and masala tea for drinks. Overall the portions served were slightly disappointing especially given the price of each dish. The mutton pepper fry and pollichath fish were probably the better dishes, the butter chicken was average and the prawn mango magic was not the best due to the overpowering coconut milk in the curry and very small prawns. As for the drinks the mango lassi was refreshingly good (slightly thick though) and the masala tea was served in very large cups (worth the money!). To summarise, the food is average and prices are slightly steep given the portions, nothing magical here, there are better places for Indian food within the area and for a much more affordable price.PS:  Pictures aren't the best."
