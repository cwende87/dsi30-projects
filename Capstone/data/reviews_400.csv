It's simple ingredients and yet not all places make it well. This local popiah and kueh pie ti is very yummy and satisfying and it's just S$1.50 for popiah and 5 for S$3.00  for pie ti. The owner or person who I frequently see working is approachable and nice. He is quick with filling orders and you can tell he works hard. The popiah skin is fresh and he knows how to make the popiah with proper amounts of filling (jicama, carrots, etc), crispy bits, sauces, veggies, and crushed peanuts. I also prefer the sambal chili vs without but both tend to do the job. Oh also, he wraps it well so once it is cut, it doesn't fall part as quickly as other places that I've been to too. Apparently fortune food started off as a single successful hawker stand and now has branched off to multiple outlets. They also do party set orders which is neat too. Many locals also order the muah chee (glutenous rice balls coated with crushed peanut and sugar), which I feel is similar to Japanese mochi just with a different coating and spin on it. But generally it is quite tasty and not too sweet. Id recommend this place if you're in the area and to get the popiah and for the price you can't beat it. Check it out. Tip/ cash only Tip2/ try one with chili and one without and see what you prefer Tip3/ the hawker is in the food center that is just behind the Kovan MRT station so it's pretty convenient if you're making your way out this way"

My friend have been praising it for its palatable curry. To be frank, I was not too surprised by the taste of the green curry that I ordered. The flavor is indeed good but it is nothing special from good curry in other restaurants. The rice is also plain. However, what is impressive of the restaurant is that the price is proportional to the performance of the dishes, unlike some restaurants where the prices are inflated. In the green curry, there is a rather large portion of chicken(the customer can choose one from chicken, prawn, pork and beef to put into the curry)and dotted with some brinjals. I was amazed by the amount of chicken that I found in the curry. I did not expect so much meat in a dish priced $10.80. The great price performance ratio of the restaurant is worth a four-star overall rating."

Absolutely no complaints about it. The menu has a small or medium sized portion available ($12/20), and we both opted for the small which was actually a good sized portion. We were both very pleased. Then the bill arrived...we were charged $4+ for the mango salad, and $0.80 for wet naps--one of which we did not use. I refrained from arguing with the staff since we had gobbled up the mango salad without asking, and it's not worth arguing over 80 cents. Instead, I will think twice before returning.

Every weekend, Two Chefs Eating Place is bounded to be packed with a long line of customers queuing up. Their signature dish, the Butter Ribs 牛油排骨 has been highly raved about on the internet. I have been itching to try Two Chefs Eating Place for more than two years. The travelling journey was the main reason why I had been procrastinating for so long. I was thrilled when I got to know that Two Chefs Eating Place had opened a second outlet at Sin Ming (that's near Upper Thompson / Bishan). In fact, it's just located next to Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery which is the largest Mahayana Temple in Singapore. It would be timely to visit and try out their dishes.I believed that Two Chefs Eating Place either bought over or rented the entire coffee shop. The staff at the drink, roti prata and vegetarian stalls were all wearing Two Chef's uniform. The coffee shop was just half full during lunch time on a weekend. In fact, when we arrived at 1215pm, the place was literally empty except for another group of customers. There were many ceiling and wall fans that helped ventilate the place.Two Chefs Eating Place's menu with over 79 dishes. If you are visiting for the first time, you might want to ask the staff to recommend their signature dishes. We ordered several of their signature items and did not have to wait long before the first dish was served to us.The Drunken Cockles  醉蚶 which has garnered lots of rave reviews online was the first dish to be served. The plate of half-shelled cockles was served cold. They were covered with light soya sauce covered with lots of garlic, spring onion and chilli padi. The cockles were fresh with no sand in it and had just a slight raw taste. I thought that this was just an average appetiser. Nothing great to should about. And of course, your mouth will stink after eating this dish (due to the raw garlic). =PThe Vegetable with Egg, Salted Egg and Century Egg 三蛋时菜 was another dish that Netizen raved about. It was another disappointment; badly executed. The spinach which was supposed to be soft was firm and hard. The gavy which should have been so tasty due to the 3 eggs and spinach was tasteless. The chef failed to extract the flavours of the ingredients into the gravy. I had better ones elsewhere.The Hot Plate Beancurd arrived sizzling hot. Executed slightly different from most other Cze Char stalls, instead of slices of round shaped beancurd, the beancurds (tofu) were long, rectangular in shape and were soft. The gooey brown gravy was tasty with lots of minced meat and egg underneath. The gravy complemented the rice well and was not overly salty. An average dish. Full review at FoodieFC's blog"

After reading through the reviews, I thought we should give it a shot. We ordered the ""must try"" cockles which turned out rather ordinary, and may have been responsible for my sis-in-law's diarrhea later as well. We ordered two crabs at $35 each, and one turned out to be so crappy that it's possibly the worst chili crab we ever had! They did replaced the bad crab though. The coffee ribs or something was not too bad, but they spoilt it by spooning powdered milk onto it! The egg-yolk shrimp is the only dish that's nice. Bottom line, it's our last time there. Totally disappointed and embarrassed as I brought my mother and my mother-in-law for dinner!"

Rice bowls are decent and I've gone back for them but I'd give the mee sua with oysters a miss. The strong fishy taste could not be covered by the vinegar which laced the bowl. The chicken cutlet was pretty good as was the bubble tea. Price wise, I'd say it's a bit pricey for the value of the food and tastiness of it."

I've official tried 75% of their menu! Majority of the items here are fried, so do note that. Most of their dishes are great for sharing for 2-3 pax.1. Salted Crispy Chicken $6.80One would expect them to sell the XL crispy chicken cutlet,  but they have this instead. Served hot and crispy, it's a great snack to share. It is slightly salty but just right for me.2. Five Spice Cheese Fries $4.80I love these cheese fries and I have to eat a lousy plate of cheese fries. The cheese itself is melted onto the fries and never hardens. The fries aren't crisp, they're more of the soggy kind and taste slightly peppery.3. Cheese Mantou $4.80The mantous were deep fried to crispiness and it had a generic cheese slice placed on top of it to melt. To be honest, I had higher expectations of this, the mantous were okay, and the cheese seriously just tasted like any kraft cheese.4. Eggroll with Pork Floss $6.80One of my more favourite snack dishes from here, I love pork floss and with the egg rolls, it adds some substance to the dish. It can get quite filling eating too much of this, but for $6.80 you get two rolls. Not alot, but enough for everyone to get a piece or two.5. Fried Prawn Omelette $7.80Quite oily but I'm used to their style of food here. Quite a number of prawns, cooked with veggies and beansprouts. Tasted decent.6. Scallion Pancake $4.80I love cong yu bing! Although my favourite is from Dong Bei Ren Jia in Chinatown, this isn't too bad either. It is like a crispy roti prata with a chewy inside.7. Brinjal with Pork Floss $4.80I rarely like to eat brinjal but this was a completely different experience. The brinjal was soft inside, almost like mushy pumpkin and on the outside, and a crispy batter on the outside.8. Fried Shitake Mushroom $8.80I liked their mushrooms. It was juicy on the inside and it had a very crispy batter on the outside. 9. Green Lime & Sour Plum $3.80Most of their hot drinks here, just make me suspect that they're instant powdered drinks. So I decided to go with a cold drink, this wasn't too bad. It tasted okay, and it was a hot day, so a cooling drink was the best option for me.10. Mango Snow Ice $6.80This is my favourite flavour of mango snow ice and they were quite generous with the mango, although this slightly more than what other shops charge for mango snow ice. The snow ice melted so quickly, it was rather upsetting. The shop though air conditioned, isn't that cool, they also use oscillating fans mounted on the walls to keep the shop cool.I made a reservation for 730pm on a friday and unlike the last time I visited, it has become a lot quieter. Not sure why, parking was simple ans straightforward as there's maybe 20 or so parallel parking HDB lots. Gotta bring your coupons."

It as okay. Self service menu and your go up front when you've marked your order and to pay. - Braised beef noodle: served warm which made it less enjoyable as well as inconsistency of the beef. Some pieces were very tough while others were fine. - Egg omelette: okay. I could do without the drizzle of sweet on top. - Scallion pancake: not bad. I'd say it was crispy and good. Could use more scallions. But it wasn't super oily so that is nice. Seems like a decently popular place, but I wouldn't mind trying the places near it too. Tip: No gst or service charge. Also free wifi. But in my opinion that doesn't matter if the food is only okay. Tip: They also accept credit cards"

Being well-acquisition with Taiwanese cuisine, I naturally had to head down to test out the dishes for myself. Between my family, we had quite a bit to share to have a good gauge of whether this place can make the cut of satisfying our cravings for Taiwanese food!We started off with the Cold Noodles - a typical Taiwanese street dish mixed in sesame sauce and sliced cucumbers. The one here was alright, bordering on tasteless but still alright and didn't quite have the right kick from the counterparts on the streets. We then got the salt-and-pepper chicken which is one of our night market favourites. We thought this was more aptly like popcorn chicken. The oyster omelet was decent, recognizing an effort to mimic a large proportion of flour mixture in typical Taiwanese oyster omelet. Not a bad dish but a different sauce from the ones in Taipei was used. At this point, we were thinking perhaps we shouldn't be expecting the dishes to taste like those in Taipei because it just made every dish taste that bit lacking.We rounded up with braised meat rice which tasted more sweet than the ones we had, as you will have with the fillings in dumplings. Maybe we started off wrongly, maybe we got it wrong, I don't know. It was alright, but not as authentic as people claim.In any case, I know they have their fair share of fans, so head down to decide for yourself."

I love their beer too which comes in a few flavours like grape, lychee and mango which are all really delicious to drink.I loved the oyster omelette too as it was exactly like the Taiwan version, eggy with crispy tapioca flour. The braised meat rice was delicious too really fragrant and the sauce blended well with the rice. The meat was also juicy and tender.There were other desserts there too like shaved ice and it felt like i was eating in Taiwan. Definitely a place to go for people who love Taiwan food."

The meat was tender and flavourful. The mash potato on the other hand, tasted instant but still not too bad to add a different taste to the salmon.Truffle Mushroom Pizza $15.80 The truffle smell was yumz, but it dissipated quickly. My dining partners commented that the portion of mushrooms was little though I did appreciate the size of the pizza. Definitely too much for 1, great for sharing amongst 2-3 with beers all around. The crust though thin-crust can make me pretty gerlat, think of khong-guan cream cracker style of crust texture.Bar bites:MAD wings $9.80 I requested for the sauce to be separate from the wings as I had feared the wings would turn soggy after an extended photo taking session. The MAD sauce was tangy and spicy at the same time! The wings came piping hot and were really crispy from top to tip.Battered silverfish with aioli dip Think of fish and chips but in a tinier version! The aioli dip was pretty addictive and I couldn't stop eating this, greasy, but so good!The strawberry milkshake was simply delightful! Perfect for a sunny Sunday 36C afternoon!Overall : The food is pretty good considering the Eatigo discount. I really can't complain for the quantity of food , not to mention the free parking on weekends at Breadtalk IHQ. The pizza is definitely worth mentioning along with the baked salmon! Service was also quick and friendly. I'm coming back to Meat N Malts to try more of their pizza and meat offerings for sure!"

It has a slight spiciness to it. The seafood also doesn't really come through. With two prawns and a couple of squid. The prawns are not even that great. It costs $27.The margherita was a nightmare and I wonder why Leslie Tay would even recommend this place! My microwave pizza box could probably taste even better. The thin crust dough was done rather well but the ""sauce"" on it was very average and just add a few cherry tomatoes on it.

Besides being served in a claypot, they gave a different feel from the mainstream hokkien mee as you can see significance differences in the ingredients.Claypot Hokkien Mee - $10A good few pieces of tasty ""Sio Bak"" (Roasted Pork Belly) had been given and apparently, you get to see ""La La"" in it, which is not common other than the usual prawns, squid, pork belly, pork lards and eggs.Ingredients Lay out for individual portionCrispy dark brown pork belly was delicious! It might be a little salty but it taste good alone with its crackling skin.As a whole in terms of Hokkien Mee, it does have its consistency but still lacking of a good strong stock punch that will actually lift the dish up. Noodles was wet enough, wasn't the dry version that I have read. Personally, I was kind of disappointed about taste but still its a good to know about such dish with tasty pork belly exists."

I think if I have not tried Come Daily (especially when it was still fried by the father), I will rate this as very good. The fun and wow factor is definitely the claypot as the noodle will come bubbling furiously with steam wafting all over it. And you actually get to taste 2 versions of the Hokkien Mee. The wet version when you dish it out with plenty of gravy over it. And then the dry version after the noodle has soaked up all the gravy when you are on your 2nd or 3rd plate. It took me a while to make out what is the difference between this and Come Daily as both are good. This is not as rich or full flavored so you will not get the ""jelak"" feeling after you finished.  It is still flavorful but I just feel something is missing - the jelakness. Hahahaha. For the $10 claypot (more than enough for 2 persons, though the guy tried to persuade us to order the $15), we get 2 prawns, plenty of tiny sotong rings, 3 clams and some deep fried pork belly and lard. The pork belly was very salty to eat on its own. The chili was average.Oh and you need to take your own plates and cutlery and chili and lime to your table. The service is brusque, not exactly the most friendly. The or luak was not available when we were there and they could not give a simple answer when we asked when it would be available again. It was a most evasive answer which told us nothing. I would only go back again when the or luak is available. And this is the same coffee shop where the famous Ocean Fish Head Curry is.  Note: If you take the bus, alight at Jackson Square. It can be quite a walk from both Braddell and Toa Payoh MRT stations.

Thus, you can imagine I was filled with excitement when my bff suggested that we visit this restaurant. To be frank, I've forgotten how good the food tasted due to the passage of time. But, I'm really happy that everything that we ordered tasted Super!The most enjoyable food was the (1) Garlic Bread - so tender and fragrant with a strong garlic taste .. just the way I like it. Definitely a 5 stars here just for this alone (2) the fried mushrooms - oooooh so tasty & juicy!! A must-try absolutely! (3) Minestrone Soup - flavourful & rich .. really like it a lot (4) Beef Brisket - so tender, juicy they melt in your mouth!Interestingly, the decor has not changed at all since I last visited it. It is not surprising then that I really enjoyed the Super delish meal as I was dining with my very close friend ... and at the same time filled with a strong sense of nostalgia of my past visits to this place with my other close friends.The service was friendly & great! The staff that served us has been working here for more than 10 years. She told us that there has been a change of management. What I'm Glad to know is that there has been no impacts on the food quality.For folks wanting really good & tasty Western food, coming to this restaurant in the North East is definitely a good choice. The prices are really reasonable in view of their food quality & service standards. The beer prices are good too! I believe it's 3 beers for $18 (very reasonable by SG standards)Lastly .. just like to wish everybody a really Marvellous 2020!! Wishing all a Blessed & Wonderful Year!!! First review 2020."

The Works (spiciness ranging from mild to raging hot), Garlic Butter and Peppa Butter. The Works is piquant with an assam-like tang, but not too spicy. With lobsters shipped in daily from US, the taste can hardly go wrong. Sweet and not overcooked, the chunky fleshes might be a hassle to remove from the shells at first but all efforts were rewarded when you mopped down with the sauces.But we soon found out that it's got more to offer than the lobster. Pick from brown crabs, prawns, mussels, clams and then choose your sauce. That said, the heartiest way to round off the evening is to feast on the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139/4); literally a seafood bomb filled with everything including sausages, corns and some deep-fried mantou buns at the side for soaking up the juices. The starters were overall quite impressive too. The Louisiana Spicy Mid Joint Wings ($8.90) were zappy with a nice sour kick that makes you grab for more. The Southern Chicks and Waffles ($9.90) had plenty of crisp, not only in the chicken but more importantly in the waffles that were drizzled in maple syrup. I shy away from the Bacon Shrimp ($11.90) in smoky Hickory sauce because they were too salty. As for the Fish & Chips ($12.90), it's a classic in its own league. The fish stayed moist and piping hot within a light, crunchy batter. The Signature Lobsicle ($15.90), aka lobster on Popsicle, might be safer in the Boiler instead of the deep fryer as they were too chewy.Business was so good that the chocolate molten lava cake ran out of stock and so we settled for the C.B.D, a pungent pun on the business district of Singapore because it stood for Crispy Banana Durians. Forget about the Bananas were substituted by yams that night, cos the pungent durians have already stolen the limelight. As we all know, never judge a restaurant by the history or the location. Despite being opened only for a few months, it's no nonsense when it comes to the Cajun-style lobsters here. Walk in, sit down and put on the apron. We did. And we ate. We ate very well indeed."

It's a queer location for a seafood spot but we absolutely dig the cavernous space and their delicious offerings. It made perfect sense for us to order the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139) since there's a huge group of us (we had 3 bags of that). Each bag feeds more than the recommended 4 pax (that or we are small eaters). Dungeness or Brown Crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, and corn are tossed with a sauce of your choice. For the sauce, there's garlic butter (for the kiddos), pepper butter (for amateurs), mild, medium and raging spice. Of the lot, i thought that the mild worked the best. It was more savory than the bland and boring garlic butter, but not too spicy to give you a heartburn or mar the taste of the seafood. Of the ingredients in the bag, I loved the succulent and juicy prawns, the salty chorizo style sausages, and not to mention the sweet corn! The juicy kernels provided a respite from the spices after a while. Get a lobster ($49) to go with your meal! Same price as Pince and Pints but without the queue (just make a reservation)! I liked this better than the crabs. Lemon butter was a good choice as the sauce is lighter and simpler, which allowed the freshness of the lobster to come through. The pepper butter can be rather overwhelming with spice in my opinion and not quite suitable for this meat.If you're not up for a seafood feasting, you could also do smaller meals such as fish and chips, chicken and waffles, and hot dogs as well. For desserts, we had the Molten Lava cake ($9.90) which remained fairly decent even after all the photo taking. The almond (mocha?) ice cream with Oreo crunch was a hit with us. Skip the fried banana and durian fritters ($7.90) with salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It sounded way more exotic than it tasted and certainly not quite worth the price for fried pisang. Plus it had a stale oily taste.We really enjoyed our meal while it lasted. It was fun passing food around with our bare hands and letting loose at the dining table. However, the gastric reflux was pretty severe and the garlic aftertaste lingered long after the meal concluded. In fact, it's pretty nauseating thinking about it right now. So yes, it's a once in a blue moon indulgence for us. That said, I'd certainly recommend The Boiler for a gathering with family and friends! What's your favorite seafood boil?"

I didn't think it'd be that crowded but boy was I wrong. For a restaurant located in the middle of an industrial zone, on a Sunday night, this place was PACKED. When we got there every table was full, and the nearest roadside parking was two streets down. Surprising, to say the least.But hey, free parking on Sundays and after 5pm (I think) on weekdays means that despite its inaccessibility, it's quite worth driving in!We were a large group of 10 people, so we got to order a fairly broad range of items. We ordered two of their bags (feeds four each), one mildly spicy, one garlic butter. We ordered a lobster (medium spicy) because it was on offer, and plenty of sides. Seafood first.For $140+ per bag, it's good value. You get something like a whole crab, 6-8 pieces of prawns (maybe more, I wasn't counting), sausage, corn, mussels, clams, and some fried buns. The sauces are good too. The garlic butter was buttery rich and very garlicky. My only criticism is that by the time you're reaching the end of the bag, it's really heavy going. Conversely, the spicy sauces are less flavourful when you start out, but so much cleaner and lighter on the palate that you can keep going for longer. Mild spice is pretty disappointing for someone with the average Singaporean spice tolerance. I highly recommend medium. The corn in the bag was good, sweet and not overcooked. The crabs weren't the freshest I'd ever had, but they were still sweet and tasty.I wouldn't bother recommending the lobsicles, which are bite-sized bits of deep fried lobster, despite their fame. There's just nothing special about them. The Momma's Potato Scoops are basically just wedges served with cheese sauce, and the Spam Fries are spammier than most places. Not as crisp as they could have been either. The coleslaw was average, fresh tasting, but it felt very odd eating coleslaw by hand. I also feel the Jamaican alcoholic ginger beer is worth special mention. The alcohol taste is light, the ginger taste strong, and it's a great drink if you love ginger beer in general. (Though it's a bit sweet)The best part of the entire meal was really that, drinks included, everything came out to only $70 per person. Considering the amount we ate? Definitely worth it.

You have been warned!*Pros* The food is decent. The taste of the seafood in a bag is definitely cajun, and well marinated with the works. One whole bag (I can't remember which one I got) had enough crabs, prawns, mussels, cockles, corn and sausages enough for two to share. We also had the boston lobster (the price was on special!) marinated in garlic butter. The mid-joint wings was also pretty decent!*Cons* Missing mallets! Mallets would be helpful, especially for the lobsters! And perhaps extra wet-wipes and napkins? How about putting a kitchen roll at the table?And what happened to the root beer? Cajun-style seafood dinners demand either beer, or root beer if you are driving... And I was driving. The waitress told us that they used to carry root beer, but stopped due to low demand. She also told us a few things were no longer on the menu due to pricing costs, including the every popular lobster-sicle. Recommended: The Works Sauce, no matter what seafood you are getting! The bags are good value.The removal of some essential items that make it a truly Louisiana experience was pretty sad, as I have experienced  authentic US cajun before and unfortunately this was a derivative of the actual thing. But more importantly, which I hope the owners can probably read this, is that the marinade could possibly use a little stronger taste. The seafood is well marinated, but the cajun flavor I feel wasn't strong enough.Overall, knowing that the restaurant is new, I'll give them a thumbs up for their effort, and hope that they can improve the authenticity and overall feel of southern-style seafood!"

Good was delicious and semi-healthy (not fried or overloaded with sugar). The food was served quickly and the lack of plates made for an interesting dining experience. One may be hesitant to dig in and get their hands dirty but this is a good ol American styled prawn feast... you just gotta get in there.

Reminiscent of the great Boiling crab joint in States. Seafood is fresh and the Dungeness crab is delicately sweet. The large succulent Prawns are definitely our favourite among all the fresh seafood. The works sauce is spicy and umami!! Will probably be one of our regular seafood joint going forward.

""The works"" is the sauce here which is comparable to ""the whole shabang "" at the boiling crab. But the Pepper Butter sauce here is simply outstanding! It's a must try. The service staff are friendly and accommodating. They even offer you a plastic sleeve for your handphone in case you need to answer a call while your hands are covered in sauce... And yes , you need to use both your hands for a wholesome experience! The bib provided is clear plastic so it's not Selfie friendly but it gets the job done though. A wonderful place to hangout with friends and family. The beverage list is not bad , they have fruity refreshing beers and a wine selection too. To top it all off would be ""The Molten chocolate lava cake""! With a soothing cup of coffee! Bon Appetite!"

It's located at the first floor of McPherson community centre, and utilises their wifi. It's very spacious, and it's even got a small slide in the corner for kids to play in. I wasn't that hungry, and ended up ordering their truffle fries and their laksa pizza, along with a 'matcha Kopi'.Their menu is pretty extensive and locally inspired, including things like a Chili crab pasta and a salted egg yolk prawn pasta. They also do burgers and pizzas. The laksa pizza I had was interesting conceptually, consisting of their own homemade bread topped with prawns, fishcake, curry leaves and boiled egg. I enjoyed it as it was a thin crust, but honestly it felt more like a glorified bakery bread. It wasn't bad, but at $16.90, it's a little steep. As for the truffle fries, the truffles it was topped with were questionable. However, I have to admit that I really like the layout, and it's very communal. The staff need some work in terms of explaining the menu, but otherwise, I actually really liked the coffee! They also do a salted caramel latte, so next time I might try it. They're apparently famous for their rainbow cake, which looked really delectable, and topped with things like cookies and cream and salted caramel. Overall, seems like a good place to do some studying and work if you're in the area, though more for coffee and dessert than the food, which is a tad overpriced. Might try their pasta next time! Definitely a good concept to put it in a CC, I'll have to come back again and update my review then, with photos of the rainbow cake!"

NOM's interior is set up with several square tables so they can be very flexible with any party size. A great plus point over fixed sized booths, which only accomodate so many people. This is the entrance of NOM at MacPherson Community Club on a tuesday night 8pm. I parked across the street, at the HDB car park and there was a summon aunty walking around checking coupons, so do take note! Cheese and tomato pizza was okay, nothing fancy. Big enough to share. For the kids meal, we got pasta and the gravy tasted fine, except for the pasta penne itself, it was abit hard. Their chicken leg was done pretty decently and the meat pretty much fell off the bone and you wouldn't need a knife to eat this cleanly. So thumbs up for this.I liked it better when they served full portobellos. For $9.90, this is literally one or at most two portobello mushroom caps sliced up, breaded and fried. Totally a rip off.Everyone loved the ribs, even though I found it a bit too hard, there was only one bone in there though. So tons of meat for sharing.Being that this is my second time, I figured I knew what I wanted. But I was so wrong, the quality has dropped. I am not sure if I would be back for the rosti. Refer to my previous review in SEPT/OCT and see the pictures of the Rosti, it looks so different. I even feedbacked to the young waitress whom politely asked if I wanted the Rosti recooked, but I said, forget it, my friends had already dug into it. But even my friend who came in JB, mentioned that Marches' Rosti is so much better and even cheaper than this. So, the newest addition to NOM is their rainbow cheesecakes which I did not see in September. It is quite solid, so I know for sure there's at least 2 blocks of Philadelphia cream cheese in there or more. It can be quite gerlat, so do share it, so just eat it and run 10km at the gym the next day.I had tried their chocolate and oreo rainbow cakes before and this was my first time trying their salted caramel cake. Everyone really liked the salted caramel rainbow cake smile And some of my friends mentioned that they would be back to try other cakes, definitely not the Rosti though. At $8.90 a slice, rainbow cakes here aren't cheap but they're at least decent. The Rainbow cakes were priced at $7.90 a slice just 2 months ago.. :(I'm glad that NOM is sensible enough to price this rainbow cheesecake at $7.90, one dollar less than the rainbow cake itself. Being that I do bake cakes, I also know well that a rainbow cheesecake takes ALOT less time to make than a normal rainbow buttercream/sponge cake.The best upside to NOM is that it is nett priced, but I believe their prices seem to be going up some dumb reason."

It wasn't too crowded, there was just another family there with us. My first impression of the place was that it was bare and clinical, with the stark white walls, cement floor and white tables and chairs. It felt.. cold. The mandopop music played through the speakers made me feel even more like an outsider.I would say the food was average. We had the atlanta eggs benedict, blackstone eggs benedict, truffle fries and chocolate rainbow cake. Let's start with the best part- the cake. We got it only because it's supposedly the thing you must try if you're there. I've never been a fan of rainbow cake because they don't really taste like rainbows (cheat my feelings, you know?), but I'm glad I tried this one. The sponge was moist, fluffy and full of flavour, even without the chocolate icing. The icing was decadent - rich, creamy chocolatey goodness that melts in your mouth (and in your hands, I checked). The truffle fries were amazing as fries, not so much as truffle fries. They were actually cut potatoes and I believe they were air-fried or baked, so they were not greasy. The fries were crispy on the surface and hot on the inside. Unfortunately, we could barely taste the truffles. In terms of taste, the shaved parmesan on top had more impact.The poached eggs were not that great, to be honest. They were almost cold by the time they were served, and one out the 4 was not runny in the middle. Toasting the english muffins and grilling the tomatoes would have improved the dishes, i think.In summary, as NOM is quite out of the way for those who don't live in Macpherson, I think I'd need a stronger reason to go back. The cakes are definitely tempting, so i'd stop by for those if i'm nearby."

Went on a Friday and surprisingly full in the late night. Many were here for the pretty rainbow cakes with assorted creams. Today is the oreo and salted caramel cream. The former is a little dry and the latter a bit too caramel sweet. But its a decent rainbow cake. not overly creamy and the colors of the layers are impressively bright. Not the best rainbow cake I ate (as of now i have tried like A LOT of them) but its up there with a couple of my faves.Savories - sweet potato fries were well done. could have a little more powdered sugar. Truffle Parmesan Fries - alright. The half and half pizza is served in its rectangular form and the crust is thin and filled with herbs (think foccacia bread). an interesting take with the pepperoni and mushroomwith arugula. Overall not a bad pizza. The crust saved the dish.Drinks - as a coffee and chocolate lover I went for the latte which is small and decent (my girlies beg to differ, so you guys try it and let me know). I was attracted to the chocolate drinks especially with african red hot chocolate and chilli hot chocolate in the list. so we ordered them. THEY WERE NOT HOT. Lukewarm at best. *sad face. But the chilli chocolate had that spicy punch after a sip. so that was the saving grace of that. The african red chocolate had nothing to rescue it from its sad lukewarm (and by now cold) state. *sigh The service staff are friendly and one was really honest to let me and my girlies know it was her first day. Not very proactive but attentive when called. So overall not bad. a very young team of girls.For an estate like Macpherson to have such a cafe really brings a twist to the feel of the place. Will come back again to try the other things like their mains, all day breakkies (weekends only hor) and their non cake desserts. Oh they have interesting cheesecakes too. Overall a very good cafe with quality food and a passionate service team. Come here before it gets popular!"
