I thought we were going to take the shuttle to the Heartland Mall (Kovan MRT station) to have lunch then go to this chocolate factory that the folks here keep mentioning but Sheng Teck took us to a new spot to eat, directly across from this chocolate factory. It was like all the other hawker centers I have been to but somewhat cleaner. As always, I find myself pondering what to eat every time because there are so many choices. Luckily, we found a table so I suggested for the 2 guys to grab their food first whilst I hold the table. Little did I know, I did not have to order any food for myself. As I was in line for some rice, roasted pork and char siu, Sheng Teck came up to me to tell me that he ordered enough food for him and I. Awwww, right? That guy literally stole my heart. + the rice was fluffy + portions are quite generous + the roasted pork was super tender + the BBQ pork was succulent + the roasted chicken melted in my mouth He also ordered something else for Jerry and I to try. I had no clue what it was but I tried it and feel like I deserve a medal for trying something I definitely was hesitant about, haha. The food was great. The best was my company. Both guys have a very special place in my heart. Thanks to this trip. I am so grateful. Thank you for treating, Sheng Teck :)"

The menu is filled with lots of hearty German fare, from sausages to schnitzel. We split a garlic sausage with sauerkraut and potato salad, and we were impressed! The sausage was juicy, and the sauerkraut complemented the creaminess of the potato salad.I was a little surprised that they didn't offer any soft pretzels as an option for appetizers; if they could do that I think it would make this place even better.

However the order was served with spaghetti by a apologetic staff saying they had no fettucini. Not too impressed with such poor service as they should ask customer first before preparing the meal. Too hungry to reject the order and wait for them to prepare something else so i took it  The mushrooms are not fresh mushroom but are instead canned button mushrooms. Beef is overcooked and tough. The sauce was salty but its expected cos its cheese.  I will stick to pies and pastries if i patronise them again the next time

I have to say my father has great taste (not only in finding a wife) - this is DA BEST fish-head steamboat in Singapore. Regardless of your choice of white pomfret or the red grouper, the pre-fried fish is always succulent and fresh, cooked to perfection in the full-flavoured soup. I remember as a kid I liked to select the half-soggy yam pieces from the soup, those were my favourite. The tofu prawn is a recommended side order. Its sauce is a different take with a little bit of spice, but it helps the rice to go down really well.Many people are willing to wait for these piping pots of steamy goodness, that's why we always make it a point to reach before dinner time.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews."

I have to say that that's pretty good for any country standards.Although the place says that it's a tapas bar, there is a fairly limited tapas menu, and not that exciting. But I have to say that the fried risotto is pretty fabulous. Their normal food menu, which are all full sized dishes, are all good. The pasta dishes are well cooked and are tasty. The pizza is a bit on the dry side, but good. This is really the place to come if you want to share a bottle of wine with your friends (or maybe just with yourself.)

So, look out for these offers if you're in an economical state of mind.

It has a really nice menu with decent food and wine at reasonable prices, which is a recipe for success in an area like Katong/Joo Chiat. It's flabbergasting how many other similar venues failed in this neighborhood because they didn't get the price/quality balance right, and Wine Connection has to be commended for not assuming that just because there's more expats living here, there's a market for European food at 30+ dollars a dish, and wine at 15+ dollars a glass.They do a lot of things right, from, again, reasonable prices for reasonable food and wine, to a pretty well done interior that gives the right ambiance, to - finally - reasonably late opening hours, something unheard of in this still pathetically early closing neighbourhood! Yes everyone else on east coast road and Joo Chiat, are you listening? If you want to ever become the Holland Village of the east, last order at 9:30 won't cut it.Now, to my biggest, and only issue with Wine Connection, which is a total deal breaker: the noise. This place is popular, and generally quite full, and the interior architect who was responsible for making this place look trendy-hip seems to have gone to great lengths to carefully choose materials that are sure to create the absolute maximum possible reverb, with everyone's voices bouncing off tiled floor, glass/concrete walls, making this place about as loud as the runway at Changi. Having dinner with spouse becomes an eternal 'say again' match, unless you're willing to join in with everyone else and scream your voice hoarse.Wine Connection would be an easy 4 star, but unless the noise is addressed - and it's not so hard, use fabric on the ceiling and it will be much better - it's a 3."

Giving it 4 stars for the following reasons:1. Food quality: They are well known for their tonkatsu sets and they don't disappoint. Their tonkatsu sets are delicious and one of the better ones that you can find in SG. Love their black and white sesame seeds which I always have fun grounding into powder form. Add some yuzu sauce to the grounded sesame and it becomes a perfect dip for the katsu, enhancing its taste tremendously. The tartar sauce that they serve is also really delicious and they will readily give you 2nd helpings if you ask for them.2. Free flow of shredded Cabbage: They are very generous with their shredded cabbage and the wait staff will come round to top up for you again and again. Gotta ask them to stop as one just cannot eat that much cabbage. The sesame and yuzu sauce go very well with the cabbage, making it a really refreshing side dish which helps to balance the taste of the meat dishes.3. Service: Service is friendly, adequate and pretty efficient. Probably a 3.5 stars for service overall.4. People Watching and Admiring Art in motion: The seats are comfortable, especially when you can get the booth seats. If you are seated at the booth seats, you can have a meal while enjoying the action - watching folks checking in at the airline counters at the departure hall below. I always try to get the booth seats and have been lucky to get them in all my past visits. It is also really fun to watch the very impressive art installation Kinetic Rain while dining here.Really into sake (especially hot sake) recently. So, would definitely be returning to Saboten to satisfy my cravings for hot sake and mouth-watering tonkatsu quite soon."

I ordered the pork loin on rice curry set. The panko on the pork and the pork itself were cooked really well. It was nice and crispy on the outside with a perfect color and the pork was nice and juicy and not at all oily. The curry was an average mild curry. I wish there was an option for a hot/spicy curry.

I headed down for dinner with the family and ordered more dishes to try.For starters, their ebi is still good at this branch. In fact, so good that my mum had seconds. I like that their prawns was melt in your mouth which adds a nice balance to the crispy batter. The tonkatsu was less than fantastic at this branch which is quite a shame since that was what I really raved about. The bits of oily skin inside which made it rather gross. I thought the one at Millenia Walk was done better with firmer meat to batter ratio and no skin in the cutlet. Tried the mentai cutlet, thought that was okay, nothing to write home about so stick to their original sets. The rice was fluffy and fragrant with fresh shredded cabbages that I love to pair with their sesame sauce. Icecream was the same though in a smaller scoop but that's no biggie. Service is just as polite but I just wished it was easier to get their attention since the service at Milennia Walk's branch was outstanding.

If you like it slightly wet, stocked in rich stock, this Hokkien Mee will work for you. I liked that they pair the yellow noodles with thin vermicelli (most places use thick vermicelli). You get more flavour and less starchy, plus the dish does not dry up as easily and you can enjoy the rich prawn broth with every bite! All the seafood added into the dish was cooked for the right bite so you don't have to worry about rubbery seafood.This is good even for takeaway, the Hokkien Mee stays wet from the rich broth."

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.A must dish is the local meal called ""Oluak"" aka oyster omelette from Green Sky food stall, which is one of the best you'll have in the whole of Singapore for my liking, which not only has generous servings of oysters but also their unique way of cooking it up and the textures are very different that the run of the mill ones, in that it's super crispy and crunchy.From the same stall, you can get a pretty good Char Kway Teow which is usually some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and although it wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.The usual satay store that we frequent was sold out by the time we arrived but the one we ate at Stall 11 Ayam Penyet (which translates to ""flat chicken"") didn't disappoint either and the mutton was full of flavour and and these segments of fat that were sweet and so more-ish. If you don't like fat, pass the satay stick on to someone that does. The sauce was nice too but like it's hard to find a bad pizza or bagel in New York, the same can be said for satay but be aware that there are many variations, depending upon the specific influences and regions grounding the chef.For dessert we had our traditional fare of Ais Kacang aka Ice Kacang and Cendol. Ice Kacang is basically shaved ice with flavourings of rose syrup and Gula Melaka (palm sugar) and the kacang part which is usually seaweed grass jelly and red beans and inevitably has attap chee or palm seeds and corn adorning the top. When you go to a beverage shop, they will usually serve hot and cold drinks as well as the refreshing ice kacang but it's almost like a Sizzler smorgasbord in that you can pick and choose what goes into your ice kacang. The cendol looks like little green worms but taste far from it and are sweet rice flour noodles coloured an iridescent green and often paired with coconut.Overall it has to be good if we keep going back there. There's definitely better Kway Teow for my tastes in town but the food stalls at Bedok Corner have yet to disappoint."

The Fried Prawn Mee is stewed in a rich stock, and holds a relatively strong taste of lard. Ye Lai Xiang, possibly the most famous stall there, occupies 2 stall spaces.

The brown sauce is not as spicy as I'd like it to be, but, good enough for that shiok factor. The crushed peanuts adds a good texture to this very satisfying dish. 2. Chicken rice at Tong Fong Fatt*I'm a Muslim so I have not eaten much authentic non-halal hainanese chicken rice*I've always preferred the hainanese chicken rice over the Malay chicken rice as the latter tends to be greasy with almost everything fried. This plate of chicken rice from TFF is amazing - rice is fragrant and fluffy, the steamed chicken is soft and succulent (you have a choice of roasted or steamed), the soup is alright and the garlic chilli adds a nice balance to the whole dish."

He was pouring huge pots of drinks while also taking peoples orders which was very mesmerizing and impressive. It wasn't all for show either because the teh was delicious! Actually, everything was good. We got the classics: curry noodles, nasi lemak and kaya toast. The two entrees also came with a slice of cake each so I got the Kaya and kopi flavors. The kaya one was my favorite!! Super thick buttercream and not too sweet. I came back again when flying out of the airport and tried their mee reebus which was also very tasty - it's like curry gravy.

Eating there is also much more peaceful compared to the hubbub of the food court just down the hall.3.5/5 Food: My first time stopping by, I ordered the chicken donburi. It didn't taste anything remotely Japanese. It was more like a bland version of a Hong Kong chicken clay pot dish.My second time, I ordered the sashimi bento box and I liked that so much better. It came with 6 slices of sashimi, rice, miso soup, fruit, okra, and salad. Tbh, not the best sashimi I've had, but it was a simple and filling meal, so I left happy.4/5 Service: Multi-lingual servers who are attentive but not intrusive.Overall, definitely not the best Asian food I've ever had, but for airport food, it's not bad at all."

It worked well with me but may not for others who prefer thicker soups. I also had the Truffle Capellini with organic egg. It was delicious, with the truffle not overwhelming and just right. The egg was a good mix with the capellini. As for my partner, she had the mussels with spicy cream.

Bar Stories deserves a post of it's own - it's one of the most unique and memorable bars that I've visited, in any of the cities that I've lived in. It's sister outlet, Table Manners, has a unique selling point - the creativity of Bar Stories combined with the coffee crafting expertise of Papa Palheta. This would be a potent combination in any part of Singapore, but particularly so in an area that until recently had been starved of quality coffee. As always, I ordered an espresso and a cappuccino, two drinks that tell me a lot about the quality of coffee in any given cafe, bar or restaurant. The espresso shot was thick, with definite hints of citrus. This gave rise to a full bodied aftertaste that lingered long after the last drops of espresso had been gulped down. It seemed thicker and more potent than a regular shot - more akin to a ristretto - this was a shot that was extracted for the correct eighteen to thirty second extraction time. This may seem like a minor point, but it's an important one - it's harder to make bad coffee with a good espresso foundation.The shot had a medium dark crema, which lined the side of the cup. It's interesting to note that a lot of the perceived bitterness in an espresso shot comes from the crema itself. If you carefully scoop the crema from a fresh espresso shot, it should taste extremely tart. Crema which clings to the side of a cup will not impart as much of this sharp flavour to a shot. This was a good shot by any standard, but it would also be a good shot for anyone who has not tried espresso shots before, or for anyone who has been turned off espresso by bad shots in franchise chain cafes.    The cappuccino has a thin layer of foam, closer to that seen on a latte. As a result, the smooth and silky mouthfeel was reduced, making this a lighter cappuccino (I prefer mine stronger), but the quality of the drink was not overly diminished. One issue is that teacups are being used rather than coffee cups - the difference being that tea cups have very thin walls, and as a result, heats dissipates much more quickly (I'm a science geek. I can't help but notice these things). Combined with the overhead fans above, coffees can lose heat quite quickly, and this has a significant effect on the quality of coffee served. It's worth pointing out that coffees in Table Manners are no more expensive than those in franchise chains. Why waste good money on bad coffee when Table Manners has Papa Palheta's beans? However, prices on the take away menu need to be updated. A latte is listed as costing $5, but actually costs $5.90 - this should be an easy thing to fix, but it's still there. Latte art is always a welcome sight, as it tells me that the baristas were trained to a high standard, and trained to care about quality coffee. This is consistent with my comments on the espresso shot being prepared correctly. The light dusting of cocoa powder ensured that little sweetness was imparted, and that the cocoa flavour accentuated rather than dominated the drink.The food menu is worth a mention also - there is a good selection of starters, main courses and deserts, and an interesting menu that allows items to be paired according to the customers preferences. The prices are fair - they are certainly not overpriced - another point in their favour.In a nutshell, the bright young staff at Table Manners are serving up quality coffee, made from quality beans in a quirky and interesting bar and restaurant. Bar Stories younger sibling is already off to a good start....but change the cups and update the prices on the take away menu!"

I ordered the set lunch with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, salad, and strawberry shortcake.When my order arrived, they had given me mushrooms instead of potatoes.  I brought it to the servers attention.  He took my plate away and quickly returned.  They had simply added maybe two spoons worth of mashed potatoes to my plate.  Come on, potatoes are one of the least expensive foods in the world and, after making a mistake on my order, they skimp on them.The fried chicken was pretty good.  It was certainly not the traditional fried chicken that I kind of expected.  It was prepared more like chicken fried steak. It was a large boneless piece of chicken pounded out, breaded and fried.   It was nothing to write home about but I liked it.tinyurl.com/93wn6a2The strawberry shortcake was a fresh, light, and refreshing dessert.tinyurl.com/96shz52Overall, this is a basic place.  It is much like the restaurants next to it (Moa and Lavaedge).  It is not an inexpensive lunch.  But, it doesn't empty your wallet either.  Out of convenience (close to work), I might go back.  However, it is definitely not a place to venture out of your way to visit."

I almost lost my way in the mall while trying to locate TM. Without any visible signage and especially difficult when the mall has quite a number of small exits around. I don't seem to be able to spot the restaurant until I reached the open space - a small garden-like area. There, I saw a black outdoor gazebo dining area with an open counter featuring a prominent ""pigeon-hole"" backdrop. I knew I have found it and walk right up. I was greeted by a zealous wait staff at the door, who explained the ordering instructions patiently and thereafter showed me to the indoor seats.Entering the dining hall, it is the democratic design that I saw. I could imagine how the people behind TM conceptualized the area, decking out in modernistic Scandinavia-inspired furniture characterized by simplicity and practicality. The ""piecemeal"" communal table stood out from the space, without looking cluttered. The area was highlighted by the wall shelving with potted plants, retail pieces stuffed in each pigeon holes. Fitted mostly in pressed wood, the room was made less formal with a sense of nature integration. The first thing that comes to mind is Ikea, this group of Swedish makes really sensible tools with a small price tag.Lunch is served in a mix-and-match manner, where it comes with 4 main categories; ""fibers"" - Staples & Vegetables, ""protein"" - Seafood & Meat. You can choose to have the lightest meal with 3 fibers for $9.50 or the hearty combination of 2 fiber and 2 protein for $19.00. of course, if these ain't going to fill you, get some add-ons and pay additional $3.50 - $7.50. I customized my plate with a mid-sized combo plus 1 add-on & a dessert to end the meal.The lightly salted Truffle fries are so addictive that I can't stop but emptied the bowl within a short 10 minutes. Each string was deep fried to crisp and I liked the fact that they are cut fatter than any shoe-strings yet sliced slimmer than the regular straight fries. Smell of comfort, less gasoline taste - a great snack packed in umami-rich aromas. Go for potato wedges if truffle fries seem less idolizing.The Chopped Pumpkin Salad came with a decent portion of fresh greens. Never mind if the diced pumpkin looks miserable, a generous toss of that tangy salad dressing add scores to the boring greens. I was looking for a sweet flavour in the pumpkin but the morsels were too tiny to taste.The Cajun seasoning lends a sweet and spicy scent to the sizable chicken thigh. One incision and you witnessed how moist and tender the meat was roasted, with the bursting juices oozing out onto the plate. It was quite close to what I have eaten at Amuse, a delicious piece of bird meat. Other ""protein"" like beef stroganoff, pork cutlet, pesto fish fillet and burger steak, are available as well. There's nothing you won't choose.That additional fiber I had - Spaghetti Pomodoro akin tomato sauce was equally tasty. The pasta had a good boil, yielding a springy bit but it will be perfect if it was cooked Al dente. Every strand was coated in the mildly acidic tomato sauce, fair amount of concentrate yet not overly seasoned. Sometimes when I am really unlucky, I get some bad tasting pasta that either comes with a chunk of soggy noodles or a pool of unpalatable watery sauce. Here, no slipshod piece of work seen.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/t…What is a complete meal without a sweet ending? You've guess it! A chocolate-caramel war. Undoubtedly, the sweet course didn't come cheap, ranging from $6.50 - $7.50. But I am willing to foot the price if it tastes divine. I am split between a Strawberry Shortcake and the chocolate tart. In the end, the latter succeeded in talking me over. Fabulous piece of tart. The shortcrust crumbles neatly on my plate each time I forked right through. The highlight was that chilled chocolate fillings - soft and chewy. The cocoa flavour was explosive, so intense. Each mouthful was gooey when the chocolate fused with that sticky caramel substance in the middle. Flavour becomes good when it has a lot of layering and this Sea Salt Chocolate Caramel Tart depicts that - speechless.Coffee addict will not leave TM without a good Papa Palheta dose. The potion was rich, aromatic, not acrid - truly a stimulant. Not a fan on coffee? How about a cup of tea from Tea Forte? And if you are in the mood for some cocktails, they have the so-called popular drinks from Bar Stories presented in 5 groupings, that is, sweet, spicy, sour, bitter, and intriguingly to chill you.Though lesser known by diners, you could pick up anything from this retail-cum-cafe that fits a housewarmin"

Almost every dish was below expectations considering the prices. The only exception was the mushroom soup that came with the set.

There's some suggested combinations if you want to know what goes together, otherwise you can take a punt and hope they all go together. I got the salmon with a side of broccoli and mixed vegetables. I need greenery and this sounded like a healthy option. Sadly the vegetables came slathered in butter/oil and the salmon had a creamy dressing on top. It tasted fine but my tastebuds certainly weren't delighted. Next time I'll choose my combo more carefully.What I really loved about Table Manners was the fitout. I love the interior of this place - kind of like a Scandinavian library feel (not that I have any idea what the libraries look like in Scandinavia). There's free wifi and a chilled vibe, so it's also the perfect place to sit for a while if you need to have a meeting or do some work."

It's not trying to do too much, and with what they do do, they do it well.Our gang of six had a couple of different options, and all of us polished out plates - the truffle capellini had great flavour, and that yolk seemd to bind the flavours together, while my Louisiana fried chicken was not so much Southern, yet a very well battered and fried chop, so I didn't really have a lot to complain about. With very reasonable prices and a daily three-hour happy hour deal, you'll find a reason to come back."

If you want a little more intimacy, then you can opt to sit at the row of tables at a corner of the room. Outdoor seating is in a bird cage like gazebo just outside the restaurant.Onto the food. Enjoyable and hearty western cuisine. I was eyeing the Angus beef steak with truffle fries but it was sold out. Had the pork cutlet with aioli which was quite good. Very juicy and tasty. The baked salmon also won the boy's vote with its flavorful sauce. Drinks are from Bar stories, a sister company of Table Manners! There's happy hour from 5-8pm every day. Awesome!!

Started 2 sides (crusted oysters and baby squid calamari) while waiting for our 3 mains (platter combo, seafood spaghetti, seafood & chicken jambalaya). The pork ribs are tender and slides off the bones. Hubby loved the Cajun sauce. The other mains are only so-so. The guys are still not full and ordered the spicy wings and other portion of the baby squid calamari. The spicy wings are using the Cajun sauce again so hubby is thrilled again. (Although one of my guests think it's too spicy). The baby squid calamari is a favorite that we had to order a second portion. Apparently this dish is a sneak preview and will be introduced next year. Overall, the taste is decent. Although, I can't agree with the other reviews that the price is value for money."

It was one of his favorite dishes so I thought it was worth giving it a try. Bak Ku Teh (Pork rib soup) is one of the signature dishes of Singapore. You'll find that breakfast is somewhat of a liberal concept here- - it goes beyond just pancakes and eggs. If it's served in the morning, there's no reason it can't be breakfast. No one will look twice as you're devouring a hearty bowl of pork ribs for your morning nourishment.PORK RIB SOUPThe soup was peppery, garlicky and served piping hot. The pork ribs were fall off the bone-tender. A side of Youtiao (Chinese Donut) is great for dipping into the broth after you've finished the ribs. While the soup had a good kick it was unfortunately, just ok. SPICY PORK BELLYBraised pork belly served in a clay pot was tender however, a bit dry and too sweet. I found the chili infused soy sauce helped balanced out the sweetness but didn't do much for the dish overall. If I'm being honest, this is a pass for me. While this particular meal wasn't anywhere near my favorite, the soup would be best eaten when it's cold out."

PRAWN PANCAKE- Deep fried prawns with a thin crispy exterior was tasty. PORK CHOP FRIED RICE- The pork chops were well seasoned over the fragrant rice was superb.

Came across this place and menu looked good so we went in. The item which I hadn't experienced before was a little holder for my bag. It made for sitting at a little table better as I didn't have to balance my bag and I didn't have to hang it on the back of my chair. Clever. We ordered one of the steamed truffle and pork dumpling - a wee little thing which cost $5. I didn't want to order five in case we didn't enjoy it. My son chose the chicken dumplings. The food took a while to come and we were starving by then. The truffle dumpling was definitely worth it. I wish we had ordered more as it was better than the chicken dumplings. It features black truffles with fresh pork wrapped in the dumpling skin. And included rice broth in it so the liquid burst into your mouth when you bit into the dumpling. Delicious. We also had wontons and fried rice. Those were yummy too. Would go back next time we get a chance to visit Singapore.

Love the juicy succulent patty that is contrasted by the sharp special sauce. My favorite has got to be their breakfasts though. I would compare the portion to Jones', slightly smaller but this is half the price of what you pay there. Value for money or what? Lots used to do meats so the sausages are good. Looks a bit on the thin side but it's juicy and fragrant. The blueberry pancakes are fluffy and moist on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. I love the pancakes because they are not overly thick. I don't usually take pancakes because the taste gets boring after a while. Tried different pancakes from WH, Prive etc but i never liked them. FfT's is not bad but this is better. Go for blueberry, it's not as dry as the others.  The iced mocha is also one of the better ones i've had. I would put this after Jones' (or at the same spot).

Very fresh.Deep fried prawns in beancurd skin is nice and fresh.Hotplate otah is nice.Tong po rou could be softer.Sambal kang kong is nice.

We decided to check it out as none of us have been there although it seemed to be a popular seafood restaurant in Simpang Bedok. They are super packed and even provide valet services as parking is limited here.I am very intrique by the wall of crab shells graffti that their customers have left behind. Tucked away in the east, we tried some of their popular dishes like the salted egg crabs and the KL hokkein mee, pretty yummy and we were not disappointed. Definitely worth coming back and checking out their other dishes. I love how the management at this chain restaurants name their chain stores pretty catchy. This particular one is call big eater seafood, they have the other outlets by the name of Grand Eater  and Master Crab."

The crabs are firm and fresh, though the experts will tell you not to order when the moon is full or something like that. The salted egg yolk crab is better than the chili, while he KL hokkien mee is a happy heart attack on a plate; a mess of black stringy noodles and liberally sprinkled with lard. Oh so good.

This explains the long lines that snake past the store every lunchtime on the weekdays and throughout the day on the weekends - I would say that they are un-rivalled in the east. Although always busy, the owners take the time to get every order perfect, with give you the part of the chicken that you prefer if it is available. As it is a small store with only 2 or 3 people working in it, and with a high demand, prepare to wait for your chicken rice - I had to wait in line for about 20 minutes the last time I went, but it was worth it :)"

They have so many different stalls that offer at least 4-25 or so options each. It took me a long time to decide and I didn't even get the chance to check out everything.Saw the noodle soup and my eyes got fixated. I had the combination noodle soup, with a side of fried jumbo fish ball. The food looks better than it tastes. The noodle soup could use more salt, and the fish ball could use a better dipping sauce too. Overall, I was a little disappointed, but still enjoyed the food. The biggest win was the freshly juiced mango and guava cup that I had. It was so good I would have gotten another one (and try more food) if I wasn't already running late for my connection flight.Overall, don't let the overall rating scare you off.

When you reach the entrance of the food court, there are a couple of sign boards that tells you to purchase a card as the stalls doesn't accept cash payment. Doesn't make sense for foreigners and in fact it's inconvenient. Why? You have to queue up twice - to purchase the card and seek a refund for it (or you can keep it), but for those who don't like collecting cards, refunding it for cash is probably the option. Why not allow cash payment at the counters instead? The prices of the food are overpriced, but what do you expect at airports, it's usually like that everywhere. I had the chicken rice ($6.50) and it's average, not really to my liking. For those on stop-overs, it's good to have a taste of Singaporean food, I guess that's the purpose of this food court.

If you load too much money, they'll give refunds, but only in SGD.  The one thing I wanted, which was Hainan chicken rice, was CLOSED.  Sad face.  I settled for the roast duck and roast pork plate and shared the combination dry noodle with with my friend.  The food looks so amazing in the photos, but were pathetic when they served the dish on the counter.  The portions were only 50% of what was pictured and the quality left more to be desired. If you're laying over in the airport and are super desperate to get a taste of Singapore food, I guessssss you could eat here.  Otherwise, stay away."

I had the pulled duck macaroni which was made with 3 different types of cheese. Satisfying but a bit filling for one given the generous amounts of cheese heaped on the macaroni. My partner had the salted egg yolk pasta, which was cutely served in a jar. Didn't try it but she enjoyed it. Both our meals were served with a small side salad that was drizzled with wasabi teriyaki sauce. Couldn't appreciate the peculiar flavour but to each his own! :)Topped up $2 for earl grey tea and $5 for a jar cake"

YOU WILL SEE ANOTHER COFFEE BEAN!! and right next to it, fart tartz cafe!! :) It is a cute cafe, with sofa seats, high bar counter top seats too.. and the bloom tarts :D They're soo cute, although they looked bigger on photos, they're actually palm sized. We ordered a matcha and a oreo nutella one, based on the shops' recommendation. at $5.50 nett, I can't complain too much. It was fun to cam whore with the ""potted plants"" and you get to keep the fake flower.. hurray for my mother! and we dug in!! :) the matcha was light and you could still taste the green tea flavour. The oreo nutella was a winner, I mean.. who doesn't like nutella? it's a winner on it's own.. at the bottom of the flower pot, there is a an actual chunk of the oreo, with the cream filling.. :) all in all a nice treat.. although I wouldn't bother taking 1hr 40 mins worth of train rides just for this.. but if you are in the area, do give it a try!"

I would definitely buy the whole cake if I could! *Durian Ice CreamThis is the real deal! A big sign was put up there stating that it's a ""die die must try"" item. Ugh I mean, how can I just leave without trying it? It comes in two sizes: medium sized pint or small pint. I went with the latter. Wow, my mind was blown away! It was so velvety and rich! You could really taste the durian dancing on your taste bud! A must try indeed! I kept thinking to myself that I should've gotten the bigger pint. Oh well, next time! They also have different durian-inspired offerings such as durian hot pot (yes, for real), durian pancake, durian spring rolls, and many more! If you're looking for gifts to bring home, they sell different durian products (chips, dried durian, kaya jam, candies, cookies, etc.)I would definitely recommend this place to durian lovers out there!

Her cravings for noodles...is as demonic as my cravings for Pampangan Sisig. So I was game. I caved in and followed her even though the last 20+ times I've had any bak chor mee out and about had been a sheer disappointment that made me ask...""where the bloody hell did all the good *shi-fu-level-peeps* go?""She insisted on ordering for me and made me sit like a little bish at the only table available in another overcrowded part of Singapore [surprise...surprise]. She is an older sister to me so I have to listen...I have to obey. But guess what? I skipped being part of a 30+ minute line. These motherfarters are slow at 1930 hrs. Really slow. She was probably 10th in line...but 30 minutes before she got to order and FOR NOODLES??? You've got to be bloody joking!

I did see right after all!Yet, let's put it this way.That farter is alive and still cooking in hungry Singapore because what he brought out...was indeed worth the $4'ish dollars we paid per bowl. He's alive because the liver and minced pork brought loving flavors and a soup so hearty [from hundreds of plunged-to-cook-pork] that it made my heart slow down. He's alive because the freaking noodles seduced my tongue with each nibble and returned my need for bak chor mee in Singapore. He's alive...well...because people forget his snail-act the moment they plow into his food.So they are obviously not close to perfect [and probably brought some shame into the original which I now have to try]...but I'm still a fan because I'd eat this 30-minute-line-bowl-of-bak-chor-mee any freaking given day of my life here in Singapore.

If you are not sure, look for the Apple store or the Muji store, and you will find Shake Shack about 50m away. There used to be horrendous 1-2 hr queues when it first opened. But now, you should be able to get to place your order within 5 to 30 minutes of joining the queue of hungry patrons.SERVICEWith the covid-19 social distancing measures, the only service you experience is when you're queuing to get in and also when you are making your order at the cashier. Other than that, there is no other interaction with the staff. Good and bad perhaps. There is a self service automated hand washing machine around the middle of the restaurant, so that's as close as you get to somone washing your hands for you.FOOD & DRINKSThe special item in Singapore is the Pandan Shake. Just reading the item on the menu gave me a toothache. I might give it a try one day when I need a sugar rush...one day. The Hamburger feels a bit over priced at $7.50 for a basic item. The meat free Shroom Burger ($10.80) is quite good too with a light crispy mushroom patty.Personal favourite items are the crinkle cut fries and Shack Burger ($9.20 single & $14.40 for the double).

While the beef patty itself is average, what really makes this burger standout is the overall quality ingredients including the burger bun, secret sauce, cheese, and bacon. Highly recommend the Smoke Shack which includes the cheese, bacon, and red peppers. Regarding the wait time. If you go during their peak times (weekends all day & weekdays lunch rush) you could wait up to an 1 hour. For  off peak times less than 15 mins."

I did not have too long of a wait since it was mostly just delivery people. The uniquely Singaporean menu item is the pandan shake, which didn't disappoint. It was a sweet treat before a bittersweet goodbye to Singapore"

So I got the smoke shack, milk shakes - peanut butter and the festive shakes, cheesy fries and concretes Shack Attack. The Smoke Shack was with bacon. I was disappointed with the bacon as it was tough not the crispy type. My fellow diners whom had the same felt the same disappointment. You imagine trying to eat some bark, that's what the applewood bacon was like - they must have removed the Apple and left the wood there. Minus 1  . The burger was not put together properly as in you do not get the cherry peppers evenly spread. So in one of my bite I took all the peppers, that was very spicy. Minus 1  for badly put together burger. The holiday cookie shake was like a sugar frozen yogurt. It was totally overly horribly sweet yogurt until the cookie crumbs that was only at the bottom 3 mm of the shake and you get the few cookie crumbs. It would be much better if there were more cookies crumbs. Minus 1 I easily found a table upstairs but as usual the normal locals here don't clean up their mess. There was like 4 staff standing waiting to wipe the tables but do not help clearing the table. They did not even help open the trash box flap when I took all the trash there. Standing like a block of wood.  Sure it is Boxing Day but you choose to come back to work, so get working. However they did wiped off the table. Minus 1 Ok something good must be said here, otherwise I run out of  and I have not even talk about the weird tables/chairs layout. The peanut butter shake was good, not the best or like those in US but for local establishment it is good. Overall the food seems over rated. Or may the hype just too much that I expected perfect food. It is just a so so establishment. I probably go there for the shake again and not the burger."

None of that for Shake Shack. For once, this burger place, on a morning 10.30am crowd, feels a bit like a club, a gathering place, a temple, like an Apple store in the past, of sorts.Yes, this might be a club for burgers and milkshake, much like the Apple store just a few feet away is to a haven for technology.If you wanna have brunch, come in before 10.30am and the queue won't be so bad. We waited for only about 20 mins (queueing and waiting for food altogether) and we were very lucky to have a seat very quickly. We finished our brunch at around 11am.The burger is really like totally opposite of what I used to love - Carl's Junior. None of that messy, cheesy, huge big fat patty. Its packaging may not seem big but it's filling for me (I ordered the single patty). I saw many people actually ordering the double patty. The bun was really high quality, the vegetables fit in just well, not too much and not too little. The patty supposedly tastes higher quality as well. Overall its a premium package burger. Some people might not be impressed as there is no 'kick' or 'wow' factor right off the bat. But when you bite into that clean non-messy-at-all burger and you remembered those days when your jeans had all that spilt sauce from your burger, you might appreciate this experience better. For me, I'd choose this any day. Yes some may say this is expensive. But I like that there is no silly convulated pricing and you do get the quality through in the burger and the milkeshakes, where I suppose shackburger and shakes is where its name derives from.Being impressed I'd give this a 4.5/5.+5 is from their quality, cleanliness, atmosphere, smiley service crew, good shackburger, milkshakes and drinks. You leave feeling good.-0.5 is from overtly-salty fries, not much option on condiments (only ketchup and mustard) and also price could be a bit prohibitive for some."

I came here because some of my friends said it was the in n out of the east coast. Some of my friends told me it was better than in n out. I was honestly pretty disappointed.I ordered the Shroom Burger and fries and I thought it was okay. It didn't taste bad but the taste got boring after awhile. It might be the mushroom but felt that the burger just got tasteless the more I ate it.Shake Shack wasn't bad but it's also not a taste I would crave to come back and eat.
