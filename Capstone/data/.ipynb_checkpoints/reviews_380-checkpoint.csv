Hence the food standard is suspected to be good. Horfun is one of the delicacy here and hence the standard of evaluation is higher without doubt. I hv ordered a medium packet of houfun with excitement and anxiety as rumor was that it taste great here. The verdict unfortunately was not up to my liking.  It lack the ""wok hei"" smell (slight burnt smell but not charred) that I missed for years though the ingredients were plentiful."

The deer meat was okay, but it was drenched in oil. It was tender but you had to dig for the meat under layers of onion.. The ngoh hiang was okay.. Nothing to rave about..The claypot fish was too sweet, I did enjoy the cabbage and pork in there and everyone commented that the fish head was huge.The veggies were also drenched in oil with dried onions sprinkled on top.The lor bak or thick fat pork was so so, the sauce was too sweet.The spicy fried sotong was super sweet which killed my throat. I'm suffering now from this meal.All in all for $125 for each table of 8-9 people it is dirt cheap but the wait was so long, my aunty had to take gastric pills whilst waiting. And the food is just terrible. They are famous for their crabs but they had run out. But I will not give this place another go. It's just terrible.When we asked for two baby chairs, a grumpy aunty gave me a stern look and said, go find yourself..  Really? Is it that hard? We had two babies at the table!"

We ordered 3 crabs, 1 veg, 1 fish & 1 prawn paste chicken. They came back saying prawn paste chicken sold out. As we dig into the first black pepper crab, noticed that the meat shrunken. You see very big claw but when you break the shell the meat is only half the size. Moving on to the 2nd chilli crab, same thing, 3rd butter crab even smaller. Steam fish taste great! All in $306, they gave us $6 discount for the crabs issue. :(We walk all the way to the front to ask them to help pack the left over crabs, they told us to bring all the plates back ourselves in order for them to pack for us.  They did help to pack our food only when we ask them to come collect the payment.Their cooking is quite good but my crab feast is a total flop."

When you come in, you feel like you are almost transported to the 1980s or a Hong Kong cafe movie set. The coin operated orange telephone reminds you of that. The squeaky bench that hadn't been replaced in decades had some flying insect lurking around. Because I was transported back in time, it seems like that can be forgiven. The food came... rice was flavourful, not too oily and just not as mushy as I expected. It was good. The chicken is not as tender as what you'd have at Tian Tian of course. But it is still very smooth. A little gelatinous chicken fat falls into the sauce. We ordered a $10 portion for two persons instead of the $8 and they were honest. Portions ain't too small. (They were flexible to accommodate whatever price for your chicken portion). The soups were also good recommendations. At $3 its almost too good to be true with two persons sharing. All the soups here are generally good. But I do have doubts why they add raw cabbages into it. As if to say this is old school and we do not care why. Then the surprising stunner. Bittergourd with eggs stir fried. It was awesome. We gobbled it all up. It was cooked so well we can't explain it. You still tastes the slight bitterness of the bittergourd but the eggs and sauce neutralises it to the degree that you do not mind. When comes the time for the bill, an old lady with a wide smile came over to us to bid us goodbye as if to say she will be here stuck in time till our next visit, in that time capsule restaurant, while we move on to the future. 5 stars for the nostalgia and the food that pairs with it."

The owners and the no-frills interior of the restaurant harken back to the mom & pop street shop days. The chicken rice was also no-frills, just simply and quietly providing that fuzzy comforting feeling. Nothing more and nothing less was needed.Many tables seemed to be ordering the chestnut drink, so I figured why not. It was a refreshing complement to the lunch meal and helped to cool down from the blistering heat outside.The loofah vegetable dish was also very tasty (and as good as it looks in the Yelp photo), so definitely try that if you can!"

I visited Nam Kee Chicken Rice as part of a birthday celebration of a family member. While the furnishings were old (round wooden tables and plastic chairs), the restaurant was air-conditioned. We were tended to by an elderly lady who spoke mandarin and dialect. Aside from the usual chicken rice, they served a variety of Chinese dishes, or ""zi char"" as Singaporeans term it. All the dishes have a home cooked feel and flavor. We ordered omelette with onion, ngoh hiang, half a chicken, sambal kang kong, stir fried broccoli. The chicken rice was not too oily and light tasting as well, which contributes to the making of good chicken rice.The total bill came up to be 60. Quick math revealed that it was roughly 8 to 9 dollars per pax for an especially filling meal (each had several extra bowls of rice). A word of advise is to not park at road beside the restaurant as it is usually filled up and narrow, not to mention that it is parallel parking. It would be better to park further ahead at the HDB nearby or even at Thomson Plaza before walking over"

The first time I had it, I was not impressed but I returned a second time as my dad wanted to give it a try. They serve a variety of dishes besides the usual chicken and rice and we got a plate of fried kangkong in addition to the chicken rice. The crowd at Nam Kee Chicken Rice is rather misleading. One would think they do really great chicken rice judging from the number of people waiting for a table. Unfortunately, the chicken rice was not satisfactory the 2 times I've eaten there. While the chicken is nice and tender, the portion was really small for 2 people. The rice was what totally changed my impression of the stall. It was mushy and broken and the flavour was bland.I find Nam Kee Chicken Rice pretty over-rated. There are many better and possibly cheaper stalls out there."

Try anything on the list- I'm pretty sure that it will be great. They also supply beans to several others places so you can even buy some of the beans back home. The food/dessert offerings are alright. However, with Awfully Chocolate, Ice Cream Chef, and the hawker centre a stone throw away, I would prefer to just order coffee here. Since It's not easy to come here, the place doesn't get too crowded on most days. They don't offer free wifi or charging point (that I know of), so come with a fully charged laptop. Alternatively, just sit back, sip on the great coffee and read a book."

It had a nice and strong aroma yet the amount of acidity in that cup was not very high thus not leaving a sour aftertaste which i hate. The milk that they added was really nice too and made the coffee all the more yummy to drink, and it left a nice aroma in my mouth after.Service there was average but i would definitely go back for more coffee.

The meat was alright if a bit dry  - it could be a bit more tender and moister. It also could've come with a bit more sauce.Earlier I described this place as Germanish rather than German.

It used to be when you want a drink of the alcoholic type in the area, the options are limited. The pick would be from the coffee shops, karaoke bars or dingy neighborhood pubs which can be quite intimidating. Fast forward to the present, the shops have changed and there are more casual chic and chill out places for drinks and Plonk is definitely new. It is along MyVillage facing the small open air parking lot. It is an open concept with tables and chairs on the sidewalk as well as inside, with no windows or walls to keep people out. It creates an airy and spacious place with a cozier set up on the 2nd level. We took the high table with high chairs as most tables were taken on Friday. I usually dislike high chairs but this place was quite comfortable. The jug of mojito went down well with lots of mint leaves. It can be slightly stronger but for someone who does not drink much, it is good. Refreshing on a warm night. The pizza was the wood fire thin crispy crust type (similar to Skinny Pizza but slightly thicker) and equally good. We chose the one with iberico ham.  It serves regular food, bar bites, tapas and a decent selection of wines, cocktails and beers. I think I may have found a new place for chilling out in my area."

Don't let its multiple locations make it appear like a ""chain"" and touristy, it is serving up some pretty damn good bites and worth a visit.While I'm no expert on another countries national dish, it was pretty good in my book and I'd go back for more. The chicken was beautifully cooked and the meat moist through it all and its simple flavors were quickly brought out by the fragrant rice filled with ginger and spice from garlic. Add the soy or chili flavored sauces on the side to your liking and your set.The roast meats that you can order weren't too shabby and the sautéed vegetables were pretty delicious (but not worth a 14 hour flight for). Service is quick and efficient, while the line does add a bit of a wait time, it moves at a decent pace. Prices are pretty reasonable so you could enjoy a few dishes to share. The ambiance is simple and loud, so probably not the best for that high-level dinner meeting or that romantic special evening. In a city filled with so many options, would I go back?

If you have ever come across the CNN Go World's 50 most delicious food, you'll see this traditional dish stands confidently at number 45. Thus, there's no reason to skip it while we were in Singapore. Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice restaurant was our pick. The place is located on Thomson Road in the Novena area.

We ordered half a steamed chicken and extra sauce. Yum. Cereal prawns was also something we ordered that I've never tried before and I found it to be the balance of crunchy sweet and then savory. They made it pretty well. We also got some local veggies and a hot plate dish of veggies, shrimp, and tofu. Roast chicken was yummy too.

And you know what, very few, if any, do it better than Wee Nam Kee.  Wee Nam's Chicken Rice comes in two distinct forms: Steamed or Roasted. Wee Nam's speciality is undoubtedly the ""Roasted"" Chicken Rice. I prefer dark meat, so I usually order the Drumstick Rice. Regardless of your order, whether the regular chicken rice or drumstick rice, you are in for a treat.The roasted chicken rice delivers a crunchy skin, but yet is soo juicy on the inside. The flavours of the chicken just seem to secrete out of the skin. These chicken flavours are so good that I don't even bother to use Chilli sauce or the sweetish dark sauce that normally accompanies Singapore Chicken Rice dishes. The cilantro sprinkled on top is just heavenly.I've tried three Wee Nam Kee locations and the one in United Square is clearly the best. I'm not sure if it's the original, but it's just that much better. Service is suspect, but then again, one doesn't go to Wee Nam for the service, but rather for the food. Fair Warning: any dish outside of chicken rice could take a while to serve.The Bottom Line: Wee Nam delivers a killer Roasted Chicken Rice. If you prefer steamed Chicken Rice, Tian Tian still reigns supreme in my book. The United Square Branch is The Crown Jewel of the Wee Nam Kee franchise!"

Some complain it's a bit pricey for chicken rice, but in my opinion, it's still pretty affordable considering it's air conditioned.I've tried both their (steamed/boiled?) chicken and their roasted chicken. If you've seen me on Talk answering questions about chicken rice and local cuisine, you'll know which one I'd almost marry (*whispers* it's the roasted one!)After a year and a half on the island, I'm surprised at how I'm starting to notice the difference between everyone's recipes. I think Wee Nam Kee has the best chicken, but I stand by Boon Tong Kee's rice as the more flavorful and fragrant contender.I'm a bit wary of recommending this place for someone who's never tried chicken rice, as I'm unsure if they'd appreciate or enjoy it as much. Plus, there are no ang mo celebrity chef endorsements here. :-P This is a great location in Novena; however you can also check out their other outlet in Marina Square if you can't venture too far from CBD."

It's almost as difficult in trying to get a consensus when asking Chicagoans where to find the best deep dish pizza in the city. Everyone has their favorite chicken rice. Wee Nam Kee is one the popular choices for chicken rice in Singapore.We order half a chicken and the meat is tender. The skin over the pieces of chicken is smooth but without the gelatinous layer under the skin like at Tian Tian. At Wee Nam Kee, the chicken sits on a layer of sweet-savory soy sauce that is very tasty (at Tian Tian, a golden glaze is used instead).When it comes to choosing a personal favorite establishment for chicken rice, it is more than the chicken itself that come into consideration. The accompanying rice, chilli sauce, and ginger sauce are as important and they complete the chicken rice experience. The gold standard of rice that is part of the chicken rice experience should be fragrant (traditionally, uncooked rice is fried with chicken fat before the rice is placed in the rice cooker). At Wee Nam Kee, the rice is almost reminiscent of brown rice and there is a lack of fragrance, though the chilli and ginger sauce are a little better than just good. Overall, the chicken, chilli sauce, and ginger sauce are pretty good but the rice does not stand out here. If you want to have more than chicken rice, the kitchen here prepares other itmes such as deep fried stuffed tofu and stir-fried venison with ginger and scallions."

So good that we ended up ordering another drumstick.Rice is fluffy and flavorful.

The noodles are to the right amount of doneness such that even toward the end of the bowl, it's not soggy but still slightly springy.  Although I always order the soup version, I've heard people rave about the dry version too.There can be quite a long wait on weekends, but if so, what my mom and I would do is to place an order for take away, do some marketing, and come back just in time to pick up the order.

Onion rings with curry mayo; otak; mushroom soup and homemade foccacia. The bread was utterly disappointing, a thin slice for sharing when we thought it came with the soup. Onion rings were a winner! Burger came fast and it took us only a few minutes to stuff our bellies. The char siew was a little too sweet for our liking. Friend describe it as eating a chocolate cake but in a meat form. Nevertheless, if you like char siew & bbq sauce, go for it. Ramlee burger was decent. With that I can only say that I'm a snob, because we are used to messy processed patty with all the silly sauces and kraft blue tub. Still, I really enjoyed the dish. Love the thai radish/cucumber salad. It was really refreshing and flavourful. Dessert was, well, bad. Sorry but I can't stand a dry cake, even after you slap it with a scoop of ice cream. Service was brilliant. Two guys running the front on a weekday, brilliant job! It's a great spot to chill out with friends and family but casual dining."

I can't help feeling that truffle fries, the smell of which was wafting from the next table, would've been a nicer touch to the plate.E, on the other hand, was tempted into Spaghetti Arrabiata ($17.50++). In her words, it was ""really good!"" which in any case, was good enough for me knowing that food is genuinely being enjoyed.I was feeling under the weather so I had to tear myself away from the meat and battered food. I picked the Butterfish in Cilantro Pesto Sauce ($26.00++). I had ordered the most lackluster (and not to mention, the most expensive) dish at the table for the night. To give credits, the fish was nicely grilled but it was rather tough - I couldn't decide if butterfish were meant to be so and it was just my Asian tastebuds being used to smooth silky fish meat. Nevertheless, the dish did not quite make its worth.A great place to head down to wind down with close friends and family. I'll say stick to the burgers."

Also when I'd asked about all day breakfast, the waiter rather condescendingly said, ""But you're too late. Until 4 only."" Really, I was very unimpressed by his attitude and felt rather offended. I can think of at least 10 different ways be could have said that nicely, with a smile.I ordered the burger with blue cheese and poached pear and it was stunning.

Instead of the usual condiment stacking in a regular burger, all toppings including the beef patty are wrapped in a thin layered omelet, hence creating a packet of intense flavors. If you're in the mood for a western adventure, go on and give the Poached Pear and Blue Cheese Burger a shot. If you need more toppings to satisfy your taste buds, add-ons are available for small fee. Wild Rocket also serves the occasional Asian inspired pasta which might prove a little spicy for some so be sure to check with your server.

I do not really know since when my family and I love coming to this place but we have definitely come here for awhile now.What to order from here? Mee Rebus and popiah are my two favorite dishes here. I enjoy eating the Mee Rebus sauce as it has a tangy feeling after you eat it. The portion wise is not big but for it's price (less than $5), it was worth it. I think I prefer the Mee Rebus here than to other ""toast"" chains. For the popiah, you might need to wait awhile before being serve. The wait gets crazy over the weekend as a lot of people seemed to only like their popiah instead of their local delicacies. For the popiah, like many newspaper articles had mentioned, it is one of the best. The ingredients made the whole popiah to be fragrant and not soggy. Depending on your tastebuds, a hint of chili sauce might increase the tastiness of the popiah itself. The price was also reasonable.If you would like to avoid the crowds, do not come during peak hours (lunch time) or weekends. The seating for this place was limited and you might need to share tables with other customers if you come alone.Another suggestion is that instead of take aways, consume it fresh (as in dining in). It definitely has different taste if you consume it straightaway or ten to fifteen minutes later. Will definitely continue to support this place.

My favourite part of their popiah is its texture: a few other ingredients added to the mix also gives it a very nice crisp in every bite, yet the skin is soft so the filling is always fighting to break free.I haven't had anything else memorable here.

Its been around for as long as I can remember- and serves one of the best popiahs I have ever had. The radish in their popiahs are cooked to perfection- soft, tasty and appetizing. They also throw in a bunch of magic ingredients that I cant really tell- but there is something in their popiah that gives it an extra crunch (could be lard- so sinful but I don't care). One sells for $2.20 which is pretty expensive, but looking at the queue I don't think price is a factor when the fanatics are queuing for this popiah. Sometimes the popiah is made by the aunty, sometimes the uncle, it doesn't really matter because they are equally good.Their other dishes are also not too bad, but pretty expensive. I remember their Japanese food selling for as much as sushi tei's, but I really didn't like my tempura udon. The tempura was fried chinese-style- weird, heavy batter and the udon was overcooked. I also sometimes have the meesiam which I quite enjoy- tangy and spicy at the same time. The store is also very 'spiritual', and plays church music like hillsongs. I don't really have an opinion on it because it doesn't really bother me. What bothers me more is that sometimes the aunty gets really grumpy when she's busy though in a harmless way."

The cheese was ultra cheesy, with every bite you could pull the cheese out and twirl it in circles with your mouth. So chewy and addictive. The egg reminded me of the egg sandwiches my mother sometimes made for me, and bacon being bacon, can't go wrong as long as it's not chaota.My cousin ordered the seafood soup. It was served in a cup, cute. The taste was very savoury; I felt it tasted a lot like prawn soup while she felt it tasted full of clam flavour.

Thanks to Saybons, I can enjoy all three of these French classics at affordable prices and within arm's reach! Although compact in size, the eatery's jovial ambience makes it ideal for both business lunches and intimate meetings with friends. (Takeaway is available too) A hot favourite here is the Crepe, which comes in either savoury or sweet concoctions. Choose from heavy-duty ingredients like Salmon, Onions and Cheese to light fixtures such as Tuna and Capsicum. I'm not an outright sweet tooth but when cravings are concerned, anything to do with Nutella hits the target.  The ""Nutty Nutella"" crepe features our beloved Nutella spread sprinkled with roasted hazelnut bits for extra oomph. Don't expect too much filling in your crepe though!Don't forget to pick up the tantalising Soups, which are presented in mugs because sipping is the way to go. Personally, ""Brocolli and Cheddar"" as well as ""Potato and Leek"" remain my favourite soup flavours so far. The soups' thick, creamy texture brings comfort to my palette! For someone health conscious like me, I was pleased to find that besides these vitamin-packed soups, the eatery also serves up crunchy mini salads."

My personal favourite is the Nutella crepe because hey, anything with Nutella is instantly good. Though I wish the crepes itself was a little thicker and that they'd be more generous with their fillings. The consistency is also a bit off cuz sometimes you get a really nicely done one and sometimes it's kinda crappy so it really depends on the person making your crepes. They've got escargot now too but I don't think I'll be trying that anytime soon. The place is more like a cafe than a restaurant really and they've got coffee and tea on the menu too. When I first started coming here they didn't have seats but now they've got a whole seating area that you can chill out at. Just manage your expectations when you eat here.

You can even read more about each of them if you sit at one of the tables on the side. Salads are good and always fresh. I do wish they could be served in dishes for eating in, rather than taking up so much plastic. :( but they are yummy and flavorful. The chickpea avocado one is healthy and filling! Escargot! Definitely yum, if you like snails (which I do). I haven't tried all the flavours, but I tend to think simple is best, and they do it pretty well here -- so unusual for a casual franchise joint like this.So why not 4 stars? The decor is just... ugh. I really don't want to stay / sit there, even though the staff are generally friendly. The colours are too bright and seem completely in contrast to the calm, comforting food they serve here. Also, they rely far too much on disposable serving containers and such. If you are a cafe, and you have a SINK, you should serve things in dishes. I dislike contributing to the throw-away culture, especially given the wee island we are all living on. But hey, the food is good, and so I'm saying Saybons deserves 3-star decency."

Tried my hubby's Aglio Olio with truffle and salad, it was a tad bland to the taste, but the spaghetti was cooked just right, firm and not whimpy.Mum commented her Rosemary spring chicken was also bland, and Dad's mixed grill was great, loved the sunny side up on it.Service is not really there as they basically just takes order amd serves food. We had to keep asking for the menu, a 3 person crew includes 2 chefs and 1 waiting staff. Apparently chefs do not hand out menu even though 1 was not cooking (yet), and just kept telling us to order at the cashier (it's a small place with 5 tables for crying out loud). Bottom line: good food, don't expect service, they are not rude, just non-chalant."

We occupied the seats toward the back of the restaurant for larger groups. The waiter serving us provided us with menus with were detailed and descriptive with photos of the various types of dishes that were available. There are slips of paper where you write your order down. You then have to go to the counter to submit your order and pay. This was slightly surprising but I guess in terms of hiring employees it is more cost efficient? I ordered the chicken katsu curry and our meals arrived about 15 to 20 minutes after we ordered which was quite prompt. The meal came with a small plate of sliced watermelon and a bowl of salad. There is also a sesame salad dressing which you can dash on your salad for more flavour.Overall the chicken katsu was crispy and quite tasty. The curry was served in good portions as well and went really well with the rice. My colleagues also commented that the food served was of a high standard and in terms of price it is affordable and worth paying for. I would definitely visit Hajime again if given the opportunity.

Ordered a hot green tea at $1.50, disappointed that it comes with the tea bag. The whole idea is you have to go to the counter for refill yourself. What?!Yes, because there is no gst/sc! I like this idea if im not having any burden with me. (the kid or gold bars)To order your food, write your choice down on the ordering slips found on table & make your payment at the counter. Took about 10 mins for food to arrive. They will serve it to you though for this part. We ordered side orders too but they were ordinary frozen food (gyoza, tofu, chicken) My main course is pretty good as the pork was tender & nicely fried. It is not oily and doesnt leave me feeling bloated. Some of us ordered the ramen & all commented that it was too salty & would not order again. Lucky day for me to order the right food.

Sakurazaka is the new restaurant of Consultant Chef Masashi Horiuchi (also of Shelter in the Woods and Verre Wine Bistro), and it marries Masashi's Japanese heritage and European culinary roots in this Shabu Shabu and Sukiyaki restaurant. Tuck into one of the 3 Shabu Shabu sets available at Sakurazaka- Pork ($48), Seafood ($54), or Beef ($64). Each set comes with the stone grilled Ishiyaki (Iberico, Seafood, or Wagyu), meats, vegetables, and a dessert (traditional Kakigori) to end off! It's always fun to be able to participate in your meal. Dip the sizzling grilled meats into the onsen tamago with mild Sukiyaki sauce. Have your choice of Shabu Shabu in 6 different broths specially created by Chef Masahi. Expect an infusion of European flair in the special soup stock with the rich and tangy Bouillabaisse stock and light Beef Consommé; or have a taste of Kyushu with the Ago Dashi (dried flying fish stock). Of course, the regular Chicken, Tonkotsu, and even Soya Milk are available. My favorites are the versatile Ago Dashi, and the slightly milky Tonkotsu.To accompany the prime meats and seafood, 3 special dipping sauces are provided. My favorite is the refreshing and light peppery and very versatile Tamari Ponzu made with miso essence and yuzu. The Shiyo Ponzu is a slightly tart sudachi with seaweed salt. Of course, there's also the rich Goma sauce, with a touch of espelette pepper in this one.  Have the Seafood set with the Bouillabaisse stock for that superb umami flavor at the end. Tiger prawns, white clams, succulent scallop, red snapper, squid, and mussels are in this one. The fresh prawn paste was definitely my favorite of the lot. The minced prawn is mixed with lotus roots, shiitake mushrooms, and shiso.The Pork set is very enticing with the Kagoshima Shirobuta Pork (loin and belly). This meat is whiter, tender, and slightly sweet; and the fats are translucent with a light chew. Superb! Beef lovers would go gaga over the Japanese Aomori rice-fed beef (striploin and rib-eye)! The cows are fed with whole rice crop and spring water from Mount Hakkoda for that umami flavor. Lucky them and lucky us! We enjoyed the meaty texture of the striploin and the ribeye had a good fat to meat ratio as well. I actually prefer the Aomori to the Joshu Wagyu. I'm not saying that the F1 Joshu Wagyu Beef from Gunma isn't a good option (a la carte option). Just look at that marbling! The fats melted easily with a few swishes in the soup (have the Tonkotsu for that added beef-pork savory flavor), and the huge skirt of beef would break apart if you are not quick enough. The amount of tender fats was just a little of an overkill for me. The overall mouth feel was a tad fluffy and pillowy. It's just a personal (non) preference #firstworldproblem.You could also order the generous slices of foie gras for an added indulgence. I still prefer my foie gras seared.At the end of meal, you can choose to have rice poured into the leftover broth in the pot for Sakurazaka's version of a risotto. Cheese and egg are added to the mix as well and you could then top it up with the side condiments of chili miso, garlic and chili oil, spring onions and sesame. Our version made with the Bouillabaisse stock created an explosion in our mouths. It tasted like a creamy Hae Bee Biam Chili Chwee Kueh almost! I'm never going anywhere else for Sukiyaki after being spoilt by Chef Masashi. The F1 Wagyu-Holstein cross-breed beef in the Sukiyaki set has a very good marbling and is considered the best Wagyu cross-breed. The meat and vegetables are first cooked in a pan, followed by the addition of broth and condiments such as soy sauce, sugar and mirin. Chef Masashi had refined the sukiyaki sauce and made it less sweet to suit the local palate and we thought he nailed the balance. The recommended sauces are the ponzu, and sesame sauce. And obviously there's a raw egg in the mix too.Rounding off the meal is the Kakigori, made of finely shaved ice, flavored with syrup and condensed milk - similar to patbingsu, haluhalo, and ice kachang. Ujikintoki Green Tea is obviously a crowd pleaser and there's an intense green tea ice cream hidden inside. Another refreshing one that we enjoyed is the Port Wine Kakigori with port wine jelly and blood orange. I'm definitely a fan of Sakurazaka. I think this is almost the only reason for me to make the trek down to Bukit Timah. Individual sets are available now so you can satisfy your craving even if no one else wants to (are you kidding me)!"

Our last visit was many years back and then it had left us a good impression of enjoying French Cuisine without splurging too much. This little hidden Gem is conveniently located at Botanic Garden MRT and takes about less than 5 minutes to walk if you know the direction to Serene Centre.The environment was simple and down to earth, a kind of cosy place that I will want to have for a meal.Mushroom Soup & Prawn Bisque with additional Bread Basket - $6, $8.50 & $4Four Piece Bread Rolls with 2 Pieces Butter - $4The two-course weekend set at $35 is available for Lunch and Dinner, from Friday to Sunday. The Entree comes with 2 choices, Ravioli of Prawns and Foie Gras in light Lemon Creme Sauce or Escargots Bourgogne (6 pieces) served with Salad mix with French dressing. 2 Course Weekend Set @ $35I wasn't quite game for Escargots for that evening, thus I chose Ravioli instead. On an ala carte order, the dish alone will cost $19.50. The dish comes with 3 big Ravioli, stuffed with prawns and Foie Gras, cooked in light lemon creme sauce drizzled with a handful of chopped parsley.Ravioli of Prawns and Foie Gras in light Lemon Creme SauceThis Entree is surprisingly good and appetizing in the sweet light cream sauce. The entire piece of prawn and Foie Gras can be obviously seen in the pocket of the Ravioli, great!While the Mains you can choose to have Confit De Canard (French Duck Leg) with Gratin Potatoes, Yellowfin Tuna Steak Loin with Sweet Paprika & Olive Oil served with Petit French Beans and Buttered Rice or Air flown Sirloin Steak served with Salad & Gratin PotatoesThe plate looked quite empty as they served the bubbling hot gratin potatoes in a separate dish. The portion was small, no complains as the business name already told us that its ""Petite"". Striploin steak weighs an average of 125 to 130g and is served with mesclun salad and potatoes gratin. My steak was done medium-well as requested and sat in the middle of brown sauce accompanied by the greens and mustard sauce. Although the portion is small, I was kind of full halfway through this meal. I'm happy and satisfied with the beef taste and the meat was not too gamey. On a separate note, an ala carte dish cost about $19.50Be careful not to touch the side of the Potato Gratin dish as they are scalding hot. The edges are slightly charred with potatoes slices overlapping each other with compliments of sour cream.While the guy has a bigger appetite, he has twice the amount of Beef from Airflown Australian Beef Tenderloin which weighs about 250g. Airflown Australian Beef Tenderloin 250g - $34.50Medium doneness was served perfectly on the serving board accompanied by mesclun greens as well as sweet mustard tasting sauce and of course not forgetting the potatoes gratin that was separated out too.Black Forest Cake tasted somehow similar to the one cake we bought off the shelves. The cake was spongy and come with chocolate shavings and a dollop of fresh cream both on top of the cake as well as by the side of the cake. The significant part of black forest cake comes with hints of wine taste and this has it.Black Forest Cake - $8The standard of food is still pretty good as compared to the last visit.

So I went not expecting much. The place was really tiny! It was not a proper restaurant with a shop shell. Instead the kitchen/cashier counter seemed to take up the entire proper shop space, so the tables were actually outside that space. Quite a strange layout as it looked like people could just enter and walk through to get inside Serene Centre.With just 5-6 small tables inside, they really cannot accommodate big groups or take reservations. I think once people realize that, they will not and should not expect the restaurant to accede to their requests.Maybe we were lucky but the service was good when we were there. At 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, only a few tables were occupied, so we were able to get a table immediately. We were greeted in French by the French chef-owner who was sitting by the door. He was a bit quirky caustic with a bit of mischievous fun, very French, when interacting with the diners. Definitely not those amiable and super friendly chefs in other family style restaurants. We were given the menu, and complimentary warm crusty rolls with butter were served shortly after we placed our order at the cashier. The bread was fabulous, very fresh and set the tone for the hearty meal. Water was available near the cashier, self serve. Specials of the day were posted on the board at the cashier. I had the beef bourguignon which was the best I ever tasted in Singapore. It did not have the burnt bovril taste. The stew had a natural beefiness and smooth finish, with melt in your mouth meat. I did not need to use the knife at all. It came with a bowl of al dente spaghetti which was generously coated with butter (I think) so it was quite tasty on its own. The duck confit was divine. The skin was super crispy and the meat was tender juicy. It came with creamy potatoes which were just so good. I would go back again, just to try the other dishes. It is only opened for lunch and dinner."

We had onion and carrot with orange soups. Great except the saltiness :). The Magret de Canard (duck breast) in honey thyme sauce tasted very very good despite the breast a bit too over-cooked in certain portions.

The cream is tastefully prepared, the specialty mushrooms burst with sautéed goodness, the meat is always tender and slightly undercooked (sometimes) to preserve the flavour (because that's how they do it!).Prices are on the fun side (just above $10 for a main), the checkered tablecloths are cute and the crockery is pretty basic, in order to keep prices down for our enjoyment, and I feel bad for not coming here often enough.

I was thus fairly upset on my latest visit when I found out that they had taken it off their menu.What better to commiserate this loss than with a wonderful plate of foie gras with a sort of orange compote, served with such a generous side of salad. The foie gras was wonderfully pan-fried so it melts in your mouth - so smooth on the inside, while maintaining a thin and crisp membrane to hold the goodness in. The sweet orange compote was the perfect complement - not overwhelmingly sweet, and tangy enough to be unexpectedly tasty. I then had a duck confit canard as my main, because this dish has rarely failed me. It was slightly disappointing this time because the meat didn't peel off as tenderly as I'd expected it too, though the skin was still well crispy. The duck is served with a crispy and creamy potato gratin - so very satisfying I always wipe my plate clean. I've also had the escargot in a croissant before, which was quite an unusual experience as I had always pictured escargots to be in little pots soaked with garlic and oil, so this was quite different, having almost no scent of either. This was therefore rather refreshing, and I really enjoyed it, though maybe the escargot was a little overcooked when I had it."

I've visited both outlets before, but we're going to talk about the outlet at Serene Centre today.The Spaghetti Carbonara, or ""Spaghetti with ham in crème sauce"" which costs $15 is worth most of its bites. I'll explain why the term ""most"" later. It tastes good. No doubt about that. Whether it's worth every bite? Now that's debatable. I remember the first time I tried this dish, my eyes lit, my brain became active and there was this general sense of ""feeling better"" the moment I ate it. The flavours were balanced, the dish looks simple stunning and I loved the cream sauce! There was perhaps a very polite way of presenting this dish by letting the herbs run free along the plate.

Amazingly good. Our group shared a bunch of sides including fries, broccolini, and mushrooms. Everything was polished off with tiramisu - also amazing."

All you can eat Korean BBQ for $15++ weekday lunch but there's a current promo for 4 diners where you just pay for 3. Optional cash top up to have hotpot on the side too. Decent selection of mostly frozen meats. Didn't really care for the pork belly and other frozen cuts of meat but appreciated the marinade in the bulgogi beef that make it more tender and flavorful. The jap chae and kim chee were pretty decent too and served to be good condiments for the meats. Wrap them together in some lettuce and we have a decent lettuce wraps for lunch. A variety of other veggies, soups, and pre-cooked dishes complete the buffet line-up. The buffet gets you a variety of sodas and really piping hot tea. Service is negligible and we were seated in a really cramped section but I appreciated that the restaurant was well-ventilated."
