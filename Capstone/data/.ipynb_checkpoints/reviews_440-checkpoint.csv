It's simple ingredients and yet not all places make it well. This local popiah and kueh pie ti is very yummy and satisfying and it's just S$1.50 for popiah and 5 for S$3.00  for pie ti. The owner or person who I frequently see working is approachable and nice. He is quick with filling orders and you can tell he works hard. The popiah skin is fresh and he knows how to make the popiah with proper amounts of filling (jicama, carrots, etc), crispy bits, sauces, veggies, and crushed peanuts. I also prefer the sambal chili vs without but both tend to do the job. Oh also, he wraps it well so once it is cut, it doesn't fall part as quickly as other places that I've been to too. Apparently fortune food started off as a single successful hawker stand and now has branched off to multiple outlets. They also do party set orders which is neat too. Many locals also order the muah chee (glutenous rice balls coated with crushed peanut and sugar), which I feel is similar to Japanese mochi just with a different coating and spin on it. But generally it is quite tasty and not too sweet. Id recommend this place if you're in the area and to get the popiah and for the price you can't beat it. Check it out. Tip/ cash only Tip2/ try one with chili and one without and see what you prefer Tip3/ the hawker is in the food center that is just behind the Kovan MRT station so it's pretty convenient if you're making your way out this way"

My friend have been praising it for its palatable curry. To be frank, I was not too surprised by the taste of the green curry that I ordered. The flavor is indeed good but it is nothing special from good curry in other restaurants. The rice is also plain. However, what is impressive of the restaurant is that the price is proportional to the performance of the dishes, unlike some restaurants where the prices are inflated. In the green curry, there is a rather large portion of chicken(the customer can choose one from chicken, prawn, pork and beef to put into the curry)and dotted with some brinjals. I was amazed by the amount of chicken that I found in the curry. I did not expect so much meat in a dish priced $10.80. The great price performance ratio of the restaurant is worth a four-star overall rating."

Absolutely no complaints about it. The menu has a small or medium sized portion available ($12/20), and we both opted for the small which was actually a good sized portion. We were both very pleased. Then the bill arrived...we were charged $4+ for the mango salad, and $0.80 for wet naps--one of which we did not use. I refrained from arguing with the staff since we had gobbled up the mango salad without asking, and it's not worth arguing over 80 cents. Instead, I will think twice before returning.

Every weekend, Two Chefs Eating Place is bounded to be packed with a long line of customers queuing up. Their signature dish, the Butter Ribs 牛油排骨 has been highly raved about on the internet. I have been itching to try Two Chefs Eating Place for more than two years. The travelling journey was the main reason why I had been procrastinating for so long. I was thrilled when I got to know that Two Chefs Eating Place had opened a second outlet at Sin Ming (that's near Upper Thompson / Bishan). In fact, it's just located next to Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery which is the largest Mahayana Temple in Singapore. It would be timely to visit and try out their dishes.I believed that Two Chefs Eating Place either bought over or rented the entire coffee shop. The staff at the drink, roti prata and vegetarian stalls were all wearing Two Chef's uniform. The coffee shop was just half full during lunch time on a weekend. In fact, when we arrived at 1215pm, the place was literally empty except for another group of customers. There were many ceiling and wall fans that helped ventilate the place.Two Chefs Eating Place's menu with over 79 dishes. If you are visiting for the first time, you might want to ask the staff to recommend their signature dishes. We ordered several of their signature items and did not have to wait long before the first dish was served to us.The Drunken Cockles  醉蚶 which has garnered lots of rave reviews online was the first dish to be served. The plate of half-shelled cockles was served cold. They were covered with light soya sauce covered with lots of garlic, spring onion and chilli padi. The cockles were fresh with no sand in it and had just a slight raw taste. I thought that this was just an average appetiser. Nothing great to should about. And of course, your mouth will stink after eating this dish (due to the raw garlic). =PThe Vegetable with Egg, Salted Egg and Century Egg 三蛋时菜 was another dish that Netizen raved about. It was another disappointment; badly executed. The spinach which was supposed to be soft was firm and hard. The gavy which should have been so tasty due to the 3 eggs and spinach was tasteless. The chef failed to extract the flavours of the ingredients into the gravy. I had better ones elsewhere.The Hot Plate Beancurd arrived sizzling hot. Executed slightly different from most other Cze Char stalls, instead of slices of round shaped beancurd, the beancurds (tofu) were long, rectangular in shape and were soft. The gooey brown gravy was tasty with lots of minced meat and egg underneath. The gravy complemented the rice well and was not overly salty. An average dish. Full review at FoodieFC's blog"

After reading through the reviews, I thought we should give it a shot. We ordered the ""must try"" cockles which turned out rather ordinary, and may have been responsible for my sis-in-law's diarrhea later as well. We ordered two crabs at $35 each, and one turned out to be so crappy that it's possibly the worst chili crab we ever had! They did replaced the bad crab though. The coffee ribs or something was not too bad, but they spoilt it by spooning powdered milk onto it! The egg-yolk shrimp is the only dish that's nice. Bottom line, it's our last time there. Totally disappointed and embarrassed as I brought my mother and my mother-in-law for dinner!"

Rice bowls are decent and I've gone back for them but I'd give the mee sua with oysters a miss. The strong fishy taste could not be covered by the vinegar which laced the bowl. The chicken cutlet was pretty good as was the bubble tea. Price wise, I'd say it's a bit pricey for the value of the food and tastiness of it."

I've official tried 75% of their menu! Majority of the items here are fried, so do note that. Most of their dishes are great for sharing for 2-3 pax.1. Salted Crispy Chicken $6.80One would expect them to sell the XL crispy chicken cutlet,  but they have this instead. Served hot and crispy, it's a great snack to share. It is slightly salty but just right for me.2. Five Spice Cheese Fries $4.80I love these cheese fries and I have to eat a lousy plate of cheese fries. The cheese itself is melted onto the fries and never hardens. The fries aren't crisp, they're more of the soggy kind and taste slightly peppery.3. Cheese Mantou $4.80The mantous were deep fried to crispiness and it had a generic cheese slice placed on top of it to melt. To be honest, I had higher expectations of this, the mantous were okay, and the cheese seriously just tasted like any kraft cheese.4. Eggroll with Pork Floss $6.80One of my more favourite snack dishes from here, I love pork floss and with the egg rolls, it adds some substance to the dish. It can get quite filling eating too much of this, but for $6.80 you get two rolls. Not alot, but enough for everyone to get a piece or two.5. Fried Prawn Omelette $7.80Quite oily but I'm used to their style of food here. Quite a number of prawns, cooked with veggies and beansprouts. Tasted decent.6. Scallion Pancake $4.80I love cong yu bing! Although my favourite is from Dong Bei Ren Jia in Chinatown, this isn't too bad either. It is like a crispy roti prata with a chewy inside.7. Brinjal with Pork Floss $4.80I rarely like to eat brinjal but this was a completely different experience. The brinjal was soft inside, almost like mushy pumpkin and on the outside, and a crispy batter on the outside.8. Fried Shitake Mushroom $8.80I liked their mushrooms. It was juicy on the inside and it had a very crispy batter on the outside. 9. Green Lime & Sour Plum $3.80Most of their hot drinks here, just make me suspect that they're instant powdered drinks. So I decided to go with a cold drink, this wasn't too bad. It tasted okay, and it was a hot day, so a cooling drink was the best option for me.10. Mango Snow Ice $6.80This is my favourite flavour of mango snow ice and they were quite generous with the mango, although this slightly more than what other shops charge for mango snow ice. The snow ice melted so quickly, it was rather upsetting. The shop though air conditioned, isn't that cool, they also use oscillating fans mounted on the walls to keep the shop cool.I made a reservation for 730pm on a friday and unlike the last time I visited, it has become a lot quieter. Not sure why, parking was simple ans straightforward as there's maybe 20 or so parallel parking HDB lots. Gotta bring your coupons."

It as okay. Self service menu and your go up front when you've marked your order and to pay. - Braised beef noodle: served warm which made it less enjoyable as well as inconsistency of the beef. Some pieces were very tough while others were fine. - Egg omelette: okay. I could do without the drizzle of sweet on top. - Scallion pancake: not bad. I'd say it was crispy and good. Could use more scallions. But it wasn't super oily so that is nice. Seems like a decently popular place, but I wouldn't mind trying the places near it too. Tip: No gst or service charge. Also free wifi. But in my opinion that doesn't matter if the food is only okay. Tip: They also accept credit cards"

Being well-acquisition with Taiwanese cuisine, I naturally had to head down to test out the dishes for myself. Between my family, we had quite a bit to share to have a good gauge of whether this place can make the cut of satisfying our cravings for Taiwanese food!We started off with the Cold Noodles - a typical Taiwanese street dish mixed in sesame sauce and sliced cucumbers. The one here was alright, bordering on tasteless but still alright and didn't quite have the right kick from the counterparts on the streets. We then got the salt-and-pepper chicken which is one of our night market favourites. We thought this was more aptly like popcorn chicken. The oyster omelet was decent, recognizing an effort to mimic a large proportion of flour mixture in typical Taiwanese oyster omelet. Not a bad dish but a different sauce from the ones in Taipei was used. At this point, we were thinking perhaps we shouldn't be expecting the dishes to taste like those in Taipei because it just made every dish taste that bit lacking.We rounded up with braised meat rice which tasted more sweet than the ones we had, as you will have with the fillings in dumplings. Maybe we started off wrongly, maybe we got it wrong, I don't know. It was alright, but not as authentic as people claim.In any case, I know they have their fair share of fans, so head down to decide for yourself."

I love their beer too which comes in a few flavours like grape, lychee and mango which are all really delicious to drink.I loved the oyster omelette too as it was exactly like the Taiwan version, eggy with crispy tapioca flour. The braised meat rice was delicious too really fragrant and the sauce blended well with the rice. The meat was also juicy and tender.There were other desserts there too like shaved ice and it felt like i was eating in Taiwan. Definitely a place to go for people who love Taiwan food."

The meat was tender and flavourful. The mash potato on the other hand, tasted instant but still not too bad to add a different taste to the salmon.Truffle Mushroom Pizza $15.80 The truffle smell was yumz, but it dissipated quickly. My dining partners commented that the portion of mushrooms was little though I did appreciate the size of the pizza. Definitely too much for 1, great for sharing amongst 2-3 with beers all around. The crust though thin-crust can make me pretty gerlat, think of khong-guan cream cracker style of crust texture.Bar bites:MAD wings $9.80 I requested for the sauce to be separate from the wings as I had feared the wings would turn soggy after an extended photo taking session. The MAD sauce was tangy and spicy at the same time! The wings came piping hot and were really crispy from top to tip.Battered silverfish with aioli dip Think of fish and chips but in a tinier version! The aioli dip was pretty addictive and I couldn't stop eating this, greasy, but so good!The strawberry milkshake was simply delightful! Perfect for a sunny Sunday 36C afternoon!Overall : The food is pretty good considering the Eatigo discount. I really can't complain for the quantity of food , not to mention the free parking on weekends at Breadtalk IHQ. The pizza is definitely worth mentioning along with the baked salmon! Service was also quick and friendly. I'm coming back to Meat N Malts to try more of their pizza and meat offerings for sure!"

It has a slight spiciness to it. The seafood also doesn't really come through. With two prawns and a couple of squid. The prawns are not even that great. It costs $27.The margherita was a nightmare and I wonder why Leslie Tay would even recommend this place! My microwave pizza box could probably taste even better. The thin crust dough was done rather well but the ""sauce"" on it was very average and just add a few cherry tomatoes on it.

Besides being served in a claypot, they gave a different feel from the mainstream hokkien mee as you can see significance differences in the ingredients.Claypot Hokkien Mee - $10A good few pieces of tasty ""Sio Bak"" (Roasted Pork Belly) had been given and apparently, you get to see ""La La"" in it, which is not common other than the usual prawns, squid, pork belly, pork lards and eggs.Ingredients Lay out for individual portionCrispy dark brown pork belly was delicious! It might be a little salty but it taste good alone with its crackling skin.As a whole in terms of Hokkien Mee, it does have its consistency but still lacking of a good strong stock punch that will actually lift the dish up. Noodles was wet enough, wasn't the dry version that I have read. Personally, I was kind of disappointed about taste but still its a good to know about such dish with tasty pork belly exists."

I think if I have not tried Come Daily (especially when it was still fried by the father), I will rate this as very good. The fun and wow factor is definitely the claypot as the noodle will come bubbling furiously with steam wafting all over it. And you actually get to taste 2 versions of the Hokkien Mee. The wet version when you dish it out with plenty of gravy over it. And then the dry version after the noodle has soaked up all the gravy when you are on your 2nd or 3rd plate. It took me a while to make out what is the difference between this and Come Daily as both are good. This is not as rich or full flavored so you will not get the ""jelak"" feeling after you finished.  It is still flavorful but I just feel something is missing - the jelakness. Hahahaha. For the $10 claypot (more than enough for 2 persons, though the guy tried to persuade us to order the $15), we get 2 prawns, plenty of tiny sotong rings, 3 clams and some deep fried pork belly and lard. The pork belly was very salty to eat on its own. The chili was average.Oh and you need to take your own plates and cutlery and chili and lime to your table. The service is brusque, not exactly the most friendly. The or luak was not available when we were there and they could not give a simple answer when we asked when it would be available again. It was a most evasive answer which told us nothing. I would only go back again when the or luak is available. And this is the same coffee shop where the famous Ocean Fish Head Curry is.  Note: If you take the bus, alight at Jackson Square. It can be quite a walk from both Braddell and Toa Payoh MRT stations.

Thus, you can imagine I was filled with excitement when my bff suggested that we visit this restaurant. To be frank, I've forgotten how good the food tasted due to the passage of time. But, I'm really happy that everything that we ordered tasted Super!The most enjoyable food was the (1) Garlic Bread - so tender and fragrant with a strong garlic taste .. just the way I like it. Definitely a 5 stars here just for this alone (2) the fried mushrooms - oooooh so tasty & juicy!! A must-try absolutely! (3) Minestrone Soup - flavourful & rich .. really like it a lot (4) Beef Brisket - so tender, juicy they melt in your mouth!Interestingly, the decor has not changed at all since I last visited it. It is not surprising then that I really enjoyed the Super delish meal as I was dining with my very close friend ... and at the same time filled with a strong sense of nostalgia of my past visits to this place with my other close friends.The service was friendly & great! The staff that served us has been working here for more than 10 years. She told us that there has been a change of management. What I'm Glad to know is that there has been no impacts on the food quality.For folks wanting really good & tasty Western food, coming to this restaurant in the North East is definitely a good choice. The prices are really reasonable in view of their food quality & service standards. The beer prices are good too! I believe it's 3 beers for $18 (very reasonable by SG standards)Lastly .. just like to wish everybody a really Marvellous 2020!! Wishing all a Blessed & Wonderful Year!!! First review 2020."

The Works (spiciness ranging from mild to raging hot), Garlic Butter and Peppa Butter. The Works is piquant with an assam-like tang, but not too spicy. With lobsters shipped in daily from US, the taste can hardly go wrong. Sweet and not overcooked, the chunky fleshes might be a hassle to remove from the shells at first but all efforts were rewarded when you mopped down with the sauces.But we soon found out that it's got more to offer than the lobster. Pick from brown crabs, prawns, mussels, clams and then choose your sauce. That said, the heartiest way to round off the evening is to feast on the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139/4); literally a seafood bomb filled with everything including sausages, corns and some deep-fried mantou buns at the side for soaking up the juices. The starters were overall quite impressive too. The Louisiana Spicy Mid Joint Wings ($8.90) were zappy with a nice sour kick that makes you grab for more. The Southern Chicks and Waffles ($9.90) had plenty of crisp, not only in the chicken but more importantly in the waffles that were drizzled in maple syrup. I shy away from the Bacon Shrimp ($11.90) in smoky Hickory sauce because they were too salty. As for the Fish & Chips ($12.90), it's a classic in its own league. The fish stayed moist and piping hot within a light, crunchy batter. The Signature Lobsicle ($15.90), aka lobster on Popsicle, might be safer in the Boiler instead of the deep fryer as they were too chewy.Business was so good that the chocolate molten lava cake ran out of stock and so we settled for the C.B.D, a pungent pun on the business district of Singapore because it stood for Crispy Banana Durians. Forget about the Bananas were substituted by yams that night, cos the pungent durians have already stolen the limelight. As we all know, never judge a restaurant by the history or the location. Despite being opened only for a few months, it's no nonsense when it comes to the Cajun-style lobsters here. Walk in, sit down and put on the apron. We did. And we ate. We ate very well indeed."

It's a queer location for a seafood spot but we absolutely dig the cavernous space and their delicious offerings. It made perfect sense for us to order the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139) since there's a huge group of us (we had 3 bags of that). Each bag feeds more than the recommended 4 pax (that or we are small eaters). Dungeness or Brown Crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, and corn are tossed with a sauce of your choice. For the sauce, there's garlic butter (for the kiddos), pepper butter (for amateurs), mild, medium and raging spice. Of the lot, i thought that the mild worked the best. It was more savory than the bland and boring garlic butter, but not too spicy to give you a heartburn or mar the taste of the seafood. Of the ingredients in the bag, I loved the succulent and juicy prawns, the salty chorizo style sausages, and not to mention the sweet corn! The juicy kernels provided a respite from the spices after a while. Get a lobster ($49) to go with your meal! Same price as Pince and Pints but without the queue (just make a reservation)! I liked this better than the crabs. Lemon butter was a good choice as the sauce is lighter and simpler, which allowed the freshness of the lobster to come through. The pepper butter can be rather overwhelming with spice in my opinion and not quite suitable for this meat.If you're not up for a seafood feasting, you could also do smaller meals such as fish and chips, chicken and waffles, and hot dogs as well. For desserts, we had the Molten Lava cake ($9.90) which remained fairly decent even after all the photo taking. The almond (mocha?) ice cream with Oreo crunch was a hit with us. Skip the fried banana and durian fritters ($7.90) with salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It sounded way more exotic than it tasted and certainly not quite worth the price for fried pisang. Plus it had a stale oily taste.We really enjoyed our meal while it lasted. It was fun passing food around with our bare hands and letting loose at the dining table. However, the gastric reflux was pretty severe and the garlic aftertaste lingered long after the meal concluded. In fact, it's pretty nauseating thinking about it right now. So yes, it's a once in a blue moon indulgence for us. That said, I'd certainly recommend The Boiler for a gathering with family and friends! What's your favorite seafood boil?"

I didn't think it'd be that crowded but boy was I wrong. For a restaurant located in the middle of an industrial zone, on a Sunday night, this place was PACKED. When we got there every table was full, and the nearest roadside parking was two streets down. Surprising, to say the least.But hey, free parking on Sundays and after 5pm (I think) on weekdays means that despite its inaccessibility, it's quite worth driving in!We were a large group of 10 people, so we got to order a fairly broad range of items. We ordered two of their bags (feeds four each), one mildly spicy, one garlic butter. We ordered a lobster (medium spicy) because it was on offer, and plenty of sides. Seafood first.For $140+ per bag, it's good value. You get something like a whole crab, 6-8 pieces of prawns (maybe more, I wasn't counting), sausage, corn, mussels, clams, and some fried buns. The sauces are good too. The garlic butter was buttery rich and very garlicky. My only criticism is that by the time you're reaching the end of the bag, it's really heavy going. Conversely, the spicy sauces are less flavourful when you start out, but so much cleaner and lighter on the palate that you can keep going for longer. Mild spice is pretty disappointing for someone with the average Singaporean spice tolerance. I highly recommend medium. The corn in the bag was good, sweet and not overcooked. The crabs weren't the freshest I'd ever had, but they were still sweet and tasty.I wouldn't bother recommending the lobsicles, which are bite-sized bits of deep fried lobster, despite their fame. There's just nothing special about them. The Momma's Potato Scoops are basically just wedges served with cheese sauce, and the Spam Fries are spammier than most places. Not as crisp as they could have been either. The coleslaw was average, fresh tasting, but it felt very odd eating coleslaw by hand. I also feel the Jamaican alcoholic ginger beer is worth special mention. The alcohol taste is light, the ginger taste strong, and it's a great drink if you love ginger beer in general. (Though it's a bit sweet)The best part of the entire meal was really that, drinks included, everything came out to only $70 per person. Considering the amount we ate? Definitely worth it.

You have been warned!*Pros* The food is decent. The taste of the seafood in a bag is definitely cajun, and well marinated with the works. One whole bag (I can't remember which one I got) had enough crabs, prawns, mussels, cockles, corn and sausages enough for two to share. We also had the boston lobster (the price was on special!) marinated in garlic butter. The mid-joint wings was also pretty decent!*Cons* Missing mallets! Mallets would be helpful, especially for the lobsters! And perhaps extra wet-wipes and napkins? How about putting a kitchen roll at the table?And what happened to the root beer? Cajun-style seafood dinners demand either beer, or root beer if you are driving... And I was driving. The waitress told us that they used to carry root beer, but stopped due to low demand. She also told us a few things were no longer on the menu due to pricing costs, including the every popular lobster-sicle. Recommended: The Works Sauce, no matter what seafood you are getting! The bags are good value.The removal of some essential items that make it a truly Louisiana experience was pretty sad, as I have experienced  authentic US cajun before and unfortunately this was a derivative of the actual thing. But more importantly, which I hope the owners can probably read this, is that the marinade could possibly use a little stronger taste. The seafood is well marinated, but the cajun flavor I feel wasn't strong enough.Overall, knowing that the restaurant is new, I'll give them a thumbs up for their effort, and hope that they can improve the authenticity and overall feel of southern-style seafood!"

The large succulent Prawns are definitely our favourite among all the fresh seafood. The works sauce is spicy and umami!! Will probably be one of our regular seafood joint going forward.

It's located at the first floor of McPherson community centre, and utilises their wifi. It's very spacious, and it's even got a small slide in the corner for kids to play in. I wasn't that hungry, and ended up ordering their truffle fries and their laksa pizza, along with a 'matcha Kopi'.Their menu is pretty extensive and locally inspired, including things like a Chili crab pasta and a salted egg yolk prawn pasta. They also do burgers and pizzas. The laksa pizza I had was interesting conceptually, consisting of their own homemade bread topped with prawns, fishcake, curry leaves and boiled egg. I enjoyed it as it was a thin crust, but honestly it felt more like a glorified bakery bread. It wasn't bad, but at $16.90, it's a little steep. As for the truffle fries, the truffles it was topped with were questionable. However, I have to admit that I really like the layout, and it's very communal. The staff need some work in terms of explaining the menu, but otherwise, I actually really liked the coffee! They also do a salted caramel latte, so next time I might try it. They're apparently famous for their rainbow cake, which looked really delectable, and topped with things like cookies and cream and salted caramel. Overall, seems like a good place to do some studying and work if you're in the area, though more for coffee and dessert than the food, which is a tad overpriced. Might try their pasta next time! Definitely a good concept to put it in a CC, I'll have to come back again and update my review then, with photos of the rainbow cake!"

NOM's interior is set up with several square tables so they can be very flexible with any party size. A great plus point over fixed sized booths, which only accomodate so many people. This is the entrance of NOM at MacPherson Community Club on a tuesday night 8pm. I parked across the street, at the HDB car park and there was a summon aunty walking around checking coupons, so do take note! Cheese and tomato pizza was okay, nothing fancy. Big enough to share. For the kids meal, we got pasta and the gravy tasted fine, except for the pasta penne itself, it was abit hard. Their chicken leg was done pretty decently and the meat pretty much fell off the bone and you wouldn't need a knife to eat this cleanly. So thumbs up for this.I liked it better when they served full portobellos. For $9.90, this is literally one or at most two portobello mushroom caps sliced up, breaded and fried. Totally a rip off.Everyone loved the ribs, even though I found it a bit too hard, there was only one bone in there though. So tons of meat for sharing.Being that this is my second time, I figured I knew what I wanted. But I was so wrong, the quality has dropped. I am not sure if I would be back for the rosti. Refer to my previous review in SEPT/OCT and see the pictures of the Rosti, it looks so different. I even feedbacked to the young waitress whom politely asked if I wanted the Rosti recooked, but I said, forget it, my friends had already dug into it. But even my friend who came in JB, mentioned that Marches' Rosti is so much better and even cheaper than this. So, the newest addition to NOM is their rainbow cheesecakes which I did not see in September. It is quite solid, so I know for sure there's at least 2 blocks of Philadelphia cream cheese in there or more. It can be quite gerlat, so do share it, so just eat it and run 10km at the gym the next day.I had tried their chocolate and oreo rainbow cakes before and this was my first time trying their salted caramel cake. Everyone really liked the salted caramel rainbow cake smile And some of my friends mentioned that they would be back to try other cakes, definitely not the Rosti though. At $8.90 a slice, rainbow cakes here aren't cheap but they're at least decent. The Rainbow cakes were priced at $7.90 a slice just 2 months ago.. :(I'm glad that NOM is sensible enough to price this rainbow cheesecake at $7.90, one dollar less than the rainbow cake itself. Being that I do bake cakes, I also know well that a rainbow cheesecake takes ALOT less time to make than a normal rainbow buttercream/sponge cake.The best upside to NOM is that it is nett priced, but I believe their prices seem to be going up some dumb reason."

It wasn't too crowded, there was just another family there with us. My first impression of the place was that it was bare and clinical, with the stark white walls, cement floor and white tables and chairs. It felt.. cold. The mandopop music played through the speakers made me feel even more like an outsider.I would say the food was average. We had the atlanta eggs benedict, blackstone eggs benedict, truffle fries and chocolate rainbow cake. Let's start with the best part- the cake. We got it only because it's supposedly the thing you must try if you're there. I've never been a fan of rainbow cake because they don't really taste like rainbows (cheat my feelings, you know?), but I'm glad I tried this one. The sponge was moist, fluffy and full of flavour, even without the chocolate icing. The icing was decadent - rich, creamy chocolatey goodness that melts in your mouth (and in your hands, I checked). The truffle fries were amazing as fries, not so much as truffle fries. They were actually cut potatoes and I believe they were air-fried or baked, so they were not greasy. The fries were crispy on the surface and hot on the inside. Unfortunately, we could barely taste the truffles. In terms of taste, the shaved parmesan on top had more impact.The poached eggs were not that great, to be honest. They were almost cold by the time they were served, and one out the 4 was not runny in the middle. Toasting the english muffins and grilling the tomatoes would have improved the dishes, i think.In summary, as NOM is quite out of the way for those who don't live in Macpherson, I think I'd need a stronger reason to go back. The cakes are definitely tempting, so i'd stop by for those if i'm nearby."

Went on a Friday and surprisingly full in the late night. Many were here for the pretty rainbow cakes with assorted creams. Today is the oreo and salted caramel cream. The former is a little dry and the latter a bit too caramel sweet. But its a decent rainbow cake. not overly creamy and the colors of the layers are impressively bright. Not the best rainbow cake I ate (as of now i have tried like A LOT of them) but its up there with a couple of my faves.Savories - sweet potato fries were well done. could have a little more powdered sugar. Truffle Parmesan Fries - alright. The half and half pizza is served in its rectangular form and the crust is thin and filled with herbs (think foccacia bread). an interesting take with the pepperoni and mushroomwith arugula. Overall not a bad pizza. The crust saved the dish.Drinks - as a coffee and chocolate lover I went for the latte which is small and decent (my girlies beg to differ, so you guys try it and let me know). I was attracted to the chocolate drinks especially with african red hot chocolate and chilli hot chocolate in the list. so we ordered them. THEY WERE NOT HOT. Lukewarm at best. *sad face. But the chilli chocolate had that spicy punch after a sip. so that was the saving grace of that. The african red chocolate had nothing to rescue it from its sad lukewarm (and by now cold) state. *sigh The service staff are friendly and one was really honest to let me and my girlies know it was her first day. Not very proactive but attentive when called. So overall not bad. a very young team of girls.For an estate like Macpherson to have such a cafe really brings a twist to the feel of the place. Will come back again to try the other things like their mains, all day breakkies (weekends only hor) and their non cake desserts. Oh they have interesting cheesecakes too. Overall a very good cafe with quality food and a passionate service team. Come here before it gets popular!"

I tried to make a telephone reservation only to be told, ""Just come and queue la, about 20 minutes can get table.."" So on the day before Father's day I came down to queue, I reached about 7pm and true enough, I was told the waiting time was about 20 minutes. In line, you are handed a menu to pick the dishes you want after which a staff will come to pen down your order whilst you wait for your table.The dining area is non air conditioned, but it can be quite airy during the evenings. After we were ushered to our seat, within a few minutes, our dishes started arriving one by one. I guess that's the plus point of ordering, while you're waiting in line!1. Chicken in Pandan Leaf $6I had high hopes for this dish, as I had seen several tables order this and I miss eating this in Thailand.The sauce was sweet and not spicy, the chicken smelt so good, I couldn't wait to tuck in!After I had unwrapped the leaf, I realized that it wasn't one piece of chicken. It looked like chunks of chicken meat with some flour/doughy filler to ""glue"" the pieces of chicken together. Definitely not what I was expecting to eat, and probably a ""cost-cutting"" technique they use. The meat was well seasoned but the flour in between the meat threw me off!2. Beef Kway Teow Soup $4Having eaten at Jai Thai many times and loving their beef kway teow soup, I decided to try the same dish here. Another disappointment as the beef here are just tiny strings of minced beef, rather than actual beef cubes. For the same price, and air conditioning, I would rather eat at clover way. The soup was abit bland and needed some more seasoning as well.3. Pad Thai $4My personal favourite dish and this restaurant's saving grace. Cooked exactly the same way I had eaten at a wet market in Pattaya, the wok hei here was spot on! Yes it was drenched in oil, but the flavours of this dish is so good, I didn't mind the extra calories. This is a must order at Nakhon!4. Olive Fried Rice $6The portion here is too huge for any one man to finish. The rice was subtly flavoured with olive and it wasn't too oily. If you want a healthier choice instead of pineapple fried rice, this is it.5. Asparagus $6The asparagus was cooked well and it was soft. The sauce was salty and it went well with the bland vegetables. 7. Green Curry with Beef $8Probably one of the worst green curry I have eaten, the colour looked off and it didn't have the distinctive green curry flavour. In the bowl, there were tiny strips of beef again, exactly the same as the beef kway teow soup. 8. Red Ruby $3Everyone at the table loved the red ruby, decorated with a slice of a jack fruit on top, there were tons of crunchy red ruby and the coconut milk was just right. It had a good level of ""lemak"" taste.A very cooling dessert to end off the day.Here is our family feast for 4 people. There were hits and misses, sadly mostly misses. Maybe we have to come back and try other dishes, because this coffee shop thai restaurant must be doing something right to have 7 outlets and non stop queues on weekends."

The actual 肠粉 is very good and you can tastes the different from what you get in restaurants. The shrimp is also very fresh and excellent texture.

I have never had a bad meal there though I would recommend being firm on what you want and don't want from their list of ""special items"". I don't like cheese gooped on all my food, so I just eat stuff like the smoked duck. Shin Yuu is great because they have an extensive sashimi selection and the fish is decently fresh and served in generous portions. The sushi, both traditional and fusion, are great. They offer some interesting takes on the grilled or stir fried dishes and the fried soft shell crabs are never disappointing. The servers are good about getting your orders in and I've only had 1-2 gone missing in all the visits I've made. Finally the Singaporean owner/chef is quite personable so if you do get to chat with him he'll crack you up. Shin Yuu to sum up, is a great meal if you're willing to pay for quality (its about $50-60 after service and taxes for dinner), decent service and not have to bother making reservations too far in advance.

Singapore has not disappointed us with the food. Everything is packed with flavor but this little gem gave us that nice meal we wanted without breaking the bank and just downstairs. Definitely give it a try!"

Especially on my recent visit, thoroughly enjoyed the great value of my delicious clams vongole which came with a lot of tasty gravy - fragrant, appetising and a nice balanced tinge of lemon grass sourness, all that at a very affordable price using the one for one deal from the entertainer app. Thumbs up for the excellent service as the waitress gladly complied with my request for additional gravy which pretty much became soup for me, as a passionate soup lover. The recent experience totally made up for an earlier visit where I was slightly disappointed with the pork chop that felt rather stiff, perhaps overcooked. My friends and I enjoyed the recent meal together very much as a whole, at a comfortable cosy ambience."

The Prawn Noodles and Ngoh Hiang Poh Piang probably got something to do with it. The queue here is generally long and the tables fully occupied but the queue and table wait clears fast. The table waiters cleans up pretty fast but sometimes they don't wipe the tables so do prepare some tissues. The place can also get pretty hot especially during hot days due to the ceiling and also the kitchen area. So do find a place outside or near the fan if you are sensitive to heat.There are different variations of the Prawn Noodle and you can have it soup based or dried Prawn Noodle. I always opt for the dry version as I like yo sprinkle loads of chilli powder onto the dried noodles and soup. The only grouse?? Small bowl of well flavoured prawn Soup and it's not refillable. The version I have is usually the Prawn Noodle with Bak Kut and I love how the condiments of the Noodle mixes well with the Chilli Powder. The Bak Kut is also soft and I love how not to ""porky"" it tastes. The Prawns have been slitted and the shell comes off easily. It's really tasty when mixed with the chilli powder and the condiments. Take a mouthful of noodles and then slurp it down with the soup! Yummy!!Usually I would also buy Ngoh Hiang with white fried prawn cracker, Century Eggs, Chinese Sausages, Fried Bean Curd and Fried Fish Balls to go with the meal. The oil that has been used to re-fry some of the items are usually well filtered and changed so you will not expect to have a smelly plate of Ngoh Hiang like in some other places. A good cup of cold barley drink is also my usual to complete my meal! Happy me!!"

On balance, I am inclined to agree, for the eater, gastronomy should as much about the journey as the destination...but I can't help it.  It somehow seems unpatriotic, un-Singaporean, not to take pictures of your food, especially when it's as pretty and aromatic a bowl as the folks at Blanco put together.Ask about this deceptively simple dish and the responses are likely to be as robust and varied as the flavors embodied in the broth.   Can something so simple really be perceived so many different ways?  There is no easy answer, largely because Hokkien prawn noodle soup is not so much a bowl of food as a part of the Singapore story.*   In short, no two prawn noodle experiences are alike, depending on your history, if any, with the dish.  It is precisely because it is as foundational to Singaporean gastronomy and so much a part of Singapore's own brief history, that Hokkien prawn noodle soup can be such an evocative food experience, and why everybody has their own backstory when it comes to this classic of Singaporean hawker fare.   Food is as much about memory as it is about taste, food associated with fond memories will always taste far better than the ingredients or preparation can reasonably make it.  The converse is equally true.  I, for example, get a tightness between the shoulders and am overcome by a sense of resignation and malaise, every time I have green bean soup, the same feeling I used to get during night snacks in basic military training as a raw recruit, but I digress.Blanco's version of Hokkien prawn noodle soup has all the necessary ingredients for lush nostalgia.  The broth is thick and brown, bearing the  gravitas of slowly stewing roasted pork bones and the heady miasma of steeped prawn heads, shells and fish racks. What you notice is the spicy, aromatic, almost nutmeg-like sweet finish, cleansing your palate and waking it up at the same time and readying it for the next mouthful.    Tasting this broth is like falling through a wormhole and coming up on the other side in a simpler time of street-side dining, surrounded by family all perched precariously on rickety stools around a small folding table, their smiling faces just visible through the rising steam of bowls of Hokkien prawn broth, and your mother leaning over to offer you a spoonful of noodle and steamy broth, while you are distracted by a calico stray cat peering out from just beyond the corona of the pushcart noodle stall's pressure gas lamp, eyes bright for the odd table scrap.  The bustle of street traffic, the hiss of the pressure lamp and the boiling broth, the soundtrack to this lush visual memory.More contemporary versions of Hokkien prawn noodle soup feature pork fat less prominently, which I find disturbing.   That layer of pork fat that used to accompany more traditional servings of Hokkien prawn noodle soup was the perfect vessel for all those ancient and subtle flavors, the fat allowed these ethereal and volatile flavors to linger on the palate long enough to be appreciated.  So, the lower the fat content, the less harmonious and more ""one-note"" the broth becomes.  Blanco has a very decent broth, it is bright without being two dimensional.  Hokkien prawn noodle soup lives and dies on the broth alone.  The noodles can be added if one is looking for a more substantial meal, but the broth has been traditionally even been served by itself with the addition of condiments such as bean sprouts, cilantro and kang kong.  Blanco has also faithfully adhered to the traditional addition of chunks of pig tail, something that you don't find all that often any more.  In my book, the folks at Blanco deserve a place in my Hall of Hallowed Gastronomy because of this one thing.  The skin and fat fall off the bone and you slurp and suck your way around the tail bone till its clean.  If you're ordering the 3-in-1 prawn noodle soup, then enjoy the ribs which are fall off the bone tender with the flesh rapidly dissolving in your mouth once off the bone.  There's also wonderfully gelatinous pig skin which is reminiscent of sea cucumber, except porkier.  Cleanse with a mouthful of broth and repeat, and repeat and repeat.  There are a few other details that you are likely  to remember, the alkaline starch of the yellow noodles, the crunch of fresh blanched sprouts, the herbal and almost floral heat of the fresh cut chilies, and the taste of ocean from the prawn flesh, but none of these details, will cling, almost parasitic, in your memory like that the memory of that deep dark broth, whispering secrets going down.* For an excellent summary of what this dish is and its roots, read Bonny Tan's excellent writeup on Infopedia (infopedia.nl.sg/articles…)."

Best that its free flow and a big warm pot of it was kept by the side table for you to refill.The Prawn Roll looks abit dry here rather than the glossy appearance but we were all glad that it was not greasy.

Every piece was well immersed in the ""Lor Chap"" aka Braised Sauce and just goes very well on the plate.Braised Duck with Tau Kwa - $16 (Small)If you eat Pig's Intestine, you will definitely like this as these braised intestine was well handled and does not have any gamy taste. In fact the combination of salted vegetable and intestine had executed well.Braised Pig Intestine with Salted Vegetable - $9 (Small)Forget about the calories, the stew pork is definitely awesome.

I think it's the only tasting menu where I really enjoyed every dish (though I do have to say I think it's on the pricy side for what it is in terms of ingredients etc).As someone who did not grow up in Singapore, I believe people who did may be able to relate better to the story behind each dish and the flavors since they are inspired by local ingredients and childhood memories of dishes. It's great for anyone who doesn't like to eat raw things (fish or undercooked meat). Space is bright and very comfortable. Portion size is just right.

With her fastest fingers, check yelp first lah! Wow. Good reviews on yelp! Must try! The menu is categorised into aglio olio, tomato based and cream based pasta. Price range between $7 to $10. Very affordable lunch for workers in the area. There are some uncomfortable side seats where you face their busy work area & the table makes my legs awkward. I chose a seat at the corner so that i can sit sideway to enjoy my meal. You order, pay, get your receipt with q nos and wait for your number to be called. The staff has a super bright smile and happily entertained my request of putting chili padi in my pasta. You have no idea how this made me so so so delighted. Haha. I love chilli padi in my cream pasta & had a runny nose for a week already. That chilli really made my day. He look very happy putting up my request & even ask cheekily: you want more cheese?! Hehe. Oh my.. Because of him, im giving another 1 star. Ok here comes my pasta. The cream is so thick & very generous portion! With slices of chicken breast, edamame, tonnes of herbs & spags, this $7 of goodiness is the best food i had in the week. (Been eating plain food.. Zzz) I love it & will return again.

Being fish lovers, my mum would lovingly search for fresh fish at the market. But when we want 'ang moh' fishes, it may not be so easy to find it at local wet markets. Greenwood has a good variety and they advised my mother which fishes are suitable for grill for our barbeque once and after chatting, my mother ordered the next batch of fresh wild salmon from them. She grumbles that the farm bred ones have a taste and smell about them that loses the 'fishiness' that she likes about the oily fish. We also bought scallops which were fresh and they had quite good seasonal offerings.However, their prices are rather steep and unless it's for an occasion, it might be rather hefty to do groceries here on a daily/ weekly basis."

It looked a rustic mess, but was deliciously value-for-money. Standouts include the squid and octopus, both were executed flawlessly.3) Squid Ink Linguine ($21.95) - slicked with the moreish essence of squid ink: I liked that it was generously dotted with perfectly cooked calamari.4) Scallop Cioppino ($23.95): an unusual but wonderful combination of spinach pesto-ed spaghetti and spicy arrabiatta, but let down by overcooked rubbery scallops.5) White Truffle Linguine ($23.95) - white truffle tapenade swirled into parmesan cream, and flecked with shitake aplenty: waaaay too rich, this got cloying about halfway through.6) Char-Grilled Atlantic Halibut ($32.95): delicate and beautifully burnished, drizzled with a velvety herbed butter, and sided by grilled asparagus, broccoli and marinated cherry tomatoes.

We parked nearby after driving from Marymount, and almost couldn't find the place too! So glad we ate here."

My friend and I came about 11:50am and they were just about to get ready to open. At 12, they open their doors and welcomed us in. The place looked a little old but had some kind of relaxed feeling which I likedTook our orders, my friend had the chicken wrap while I had the first thing that was on the main course which was chicken schnitzel and we shared their curried fries as well. The food came promptly since there was no other customers, but the servings were really large and tasty. It was really good.  The waiter working there was friendly as well and its definitely a place for people to come down and have a long comfortable chat with one another while enjoying good food.For those driving, I would recommend parking at Thomson Plaza and then walking over to the cafe.

The food here is not remarkable but decent enough, some items I have ordered are the Curry Fries (absolutely delicious), Shepherd's Pie (not bad), Chicken Schnitzel (good) and Pomodoro Chicken Wrap (average). You can choose your poison of choice from the wide selection of beers and ciders. On my last visit, a friend ordered a new cider they had just brought in (can't remember the name but it was strawberry flavoured) and it was good, not overly sweet like most other fruit ciders. My only gripe is that the prices of the food is a bit more expensive than what I would pay for at such a location.

You can't go wrong with a freshly made crepe. This tasted good but did not wow. The crepe was light and crisp on the outside, so that was good but the filling was just OK for me. Would have appreciated more chicken in the crepe. Further, before ordering, I had asked the server if there was sauce in the crepe. She said that there was ""tomato"" in the crepe which I understood to mean ""tomato sauce"" given my question . Turns out, there was no sauce, but tomatoes. Fine with me, since I wouldn't have wanted sauce in any case. It would have been nice if the cafe had a choice of batter for the crepe - e.g. wholewheat etc.The wholegrain mustard buffalo wings were good. For the price of the can drinks at $3, I would have expected them to be chilled. Maybe I'm picky, but a warm can of coke, even when poured into ice, tastes different from a chilled can of coke. It's less gassy. Also, do make reservations as I was turned down once when the place was packed for dinner."

It is just a convenient place to bring visitors if they want to try hainanese chicken rice and do not need to sweat it out at a hawker centre.This experience is the same. The chicken is tender and moist but not exactly flavorful and it doesn't reach my definition of succulent. We tried their new vegetable dish of fried mushrooms with green veg. The fried mushrooms are too sweet as it is coated with honey. The coating is so sweet that you can't taste the mushrooms.Service was very attentive and courteous.FYI. They now give you two chargeable appetizers: peanuts ($1.50) and honey glazed pork ($3). So remember to say no if you do not want them.

Very quiet yet filled with quite a bit of people. We were quickly brought to our seat and began ordering.The waiter, Laura, was very helpful in helping us choose food for the night. She told us about the specials that night and offered a few very delicious foods for us. In the end, we decided on Burrata Cheese with Pama Ham, rocket veggies and tomatoes. We also ordered a Parmiagiana crab meat pizza and a Vongole.The Burrata Cheese arrived in record time - about 5 minutes. The food would have taken at least 2 hours in other restaurants. The cheese was separate and had to be cut by a knife. The cheese sliced like butter. It was delicious! The Parma Ham was a great roll for the cheese too and the Rocket veggies and the tomatoes were just perfect. At just $40, I feel that although the food and price is reasonable, the cheese might be a little too much and maybe they can reduce the portion so we don't have to pack back home. Save the environment you know? Use less plastic right eh eh?The Vongole arrived as we finished the Burrata Cheese and boy was it good! The clams were superb and the noodles were excellently cooked and made. Just perfection. Enough said.Finally, the Parmiagiana arrived and boy was it fantastic! The cheese was chewy and delicious and every part of the pizza was bursting with flavor, leaving you craving for more. All I can say is: perfect... can't type anymore it's so good..........Overall, the meal was 'wunderbar!' And it was definitely worth the price of 160 in total which I think is quite reasonable considering the quality of the food. Will come again!!!!"

There is no bus going there, so it's Uber. The decorations are contemporary and consistent of well placed art pieces. This minimizes the distraction when you look inside to the covered open kitchen. You see the chef going about making pizza and other good Stuff.You wait outside while they get your table ready. We were there on a Sunday night without reservations. The restaurant was pretty full but we had our table quickly. The staff was smiling a lot and was friendly.We Ordered the standard stuff...Hawaiian pizza, spaghetti Bolognese & bacon fettuccine. The pizza had thin crust, with juicy pineapple and slices of ham. It was cooked, somewhat not too well as the middle was soggy. You cannot hold up the slices of pizza as it was soft and soggy. However there was sufficient ingredients on it.The Bolognese was made with finely minced meat, so fine that it formed into a meatless sauce. I am sure I felt the meat fibre between my teeth, so there was meat in it. Unfortunately the tomato sauce was too light so it tasted salty and not the tomato in the sauce.The bacon fettuccine was however good. There were pieces of mushroom, dried tomatoes and pieces of bacon in a white oily creamy sauce. It was very rich and tasted great. The noodle was done just soft enough and the sauce clink on to it.Dessert was the tiramisu and lava cake with gelato. The tiramisu was very good but lacked the usual alcohol. Guess it is a child friendly restaurant. The lava cake was moist and warm and goes well with the gelato. Given the distance and difficulty to get there, or if you have a car, to find a proper parking lot, it might not worth the effort. However if you around that area, it is a OK restaurant to go."

So while everyone else in the packed restaurant was ordering ""Western"" food, we tried the more exotic menu.The set menu came with garlic bread and pumpkin soup. Even for Nepalese dishes. This was a little odd but it meant I got to try some other stuff. The soup wasn't bad. Unusually for pumpkin soup it had (pumpkin) seeds in it. The soup had a strong savory base; usually pumpkin soup is a little sweeter and thicker than this (and tastes more of pumpkin - the flavour was very settle here), but it was still decent. The garlic bread was usual Hainanese-style Western food garlic bread, i.e. edible.For appetisers we had chicken momo, which looked liked xiaolongbao. It tasted of South Asian spices though, and there was no juice flowing from inside. The chili it was served with was a little sour and slightly spicy; it didn't have any particular character, but then I'm not a fan of chili. This dish was so-so.We also had pork choila. It was served with lightly flavoured pilaf rice, and radish achar (pickles) which were near flavourless. The pork was cool (not even lukewarm) and slightly spicy, but had no particular character.The Nepalese roast chicken was better, though it was served with ""Western"" style vegetables. It was warm and tender (though not moist). The spice blend was tasty and it had a bit of en edge compared to generic roast chicken. The first taste was great but the flavour got boring after a while. Also the flavour clung to the surface and didn't penetrate the chicken well, so it was inconsistent. Nonetheless it was the best of the 3 dishes. Which probably explained why I saw 2 other people having it (while no one else was having the Nepalese menu).The set menu also came with coffee, tea or Milo. Yes, Milo.The cake that came with the set was normal - nothing unusual either way and par for the course for Singaporean-style Western food.I also had the apple pie for takeaway. It was quite mediocre, albeit eaten a few days later (which might've affected the flavour a little).The service was okay, cantankerous sign plastered everywhere notwithstanding. Oh, and despite the Mastercard-sponsored table reservation tokens, they don't accept credit cards.This place has no air-conditioning so it's just a cheap neighbourhood haunt which lets you try something exotic (the ketchup in squeeze bottles is another clue about the market positioning). Though I suspect you might be better off with the ""Western"" food."

They plate 4 pieces on a home-made potato crust and seasonal vegetables. The vegetables were well marinated and sauté too. The potato crust thingie is a little weird for me. No like.

I asked him to compare to Aston's and he said that Aston's serving seemed to be bigger, taste-wise, about the same. 3) Grilled Chicken and fillet combo - I found the fish fresh and generous in serving. Chicken was ok too. Nothing spectacular but no bad. We only order one set so we had corn and potato soup to start. The soup was home-made and has bits of corn and potato in it. Very nice.

He told me that this restaurant is opened by a couple who used to work as chefs there. I loved their pasta dishes, grilled fish, mushroom soup, coleslaw (yummy and handmade). I heard the steak is really delicious too. The prices are very affordable but the food is high quality. You can feel the effort put in by the chef to prepare each dish and the quality + presentation of the food is 5 star! I personally feel that for that kind of price, it's really difficult to find another place like this in Spore with good food and service.The decor is simple, clean and neat. Service is prompt and friendly. The chef is willing to make some changes to the food item if you tell them. For me personally, this is the place to go for fuss free good western food."

The bacon and mushroom pastas are okay, and you can tell that they do put in effort in making the sauces, but it just lacks a little flavor. The bacon is nice and crispy though. The pasta is overcooked, like how some locals like it. The coleslaw is on the creamy side, but has a good flavor. The pork chop was the sar of the meal, perfectly cooked through but still moist and juicy. Could use a bit more flavoring but can't complain.

For my foreigner friends, ""teochew"" is a Chinese dialect.My family has dined here on several occasions and most recently 2 weeks back, we felt the quality and taste were generally good with some hits and misses. But based on our visit yesterday, we realized that food quality consistency wasn't there. Service was also not that great. First ups, we had already pre-reserved 2 cold crabs for dad's dinner, but was told that they didn't have stock this week. I think this is bad customer service, they had ample time to call me and inform me but didn't do so. And they weren't apologetic over it at all! Being dad's birthday, I didn't want to kick up a fuss. But this is major!! We then decided to replace it with crayfish. Here's what we ordered:1. Longevity buns - ok2. Cold dish - good3. Pork ribs king - good 4. Sliced beef with spring onion - bad - the version we ate 2 wks ago was tender and succulent but yesterday's were tough and starchy 5. Kai lan - ok 6. Crayfish - not great - Sambal sauce was a tad salty and it felt that the salt wasn't evenly distributed 7. Winter melon chicken soup - good8. Teochew style steamed pomfret - good9. Efu noodles - no good - bland with only 1 sliced black mushroom on the plate - huh?!?9. Dessert was Orh-nee or ""steamed yam with pumpkin and ginkgo nuts"" - ok We didn't order teochew braised duck or fish maw with sea cucumber because it wasn't that great 2 weeks ago. Overall, I think it could be a situation where the main chef was on medical leave and someone else took over, or he was having a bad day. Whatever it is, if it's a special occasion family dinner you dine at your own risk. If it's a normal family dinner, it's fine."

But my unagi was well hidden inside and let's just say that they are bits n pieces that combined to about an inch and a half size.Carbonara pasta was merely edible after adding Tabasco sauce.The cornflakes chicken waffle is a dish that is refreshing to me. However, the first few mouth were too overwhelming for me. The chicken is covered with lots of cornflakes. It's too oily for my palate. The sweet smelling aroma that ended with a bad taste in the mouth got me even more disappointed. Waffle at Prima deli is even way more delicious than this.The seafood baked rice picture on the menu has salmon in it. We were deceived by it. When it came, it was practically baked rice with a few of mussels. And it tasted better with Tabasco.Even the only presentable decent one was the chicken katsu rice. Even then the rice is not fragrant for that price that we pay for.Try it for yourself and be your own judge. I have a high benchmark for food so I am definitely not going to come here for a meal. But i wouldn't mind a cup of drink to chill out watching our furry friend mingle. Despite the taste of the food, this cafe makes a good chill out place with your furry friends. Especially on weekends, when there are more people in the cafe, it makes a good boundary where the furry friends can mingle."

I mean Authentic Taiwan Cuisine is the name of the restaurant when you check in on Foursquare so there. More specifically though, the restaurant does authentic Taiwanese home-cooking. This tiny eatery has a homey feel to it  - it's like you're in someone's living room with the lady proprietress taking your orders and the one cook in the back whipping out homestyle dishes. We ordered an eggplant stew, a spicy caramelized catfish dish, and their three cup chicken. Flavors overall were nice and went well with rice or porridge. If you had to nit, the way the chicken was butchered resulted in little chards of bone that you had to pick through. The catfish had many tiny bones too so be careful. I think it's all indicative of home cooking versus a restaurant. Little details matter but the food is decent and worth a try. For bringing something different to the neighborhood, Authentic Taiwan Cuisine is a cool addition. They have special bentos too that are only available during lunch if you would like to try the restaurant then."

We were served by a lady server and as we ordered a couple of dishes for 4 person, she said very loudly that we should not order so many dishes because her paper could not accommodate.

Big mistake! The place is pretty small and is filled with customers who purchased the same vouchers from Deal.Com. It took a while before anyone notice us. We were given a round table and in a typical loud Taiwanese tone, we were told that they are very packed and fully booked for the day, hence we only have 1.5 hour for our lunch before we clear the table for the next round. Fair enough. We proceeded with the ordering. Not knowing the portion, we tentatively ordered a few items just to try out. On the menu, some side dishes are listed under the header of ""Self Service"" and since there is a counter by the side with the stated side dishes, we assumed that we are supposed to go get those items ourselves. However, when we were trying to help ourselves, a male staff told us impatiently that we just need to place the order and the items will be served to us. Quite contradicting. After first round of ordering, we waited for around 15 minutes before the dishes started arriving. Most of the dishes (Bean Paste Noodle, Tian Bu Lah, Fried Salted Chicken, Ma Pu Duo Fo, etc)  are so so in taste and not fantastic in appearance. Though, I have to say that items like the Double Sausage Rolls is pretty ok. We waited some more for the rest of our dishes to arrive... but it never happens. Hence we decided to proceed with the second round of ordering. After waving our hands wildly to get the attention of the serving crews, and waiting for yet some more, finally the same male staff attended to us. We placed our order and then proceeded to wait. After waiting for close to 20 minutes, still nothing is served. That is when we tried our best to get the attention of the serving crews. However, all 3 of them seemed so busy and never see our hands all waving into the air to get their attention. Left with no choice, we have to wait again. We waited for another estimated 10 minutes before we also raise the white flag and left without being served the outstanding items from the first order and any items from the second order. Conclusion: While I understand the need to restrict the customers' lunch duration to 1.5 hours in view of the crowd generated from the sales of vouchers from Deal.Com,  it is not acceptable if out of the 1.5 hours duration, at least an hour is spent waiting. I estimated our actual eating time to be less than 20 minutes. There are probably about 4 to 5  tables inside the eating place and another 3 to 4 tables outside. And all the customers are using vouchers, meaning, they have to call up for reservation first. It is ridiculous that the serving crews are unable to manage such a low capacity, especially when the workload can be predicted from the reservations received. And if weekday lunch vouchers are purchased, the customers likely will have limited lunch time and would have to get back to work pretty soon. I cannot help but think that they are playing delaying tactics so that customers like myself and my colleagues who need to go back to work have no choice but to leave even though we have barely consume anything. In addition, some of the items that we ordered do not even need much preparation. Like the Stew Minced Meat Rice, there is a rice cooker at the side counter filled with rice and a slow cooker beside it filled with the stew minced meat. How difficult is it to just scoop some rice on a bowl and pour some stew minced meat over it to serve? Will definitely not return back to this place again even if it is FOC and will not recommend to anyone."

Both of which, really tasted like the name of the ice cream!Aglio Seafood and Vongole $16.9First up, their signature dish, made with fresh Tiger prawns, squid, vongole, seafood broth, cooked in a classic Aglio Olio style. Clarence explained that the type of seafood used in this dish varies, as per fresh seafood supplies.Some weeks, he can get fresh Tiger prawns from the straits of Melaka, sometimes, if it's a Malaysian holiday, the fishermen take the days off and he is unable to get that some seafood. However, you are still guaranteed fresh seafood in your dish, as the owners of Grazie will still source for other seafood to substitute. Clarence also shared that he likes big squid rings in his dishes, and hence the sizeable chunk of yummy squid are evident in the dish.2. Chicken Ballotine $15.90Chicken thigh wrapped with minced pork and spinach, served with cranbeery sauce, purple cabbage and home made potato mash. The mash was rather addictive, though served cold, made the dish rather flavourful. This was my first time having a ballotine and I did like the sweet cranberry sauce, it reminded me of a certain swedish furniture brand's meatball sauce. The meat however tasted a bit bland for my liking.3. Mushroom soup $6.90Check out the pastry baked upon the soup. Light brown and crisp in texture, covering the mushroom soup. The mushroom soup is also made from scratch using white button mushrooms and shitake mushrooms. The soup was more of a mushroom puree than a mushroom soup, lots of chunks of mushrooms could be seen in dish. I really liked the heart-warming taste to this soup and would definintely be back to try their Pumpkin soup $6.90 too!~4.  Speculoos Latte Iced $6.50Served with whipped cream and oreo crumbs, this was a nice drink to cool off the hot weather, despite only having walked less than a hundred metres from the car park. Pictured here is cold Yuzu brewed tea $6, a very interesting concoction I must say. A refreshing drink if you're feeling heaty.5. Yin Yang Waffles with ice creamIf you can't decide what waffles to get, buttermilk or charcoal, how about getting both? Served with Grazie's in-house made chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Both ice creams had different textures. The chocolate was abit more coarse and sweeter, whereas the vanilla was milkier and not as sweet, together they went really well with the crispy waffles. For crispy waffle lovers, take note the waffles here are totally your thing!They also have other ice cream flavours like Cranberry,  Thai Iced Tea and Caramel.Overall : Grazie has moved up from their humble hawker location to a nice location in Whampoa West. Their menu has significantly grown in variety to offer desserts, drinks and more. The owners are very passionate about food and they take pride in serving the freshest ingredients in every dish. Definitely try their pastas and waffles!There's a opening promotion of 10% discount till end of September 2017"

Easy to use and fuss free with photos showing what the order looks like. Good for single or two orders. Complicated orders should use the human cashier. Food as usual is good value for money and I always have the soya sauce chicken. Sometimes with the noodles and sometimes with the hor fun. Love that the noodles are done in the HK style with the right amount of chewiness.

The working crowd has dissipated and its all alone for me and my chicken. First of all, I followed the guy before and ordered extra noodles for the soya sauce chicken. Boy was I shocked at the huge quantity of noodles and wondered if I were able to finish it. After the first bite.. the chewiness, the sauce, the chilli paste, the green chillies I added... oh so many emotions. I may be exaggerating slightly, but it ain't totally.The noodles were chewy, and not disappointing. It soaks up and pairs with the soya sauce pretty well. The sauce is a little sweet and very flavourful. Noodles paired well also with the refreshingly cold green chillies. Next surprise: the chillies they gave. It's not spicy as I thought it would; in fact it was very mild, but there is a ever-so-slight prawn paste taste to it. I love it! Soya sauce chicken was tasty and the chicken is not like fantabulous so keep your expectations around there. Although its one michelin star, its hawker food for the masses after all. Chicken's soft enough for me and I quite enjoyed it. I just wish there were lesser bones. Some people said that the one in Smith Street is better; I hope to try that out someday. For now, this brings soya sauce chicken to a consistently good level.  Seriously impressed!"

The wait is still at least 20 minutes on a Sunday after 2pm. If you are dining in, you need to get a table first before placing your order. There is a machine which accepts cash for takeaway orders. So you place your order and the queue number is written at the top. Go to the pick up area and wait for your number to be flashed on the board. If there is more than 10 or 15 digit gap, go outside and walk around. The chicken is nice but I think the one at the original hawker stall in Chinatown food center is better. The white meat is not as tender here. Same for the char siew and sio bak. I like the noodle and the sauce though. For just under $5 a plate, this is better quality food and value than those served at generic food courts or coffee shops. I will still come here as it is near home and parking is easy. Once the underpass from Tai Seng MRT to the building is open, this will be even more accessible."
