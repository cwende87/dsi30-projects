Especially as I love actual spicy Thai food with bite. The lunch sets are solid and come with drinks like lime juice. My favorites are tom yum soup noodles, beef noodles soup (very fragrant soup), pineapple rice set which comes with green curry and pandan chicken and a few other sides, green curry. The basil chicken is popular & it uses actual chili padi & packs a punch!This place also gives me the feels because it's a very popular RI/RJ haunt, and I've come countless times with different groups of friends. It's a very casual feel with no frills decor, but always clean. I also frequently visited the purvis street location last summer as it was close to my internship, and discovered other great dishes like mango sticky rice, papaya salad, omelette, pandan chicken and so on.

There's always a crowd for sunday evenings, even for an area like clover way.The food is great, all of it. And the price is too! Only thing that i found expensive were the drinks. Thai milk tea at $2.50, not so cheap.  The restaurant floor is run by just 2 guys whom will seat you down, take orders and serve them. Just 2 only but no complains, service is decent and efficient if i might say. Only accepts cash payment only. So always check your wallet before ordering away on those irresistible yummies!"

On Google maps it looks like there should be a short cut rather than having to get to Junction 8 first and ""hiking"" into the little enclave of Clover Way. Anyway, enough of the Bear Grylls stuff, Jai Thai is situated in a nondescript row of modern shophouses book ended by two coffee shops. It's nothing fancy inside, brightly lit with cheaper furniture, but this place isn't about the decor, it's about the food. You shutdown with a menu, pencil and paper and order from the large two sided menu. When ordering from a Thai restaurant for the first time, my theory is that you have to order Tom Yum seafood soup and Green Curry Chicken in order to do a true comparison. This we did accompanied by beansprouts stir fried with salted fish and chicken with holy basil. For drinks we ordered a Thai Chendol  and a Thai iced tea. Service was swift and we settled in for a great meal. The Tom Yum did not have the coloring you see in many restaurants, but was very spicy. The seafood consisted of Octopus, fried fish and prawns, and the ratio of seafood to soup was very generous. Did I mention it was spicy?  The green curry was delicious.  Thick, creamy with a flavor of coconut and very spicy also. Generous chunks of chicken with this vegetables I never remember the name of, but you only see in a Thai green curry. The bean sprouts were crunchy and flavorful, and while unable to vouch for the holiness of the basil, the chicken with holy basil was a delightfully spicy dish. For sure, all dishes were spicy, but hey, it's a Thai restaurant right?  It was also easy to avoid the devilish little chili padi if you wanted to. The drinks were enough to cool down any mouths on fire. Prices were very reasonable and we will certainly be returning. Now if only we could find that short cut."

Fried carrot cake is where my interest lies. The stall supplies both ""white"" and ""black"" fried carrot cakes. ""White"" simply means no soy sauce is added, so the carrot cake has its original plain colour. It looks almost like a plate of fried egg. Customers can choose to order fried carrot cakes priced at S$2.50 or S$3 depending on how much they want to eat. The cook also normally asks if the customer wants chilli to be added. I like the ""white"" fried carrot cakes sold here. Its taste is not too plain, yet not too salty. I seldom eat the ""black"" fried carrot cakes as its colour isn't visually appealing enough. The stall owner is relatively efficient when preparing customers' orders. A plate of fried carrot cake is usually ready within minutes."

The place was pretty busy for 3:00 PM on a Sunday. There were still a few empty tables and several more were leaving so we were seated immediately. The service was definitely their weak point. All visible staff were focused solely on cleaning the dirty tables, leaving several newly seated tables unattended. Fortunately, things went up from there. We ordered an Asahi (the only beer they stock), a cold sake, edamame, mixed tempura, and shichimi curry wings.  Everything was good, but the mixed tempura was my favorite. It had prawns, mushrooms, zucchini, sweet potato, a boiled egg (!!!) and lotus root.All in all, I thought it was a nice break from our afternoon shopping and worth another try for some more serious menu selections."

There's no other word for it. It had not a shade of crispiness at all.The plain prata was alright, being fluffy enough (and a little crispy).What pulled down these two were, I suspect, the mass production, with the staff flipping them on and off the griddle at a quick pace. Despite the quick turnover, the quality suffered, which was surprising.My 2 other orders were more unique and they turned out much better.The cheese prata was pretty good. It was crispy and light (though it was a bit lighter on the cheese than other places). Take out the cheese inside and it would be everything a plain prata should be.The best of all was the bomb prata (prata with margarine and sugar inside). Most bomb prata is very dense and heavy-tasting (which is not necessarily a bad thing) but the bomb here was very light and flaky, and even those with an aversion to oil and/or sugar would probably not find this one too oily and/or sweet (then again, if you don't like oil you shouldn't be eating roti prata in the first place).Oh, and despite the reviews here they weren't selling coin prata that day. Possibly because of the long queue (it only comes in a set, for one).Where this place shone was the curry. The fish curry was robust and full of flavour (and also a little spicy), rather than being the watered down slop you find at many places."

In addition, I know of some who would drive down specially just to satisfy their prata cravings. Hence, upon hearing all these, I just had to check this out.Sin Ming Roti Prata does not only sell pratas. They also sell Nasi Briyani, Nasi Goreng, Mee Goreng, Mutton and even Curry Fish Head. Nevertheless, their prata seems to be more popular. I ordered a Plain Prata $0.90 and an Egg Prata $1.50. I had to wait for around 15 minutes as there was several customers ahead of me. The pratas are made freshly and cooked on the spot upon order which is something that I appreciate. Nothing beats freshly made and freshly cooked prata!How was the prata? The exterior of the Plain Prata was slightly crispy while the interior was soft and chewy. I was disappointed at the lack of crispiness and also felt that it was too chewy. The shiokness of the crispiness and soft combination was lacking. As for the Egg Prata it was similar, lacking in the crisp factor. The fish curry was good, but not fantastic.I like my prata crispy, so well this is not for me. For me, I would still prefer having my prata from the Prata Place. Somehow, I did not feel satisfied with the prata from Sin Ming Roti Prata. If you prefer a less crispy (soft) and chewy prata, then this is for you! Its a matter of personal preference.

Being that it was Mother's Day the place was quite crowded. Nice selection of pizza, salads, pasta , antipasto, and wine on the menu. There are those who love it and then those who says a true pizza liver would never ... the Hawaiian, like it or hate it, I'm reviewing it cause that's what we ordered. The pizza arrived and all I wanted to say to it was ""oh, slice to meet you"" but my belly did most of the talking. It was genuinely good and I have to say that everything on that pie was nice and balanced. I would've prefer fresh pineapples (hey, this is Singapore after all, am I right?) over the can kind, but hey, most do it with the preserved stuff anyways. Can't figure out what kind of ham it was (shaved luncheon?) but it worked.  The cheese and sauce was nice too. The only grumble I have is that the crust could've used a little more color, so another minute or two would've been perfect. But the kitchen seemed exceptionally busy so things may have been a bit rushed.The Spaghetti do frutti de mare was pretty decent with a generous portion of seafood. The sauce was a little too mellow and watery for me but okay, I'll eat it. A sprinkling of parmesan on top to finish off the dish would've been nice. Food coma setting in ... I wonder if that's why it's called a piZZzzzza?Service was really brisk and attentive by the well staffed front of the house. It didn't seem staff were assigned and everyone pitched in to provide great service. Will be back to try more from the menu."

Finding good pizza in Singapore has been the one difficult challenge of moving here six months ago, and I had high hopes for La Pizzaiola given positive reviews from fellow Yelpers. I ordered the Prosciutto Funghi Pizza expecting a toasty, deliciously thin pizza with fresh ingredients and was very underwhelmed. The mushrooms were from a can (not fresh), and the prosciutto just tasted like cold cut ham taken out of a plastic bag from Cold Storage. There was nothing else on the pizza that made it tasty nor distinct. I was hugely disappointed (see photo attached). The location is also in a highly residential neighborhood that is at least a 10 minute walk from the Serangoon MRT station. There are no buses that will take you this far in, either. Given how inconvenient the location was and how mediocre the pizza toppings were, I do not foresee myself returning here again."

We had found a new great restaurant. It came with thinly sliced prosciutto crudo, salad, and a few cherry tomatoes. Heaven.I think this was the same item as the $36 cheese appetizer we got priced out of at Valentino, except here it was $18.Here is their menu: lapizzaiola.com.sg/image…The other salad we had was also awesome, rucola with sundried tomatoes. The pizza was really good, not quite as phenomenal as the appetizers, but still excellent. We had the diavola, and at that point I was so excited and happy that it had arrived at our table that I forgot to take a picture.There is supposedly another location at Telok Ayer, which for all intensive purposes is closer to everything. It looks like their Ghim Moh location may have closed. I will do some sleuthing and report back."

Especially during the peak dinner time, you could end up waiting close to an hour. Cos there's really nothing much around, you can't 'walk off' and come back later unless checking out houses in the private estate is your thing.Some hot favorite includes their rocket and Parma pizza which I simply adore. The appetizer, some kind of a tomato base sauce with meat and mushroom on mashy-like dough was pretty good too. (apologies for the lousy description but I really can't remember the name).We tried the chef's specialty the first time i went there. It looked interesting with the dough baked over the pasta bowl with a mushroom and meat stew inside. We were told it's a classic Italian dish from the country side thus not many restaurant serve it. It taste ok. I feel it's a practical dish cos the people in the country would need their supply of starch and carbs to help them get through their day working hard in the fields but taste wise, nothing extraordinary. Their desserts look pretty good in the menu but I always save space for dessert at the cafe next door thus never had the chance to try. I do enjoy going there cos the service is good with attentive servers always coming by to check on you no matter how busy they are. Though the manager may get a little flustered trying to arrange tables while ensuring diners are still well served, he's a real sweetheart who make sure all customers are happy.If you can't finish the food, fret not, cod they'll gladly help you pack in a take-away box with a nice paper bag."

Gooey melted cheese, on thinly sliced eggplant and tomato sauce. Yummy.Pizza comes in one size - 12 inch. It's good enough to share among two persons. The ruccola-parma ham pizza has the most generous serving of ruccola on a pizza that I've seen. If you don't like the bitterness of this leave, then you will probably hate this. I love ruccola, so this pizza wins for their generous sprinkling of the leaves.Pizza dough - it is not thick, it is also not crispy thin. I like my pizza crispy, yet chewy, with a smokey wood-fire scent.....think Neapolitan pizza....this is not quite like it yet.

We accepted and parked ourselves at that table for all of 2mins before a waitress came up to us to tell us that another spot has become available and if we moved, we wouldn't have to rush through dinner.We had the parma ham pizza and it was really good. I like more ham on mine while my girlfriend likes more rocket on hers so we were both pleasantly surprised when the pizza arrived with lots of both. The pizza was soft yet very slightly crispy and the rocket was as fresh as it could get. The ham was nice because it wasn't too salty like parma ham sometimes is. We also had a codfish that was really good. The fish was cooked for just the right time, so it retained its freshness inside without being too dry.I also ordered the ""default"" beer that I usually have at these Italian joints which was the Birra Moretti and it was a perfect way to top the meal off. There are more beers to choose from of course but the Moretti is always the best compliment to an Italian meal. They have a wide selection of desserts to choose from but we skipped to try dessert next door at wimbly loo instead."

We'd thought it wouldn't be too crowded since it's quite secluded but wow their business is so good!! But it's no surprise because their food is really good, and their prices are really affordable considering how good their food is!! We also found out that it is the second branch of the original La Pizzaiola at Jalan Riang, the one we went to is at Teacher's Estate, Kalidasa Avenue, but the menu is the same.We had a garlic bread for starters, but it's not the usual garlic bread. When it was served we were kinda surprised because it looked like a garlic pizza! But it was still really satisfying! There wasn't a very overpowering taste of garlic, which allowed us to taste the fragrant and delicious pizza base. I looove the doughy taste of the pizza, it was so yummy I couldn't stop eating!! Garlic bread was $6.90 which is so amazing cos it came out as a full pizza!!We also had the Diavola pizza, with spicy salami and tomato and mozzarella. Same as the garlic bread, the pizza was really fragrant and delicious. The spicy salami wasn't too spicy but it gave a nice kick and overall the pizza wasn't too meaty! By the way, their chili flakes are authentic and fresh, and VERY spicy! The pizza cost $14.90. So affordable!!!We also had an Aglio E Olio, which was less impressive, and a Risotto al Funghi, which is one of the better risottos I've ever had :)But I gotta say, what absolutely sealed the deal for my family was the desserts we had! We had a home-made Pear cake and a Melting Chocolate cake (lava cake) served with vanilla ice cream. The pear cake was sooo fluffy and the lava cake was possibly the best I've ever had?? Both weren't overbearingly sweet and the flavors were so balanced, my family was so full but we demolished the cakes within seconds. Overall the bill amounted to $82 for 4 of us, including service charge and GST. We didn't order wine or drinks though. We are definitely going back!!!Please check out my blog (on my profile) for photos :)"

This is a gem in a quiet neighborhood, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting much at the beginning. The prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. I had the squid ink gnocchi in crab meat sauce, and it was divine. I am especially critical about gnocchi because 1) I hate store bought gnocchi because they are always tough and too chewy 2) home made gnocchi has a wide spectrum of variation, and I do prefer gnocchi when they are slightly on the pillowy, melt in your mouth type. For this dish, they err on being a little too soft, but I didn't mind at all, especially with a tomato crab sauce that tastes home made and fresh. For the pizza, the crust was thin and delicious, and the tomato sauce also tasted home-made. The burratini was very milky and soft, it's not as good as the one from Etna, but it's almost half the price, and I have to give points for their tomatoes. The cherry tomatoes served with the burratini was sweet and low acid, and reminded me of tomatoes in Italy. In all, I thought that the meal was almost underpriced, given the effort put into the dishes. Would go back soon. :)"

This stall is well known as it has been featured on several TV programmes related to food. I visited China Whampoa Homemade Noodles on a Saturday morning. I was surprised that there was no queue at this stall. The reason was because they customers were told to find a table nearby and come back at a certain time (e.g. half an hour later) to collect their bowl of noodles. They serve a variety of noodles such as Ban Mee and You Mian. In addition, these were available with prawns, abalone clams, sliced fish, pig's kidney or even with abalone! I ordered a bowl of Abalone Clams Hand Made You Mian $4 and had to wait for slightly less than half an hour before I could collect my order. The Abalone Clams Hand Made You Mian was delicious! It consisted of abalone clams, vegetable, minced meat and ikan bilis. The homemade noodles (you mian) was springy, soft and flavourful! It tasted slightly different from the other homemade noodles stall and seems to be accompanied by a hint of sweetness. The soup was refreshing. It was robust, sweet and not salty. One unique ingredient which was used was the mani cai 马尼菜(aka sweet leaf). This was an essential ingredient as it provides a natural sweetness to the soup. The homemade chilli paste was slightly sweet with a extremely spicy after taste. Despite the spiciness, it was just so shiok (addictive) that I continually dipped the minced meat into it or just add some to each spoonful of noodles. By the end of this meal, I nearly finished all the chilli paste and found myself with swollen lips (just like Angelina Jolie's  bee stung lips - sexy) haha..  You have been warned!

The food was excellent. It has been a while since I've had such a good meal and it really was like being in Italy. First and second courses are a selection of fish and meat dishes. Each is just a mouthful or two but fantastically prepared. The last main dish is an individually prepared pasta, we could see from the other tables that none of the dishes were exactly the same. Dessert was a small selection of tasty treats, again no more than a mouthful or two. Despite each dish being quite small we were perfectly full by the end of dinner. All of the staff were fantastic and the atmosphere is nice and cosy, I actually forgot I was in Singapore as it was so much like being in Europe!Not a cheap evening but well worth it for a special occasion; I will definitely be back!"

I had dinner at Bar-roque Grill the night before with 6 family members while tonight's dinner at Fratini was with 5 of my childhood friends. Though the French and Italians will probably snuff at anyone comparing their ""pride of my mama's table"" cooking, I will.I thought Fratini offered a way more enjoyable, bang for your buck, well paced and homely meal. Before you say well hey, isn't Bar-roque going for more of a fine dining angle? I'd say if the chef ""plumbs his roots"", serves ""large familial portions"" and his mum's apple pie is a star dessert, we're talking bout the same concept here and modern Alsace vs. Pescara cooking becomes a discussion on semantics and style for the chefs.First on the food, I liked that Fratini offered almost 10 dishes (I lost count) that had different textures (roasted, fried, grilled) and flavor combinations. My favorites were the roast pork, which was like an Italian siew yoke, braised beef cheek with black lentils - common cheap cut at a lot of restaurants these days but Fratini's was braised well enough that it *melted* in my mouth. The fried squid was a winner too but then again welding a fryer isn't a standout skill at this level. All our dishes came just as we were finishing the last and the waiter introduced each one, which was great pacing.In contrast, while the grilled octopus at Bar -roque was unique, the seafood and meat platters we ordered kinda ran into each other texture and flavor wise. The seafood pan for example comes with a delicious broth for you to spoon over the fish et al, but its essentially one flavor and a stew. The meat board had a very well grilled ribeye but again, all the meats were from the oven so it wasn't interesting. Our plates were also served with long wait times in between which was cited by all my family members as a killjoy. I mention these things because if you're gunning for a sharing plates concept, people either need to be worshiping your grill skillz (for a roast/grill platter) or be wowed by the different flavors/textures to warrant sharing their plate with 5 others in a fork battle. Otherwise I would just order my own dish to my liking.I felt Fratini was a lot less pretentious though he maintained a how do you put it...semi-fine dining level of service and presentation like Bar-roque. We saw chef Fratini and his wife almost 4x during our meal, which really made us feel taken care of and this goes for other tables too. At Bar-roque we had an Aussie waiter who explained our menu well (though with a bit of sass ""oh you need to order the duck 4 days in advance. Not to rub it in but the table next to yours has done that""), service was just proficient and unobtrusive; then  the pace dropped significantly after the starters.Lastly in terms of value, you get very well fed at Fratini for $70/head. I don't like to count change at restaurants but at Bar-roque I paid almost $100/head ex wine and we were ""full"" from alot less food because we had to wait so long between dishes. So I will definitely be returning to Fratini many times more and maybe next time, score seats inside the restaurant."

We had several plates of various appetizers and ended on an amazing pasta dish that had the right mix of seafood, sauce and pasta.  You share plates throughout but it's not like tapas style - it's that you get a couple will get two sets of whatever is served and you each have your own.  I would call the cuisine italian-fusion but much more on the italian side of things. . There were amazing italian flavors mixed in with asian flavors here and there with a great mix of seafoods. The chef comes by your table, serves, pairs wines and otherwise opens up his restaurant like it's his personal kitchen at home and invites you in to sit down, enjoy and relax.  It was expensive but everything in Singapore is.

Luckily, you don't have to go all the way to Sembawang or even Punggol (Settlement) as this outlet is located in Toa Payoh.The restaurant was really full - although it was a Wednesday evening there were a few groups waiting in front of us (though the queue moved quickly). The fact that they don't take reservations is telling about its popularity.Their Signature White Bee Hoon (what the ""white"" in the restaurant name presumably refers to) was not bad. It was a sort of bee hoon (vermicelli) where the flavours were in sauce, and the noodles themselves were comparatively plain. Chili (which strangely didn't come with it by default) was needed to elevate its flavour from normal to good - the lime it came with was not enough and the chili's added sourness was needed to contrast with its savory flavour. Furthermore, when this dish first came it wasn't so delicious - it needed to soak in its sauce for a while to absorb the flavours and improve.The Home Made Fried Beancurd wasn't tofu per se (normal tofu dishes consist of pure tofu fried with other ingredients) but rather minced tofu with some other stuff inside (I couldn't identify it as it was finely minced but it seemed to be flour and vegetables). This was pretty tasty and it was fried in a very airy batter, giving it a pleasing texture that was light and crispy outside and bouncy inside.Unfortunatelly the Sambal Kangkong was a little disappointing as it wasn't well fried like at many Chinese restaurants, without much wok flavour, though the doneness was alright. Perhaps this was because we asked for it to be fried with less chili. Yet, they had a non-spicy option for this dish (your guess about how one makes non-spicy sambal kang kong is as good as mine) so presumably they are confident about making it well without chili - much less with some. On the up side, the more subtle touch of chili meant more of the underlying flavours emerged as they were not obscured by the fire of the chili.The Hei Zhou (signature meat and seafood fritters), while they didn't have that much meat inside, were very tasty, being crispy with a nice umami flavour. Interestingly, it also had some shades of ""Western food"" hawker centre fried chicken."

The owner is great at selling you on his menu, but sadly our experience fell far short of expectations. The steak we ordered was just okay -- not bad (we loved the salt dips!), but certainly not worthy of the price tag. For ~$50 you can easily find a better steak on the island. We would rate the food at around 3 stars (4 tops).Other reviews (on other platforms) mentioned that the owner is passive aggressive and overbearing, and this is spot on. A simple question received audible sighs and eye rolls from him, along with thinly veiled rudeness. I won't go into detail, but will just say: as the owner of a restaurant, your goal should be to make your guests feel welcome and comfortable. We felt neither. The other staff were lovely, but clearly fearful of the owner, who seemed to rule (both them and his customers!) with an iron fist. Service was a firm 1 star experience. The value was also poor. Portions were not generous (especially for the price charged), and better food and value can be had in the Thomson area -- indeed just doors away -- quite easily. Our $6 dessert was microscopic (attaching a photo here with the pepper shaker for scale), and our upsized steak looked about the same size as the standard one (it was a different cut, for sure, but honestly this was a pretty mediocre rib eye). Value is also 1 star. There's great food to be had in Thomson, but this is one to miss in favor of some of the other great places nearby."

Every dish is punchy, creamy or rich in its own way - all of them veritable umami bombs. It's also a dog-friendly establishment (at the outdoor seating area).We loved every dish we ordered, so I'll just mention three outstanding ones:Muddy mushroom soup ($6.50). The soup was really thick and chock full of mushrooms. It had a full-bodied mouthfeel, unsurprising as it was prepared on a pork bone broth base. Very rich and satisfying.Caramel carnivore pasta ($16.90). Loads and loads of sweet, caramelised onions that have been reduced to a thick and flavourful sauce, served with pork marrow and meatballs. This was crazy delicious.Pesto pasta ($16.90). The pesto sauce is a signature here (you can even buy some bottles to go), so this is a must try. The pesto is strong and punchy, with a clearly discernible taste of fresh basil, garlic and quality cheese.The recipes and flavour profiles are certainly not Italian. I'm not sure how to classify the food here - some sort of fusion? It's basically dishes of the chef's favourite flavours, turned up to the max.Service can be slightly slow, but the chef and his staff are friendly and earnest. Their passion and pride can almost be tasted."

The taste is very good. It is done about average and worth a try.  The room for improvement are that it is a bit too oily and some pieces of the meat were slightly over cooked caused the texture a little dry/rough. The steak was awesome.  Very tender and juicy. Taste is also very good. The ginger wings is ok.  Taste fine and cook well. Only A bit too much ginger taste over powered all other taste. The laksa is unique.  This is a fusion between eastern and western food. Laksa serve with pasta noodles.  I really like the generous portion of the seafood serve with the noodle. Taste not bad.  I would recommend to make the dish a bit more sauce as it was a bit dry.  Also, the noodle taste good and texture is good. I would prefer it little firmer. The one thing that I found it doesn't match the place is the way they serve soft drinks. They should just pour it on a nice glass rather then serve the can. Overall this is a nice surprise find. The service is excellent and the environment feel very comfortable.   I would go back again with friends and also for biz dinner. Be warn that The location is a bit hard to get to without a car.  Even with a car, parking could be tough.   So take a taxi!"

The service is terrible because the owner is condescending and thinks very highly of himself. If you order very little or just drinks please expect to be discrimated and treated differently from the staff. They have no shame showing their hatred for thrifty and cautious people. But if you are a big spender, you will be treated as royalty. Be wary when the owner jokes with you or engages with small talk, he does not want to make your dining experience better, he just wants to make you spend more."

I'm not a big fan of pasta but this place got me really HOOKED! Seriously!What I have tried and ordered:Power chowder soup ($6.9): This one was really really good! it was delicious, hearty and I wanted more. It's kinda different from the regular thick boston chowder but it's more of like homemade chicken soup style with tid bits of beef here and there which is just really amazing. I was impressed. Chicken soup ($6.5): A super tasty light soup, tastes just like how my mom would make and just the way I like it. Carnivore pasta (about $16): Amazingly creative and tasty pasta with simmered onion with black sweet sauce & homemade pork meatballs.Mac & cheese patty ($15.9): My partner didn't really like this one because according to him it was quite sickening but guess what! I LOVE IT! Again it's not the regular american mac & cheese, I personally think that this version is much better than the original one. The patty was not that juicy but I still could taste that it was really freshly made from the oven. Really loving the homemade fusion touch at Pasta J.Red devils chick wings ($10.9): I guess this was the only menu that we didn't like. The idea of baked wings is fun and healthy but the taste just didn't make the cut.Classic créme brulee ($4.9): Dessert time! It came in a super mini version and it's really good. I just find that the caramel on top was too bitter and thick, the rest was great! They even used real vanilla beans instead of artificial vanilla as flavoring and I appreciate that so much! I could really feel that they put lots of effort, dedication and passion in bringing up the utmost flavour for all their dishes, try it, you will not regret it. It's really a hidden gem! Perfect place for a family as well. There is outdoor seating for smoking area and dog friendly! I'll be back for more soups!"

I love the casual and homely atmosphere of the restaurant. To start my meal of, I had the mushroom soup which was interestingly served in a mug. I could instantly tell it was homemade with the fine string of onions and mushroom in it, it had the perfect texture. For the main course I had the boudarian I think that's what it's called. A+ for the presentation. Although the noodle was a little soft and the sauce was quite blend . All in all it was a good experience dinning in Pasta J."
