The place was full when I tried to book online with the next available slot more than a week later. I tried calling the restaurant and managed to get a slot at 12noon with a need to return the table at 12.45pm.

If anyone remember Klee (now defunct cocktail bar that was too early for its time) at Portsdown Road, this place reminds me of it, except that it is way more than just a cocktail bar.We hiked down to Gillman Village, firstly to get a drink, plus to try out the prawn vermicelli that received a glowing review in the Straits Times. The prawn vermicelli is served as a supper menu item, from 10pm on weekdays and 10.30pm on weekends. The prawn broth is made by frying amaebi shrimps and Sakura ebi, then simmered in pork stock for 7 hours. When served, the server will reiterate that there is absolutely no sugar or seasoning added. Your bowl of yumminess is served with 4 choices of grilled shrimps (banana, giant tiger, gamba espanola, gamba carabinero) on the side. You are also given a condiment tray: sea salt, Japanese spice, chilli powder, plus get this......pork lard made from iberico jamon.All those of course comes with a price. We went with the gamba espanola, which has a large head that comes with the most amazing roe. Slurp it all up from the head and you are in gamba haven. The flesh of this shrimp is not firm like our usual shrimps, but the taste of the roe more than made up for it. One of this shrimp comes in at $15 on their ala carte menu...Other dishes we had:- diver-caught Atlantic scallops cerviche - while it was awesome, it is also much too expensive at $20 for two bite size portion. I understand that this will cost much more at a sushi restaurant, but still...- grilled baby Indian squids - so good. Done in all natural goodness without batter so you really taste the succulent juiciness and with a slight smokey crispness at the edge. I can eat this forever.- pan-fried fish. Can't remember which fish we had but it came with an awesomely crispy skin.Started off with some very fruity cocktails. All the cocktails are deliciously fruity yet strong. The kyoho grape one is full of the beautiful notes of this amazing fruit, pulp included so that you are sure this is the real deal. Strangely, the drinks are served kind of ice-blended, so you do get a brain freeze if you drink it immediately.Menu is strictly seafood. If you are allergic to seafood, or looking for meats, avoid this place. The pricing is on the high side but they pride themselves on quality seafood."

From what I had heard leading up to my trip was that it was a very clean country with excellent food. Both rang true from my experience. I found the Naked Fin on yelp by looking up restaurants around me. I love to pair my food with a good glass of wine and the images provided on their yelp page won me over immediately. Most of the restaurants here don't offer a drink list and are small pop-up shops that are outdoors and the humidity has been a bit of a change from my SoCal weather. Haha so that's why The Naked Fin stood out to me. Further more there was a video. It was a quick little blurb about the owner and how The Naked Fin got started.  It gave all the more reassurance this would be the experience I was hoping for. Once I arrived it was what I expected and more. The food cooking in the back smelt great they staff was so greeting and really helped me pick what would be best for me as I didn't understand most of the menu and terminology. The big reason I wanted to go as well was this Baby Indian Squid App that I saw in the video and on their yelp page. I have enclosed a photo. OMG! It was even better than I imagined. It tasted like crispy sesame seed oil. They cooked them just right and I was so happy I got them. The prawn soup was great as well. It pair great with the white wine (I would compare to a Pino Grigio) they went excellent together and I was very happy with the service food and over all experience here. If you're in Singapore The Naked Fin is a MUST TRY!

Small and cosy but doesn't feel cramped at all. Unpretentious with IKEA kitchenware and yet tasteful at the same time. Music's at the perfect volume and playlist is legit. Food is just delightful. Fresh and thoughtfully put together. Me and the missus had the set dinner for 2 and every dish that came with it was really tasty. The cocktails are amazing as well. Simple yet punchy. Most of all, the people there are lovely. They all looked like they really love what they do, and was informative and engaged throughout the night.

It's large so order it to share. The squid, the prawns, the fish - all the seafoods were grilled, seared and fried to perfection. The wine list wasn't over-whelming but instead offered good, simple, unpretentious choices.

The restaurant is small, so reservations are a must. You need to call them in the afternoon otherwise no one answers the phone. The lunch menu is simple and uncomplicated. We had the lobster roll with creme freche and a fish and chips. The roll was excellent with generous portions of lobster cooked well. Likewise the fish and chips though I think it was a tad overdone. The fish they use is the ling fish. Line caught and very good. Price wise is a little high, but with 3 portions of lobster what do you expect.

I'll state that upfront.I went yesterday night again..drinks with friends from work with bites...Dinner for them, half dinner for me. My rating is 4 stars overall because there are a few misses. Overall still a solid choice and the service was helpful and pleasant.Here's the rundown:Cocktails1) coconut - Yes! I finally got to try it. This was our top pick o the night. They blended the flesh in as well which gave the slushy sorbet a creamier texture. Very coconuty..but you know how some coconuts taste old. This tasted like the sweetest freshest thai coconut had been used. Friends all loved it after tasting mine.2) white peach bellini - friend had this. It was refreshing.3) melon with the hendrick's gin - this was more subtle. melon taste was there but it was definitely less sweet and had a bit of bitterness. I wasn't sure if it was from the rind of the melon but my friend thought it was the gin.4) orange guava cocktail - I had this before so I didn't try. My friend said nice but a bit too sweet. She said her first drink the bellini was better.5) mojito - we all thought this had hardly enough sugar or none in it. My friend asked for sugar syrup to add up. Because of the addition of the orion beer, this was quite a light tasting cocktail. I wouldn't order it again.6) kalamansi - I wanted something sour and this was indeed sour. In fact my friends all made faces when they tried and said it was too much. While I did enjoy it..towards the end I found it too much and I actually left some in the glass. Only if you REALLY like sour. On hindsight I wish I had ordered 2 coconuts hahaFood:1) baby squids - YUMS! Simply grilled, juicy..lots of flavour.2) clams in white wine - needed more white wine. My friends said it was very ""healthy"" and I should have more as I was under the weather.3) cold bee hoon - lightly seasoned, not greasy with a tang of lemon. really nice complement to the food..or just eat it on its own..or drizzle it with the above said clam broth to elevate the clam broth (haha rather than the other way round)4) northern prawns - predominant impression was salty. Gavin did explain they overcook these a bit so the shells can be eaten. I saw another lady eating the big prawns and those looked really juicy which was more the kind of prawns I was expecting.5) razor clams - $12 a piece but surprisingly meaty. fresh and yummy. although they drizzled with shallot oil, it didn't taste oily.Staff were rather busy but responsive. It's a tiny place so it's hard to do a big group unless you book early."

We (over)ordered an extra fish that the restaurant  was not recommending and it took the edge off an otherwise good meal.Other than that, YES, do visit, keep the ordering sane, have a cocktail or a nice craft beer and enjoy the evening and the peaceful surroundings.

Its greenhouse aesthetic is maintained, so you get an expansive view of the lush surrounds of Gillman Barracks. It's a terrific escape from the hustle and bustle of city living. Be sure to make reservations though, it was a busy full house on a Friday afternoon when we popped by for lunch.Very little is done to the seafood, which is fresh and sweet. If you thought that read bland food, you'd be mightily mistaken. The food here is hearty and soulful, and robust with flavour. It's just that when the ingredient's that fresh and sweet, very little needs to be done to it.We had:1) Grilled Indian Baby Squid ($8) - seasoned simply with a flick of sea salt and slick of olive oil: must try. Soft, sweet and succulent2) Beef Burger ($23): At first blush, it looked disappointingly minuscule. But (some, not all) good things come in small packages, and this turned out an indulgent, finger-licking-good powerhouse. The decadent grass-fed dry-aged Japanese wagyu patty, dripping with juices, came together with the Boston lettuce, American cheese, and special sauce brilliantly. Just be sure to get double (or triple) orders of this if you're hungry.3) Pan-fried Barramundi Fillet ($20): paper-crisp skin and moist flaky meat. This was seasoned with olive oil and finished with sea salt, accompanied by a mound of blanched kangkong tossed in kalamansi juice, dried shrimp, and shallot oil, and vermicelli oiled in sesame and fried garlic bits, both served refreshingly chilled4) Hae Mee Tng ($25): a medley of farmed giant tiger prawns, Salmon Creek Farms pork belly, in a blended soup of 9 prawn species and simmered pork bones. This was rich and sweet but not cloying, as The Naked Finn resists the addition of MSG or sugar. Get the vermicelli for a traditional option, or the Japanese somen for a twist on the classic. 5) Homemade Naked Chendol ($13) with coconut sorbet: deconstructed version of a local classic, but refreshingly lovely6) Homemade Gula Melaka Sorbet with Sea Salt ($10): a twist on the flavour du jour, salted caramel. An absolute must-try.7) Homemade Sour Plum Sorbet ($10) with osmanthus jelly: recommended if you prefer a tangy refreshing end to your meal"

It was easy to make a phone reservation just a day before, but do call earlier if you have firmed up plans, to ensure air-con availability.  1.  Salted Egg Crab $70/kg *highly recommended*Crabs seem to command better prices that rare minerals like gold or diamonds! It was just 2 years ago when 1kg of crabs cost $50, but nevertheless, these Indian crabs are fleshy. The salted egg sauce was so good, you know it's real salted egg and not the powered artificial salted egg, due to the graininess of the sauce. Not to mention, the taste. Sadly, KEK does no serve fried mantous, only the steamed mantous at $1 per piece. In the background of this photo, you can see 2 mantous, they're pretty big but I would still prefer to dip fried mantous into the sauce. The crab tasted reasonably fresh, but I felt that the chef had fried the crab for too long, resulting in the meat being stuck to parts of the shell.2. Ming Zhu Roll *highly recommended*This mingzhu roll is definitely a worthy cause to visit KEK. With salted egg right in the middle, this is so pretty and yet delicious. This dish came straight to our table within 2 minutes of ordering. I was confused if this order belonged to another table, but the staff insisted it was for us. The batter is light and crispy. The mushrooms were juicy and added alot of flavour.3. Fried Hor Fun $5/$8 *highly recommended*Probably their number 1 seller is their fried hor fun. Served with a raw egg. This dish is one of a kind, the wok hei can be subtly picked up by you sense of smell, but the taste of the wok hei is so vivid to your tastebud! The egg helps to make the hor fun wet, and when we ordered both a $5 and a $8 portion, we felt that they gave the same amount of ingredients, with 1 egg in each dish. Maybe they gave us more noodles, but we couldn't see the difference.There's prawns, lup cheong (chinese sausage), squids and some slices of fish mixed into the delicious and fragrant fried hor fun. I definitely want to come back to KEK seafood for this!4. Fried Prawn Paste ChickenA family favourite that we usually order at every zi char, tasted rather ordinary here at KEK. The pieces were quite small and wasn't quite what we expected since the other dishes had set our expectations much higher. Skip this and also skip the hot plate tofu, it was bland and a waste of $10.5. Coffee Pork Ribs *highly recommended*The coffee pork ribs were so addictive. The meat was boneless and tender. The coffee sauce wasn't too sweet or over powering. The meat had a tad sweetness and chewiness in every bite. The coffee sauce was the bomb!Overall : A great place for a family meal. It cost us $180 including drinks for 7 adults."

However, one of my friends had told me KEK was one of his favourite ""go to"" tze char so I made a point to revisit. This time around, with my family to celebrate a birthday.  Alas, 3 days before the actual event, we couldn't book the aircon rooms. But luckily for us, it was a cool night and it was fine sitting outdoors.We ordered  quite a bit of their popular dishes - chili crab with mantou, salted egg yolk crab, 3-egg spinach, prawn paste chicken, mixed platter of fried appetizers, coffee ribs, moonlight horfun.  Most impressive was the moon light hor fun HANDS DOWN.  $8 for a medium portion gave us a large plate enough for 6 full bowls or 7 slightly less-full bowls.  The horfun was full of wok hei, full of lardy flavouring agents like lard cubes, lap cheong and seafood (fish slices, prawns and squid rings).  Was very very satisfying and luckily we didn't have extras for I would have walloped them all (bad for waistline!).The rest of the food was good but nothing extraordinary.  The biggest let down was the famed salted egg yolk crab. The sauce was paltry, but most importantly, the crab was overcooked and the meat stuck onto the crab :(  The chili crab fared better. While not particularly impressive, the sauce was eggy and morish enough to down a couple of pillow soft flower twist mantou  (these deserves a highlight - they were so soft!). Note there is no fried mantous here.  All these dishes for merely $207 with change!  We even had leftovers to pack up."

We had the Ito-wagyu (small), the wagyu tongue, and a long karubi beef plate, together w a horenso salad.the wagyu was good value, because having stayed in Singapore for quite a while now, I realise that most restaurants serve aussie wagyu, which for me falls short compared to its Japanese counterpart. We had a good jap wagyu fix before but prices were quite steep.... this time through some Japanese friends' recommendations, we went to try it here. I must say that the wagyu is definitely the best I have tasted so far, and much better value! because the beef was of high quality, we requested for just salt to eat w it instead for their sweet dip. (a plus was, the Himalayan salt, so this restaurant bothers w the details after all!) it was just perfect! reminded me of the jap bbq we had in Sapporo! only we downed it with ASAHI Super Dry Draft Beer this time! I would say, that had also made its mark for me!it was the first time I tried beef tongue, and because hubby is a wagyu fan, he insisted on the wagyu tongue....the staff gave us a dipping bowl of lemon juice for the tongue...I dunno why...but it sure worked the best (I tried combinations w salt and sauce too) so I think, beef tongue is added to my 'favourite food list'Finally we had the karubi, cause we thought if ever we come to this restaurant, we can't be eating wagyu all the time right?! bringing my three kids would surely make my wallet 'super dry'! (they are all beef fans) so the staff suggested we try the long karubi.it was fantastic, the marbling was even and it cooked almost like the wagyu, very tender to the bite! it may even taste like wagyu for the non-seasoned diner.overall, its the best beef fix I had in sgp. I was recommended to go to the anchor point branch by a jap friend because of its homely feel, and the staff were very friendly....when I chatted w two of them, they said they have been around for years...(where do u go these days finding ppl who stay so long in one joint?!)I would definitely come back w my brood! ......maybe we need 5 plates of long karubi!!!"

If you feel that enjoying your European meals from air-conditioned Restaurants or Malls is too mainstream, try visiting here for a different experience, also skipping the additional service charges.The Swiss Farmer Platter is good for sharing for about 2 - 4 pax and consists of the Bavarian / Germans Staples like whole crispy pork knuckled, 2 selected German sausages, Achar, mashed potatoes, harsh browns and darkbeer sauce for pairing. From the look at it, the Asian Cuisine had somehow influenced the ""supposed-to-be"" German platter as the sauerkraut that I'm looking forward to has been exchanged for our Asian Achar. Portion are large and definitely economical as compared to the usual ones.Schweizer Bauern Platte (Swiss Farmer Platter) - $40.66The scene-stealer was perhaps none other than that salivating big pork knuckle that were cut into pieces. Meat was moist and fare better than the chain German Bistro that I had visited. Meat was marvelously tender and best to go with the given sauce.The Bavarian Pork Sausage was perfectly served in its plump texture and lend a good savoury bite with its juice bursting as we sank our teeth into them.Though those shredded potatoes that make up the Rosti may not be as fine as what we had from Marche, it was more fragrant and not very oily. Together with the platter, we topped up this at $5.50 only.Rosti - $5.50Having good memories from Hofbräuhaus München in Germany, I had the Hofbräu original. This is brewed by the brewery in Germany and the acquired taste was refreshingly light to go with some good german food! While for my guy friend, he prefers something stronger in flavour and went for the darker beer.Original Weiss Beer - $11 (1 Pint)Paulaner Dunkel - $11 (1 Pint)Stew Küche may not replace the restaurant environment and have limited seating but you can still call in for reservation. Overall, with menu being extensive, I find that its a good alternative if you are looking for more German Food options in Singapore."

The meats were ok, I guess for the price, it is fair. Next came the salad which was lettuce based with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and onions. And then the wait began, we finished those 2 dishes in about 20 minutes. We kind of have to check on our order 3 times and about 1 hour 15 mins later, our pork knuckle order with sausages came. While the pork knuckle was hot, just cooked, the  sausages, hashbrown and potato mash was cold. Which means they prepared everything way before the pork knuckle and served it cold. The pork knuckle was cooked a little too long, the meat was very dry and the skin was hard rather than crispy. I must say that it was a very disappointing wait when this is the final result of it.Well, I'll probably give them one try again (Hofbräuhaus bier being the main reason) and hopefully the pork knuckle experience will be better and they didn't run out of the bier."

Instead of eating the side dishes on its own, I mixed everything inside (besides the sweet sauced over the potatoes) my hotstone bibimbap. The portion was quite generous and I think price wise it was pretty decent. I like the combination of spicy pork bulgogi into my hot stone bibimbap. Overall, it was one decent meal.

We went there to celebrate mother's day dinner and the place was huge. The titles were lined with black & white checked squares, reminding me of Alice In Wonderland. The walls were laced with old photos of Singapore back in the 50-60s? A private collection of the owner's. The place wasn't crowded on the evening we came. Our servers wrote white gloves as they place the cutlery and dishes on our table after each course. Our french server, I think he was the manager, took care of our table. He had a good sense of humor and made my parents laugh which was great! Dad can be picky about his food (especially when someone else, aka me, decides to try a new place for the first time). 1. Seared Foie Gras (with orange & cointreau) - Beautifully done! even though I am not a fan of Foie Gras, I took a little bit out of this one and it was perfectly pan-fried. Slightly crispy on the outside while retaining all of its juices & flavor on the inside. 2. Lobster bisque - Good. I even found a piece of lobster tail in my portion. Yums! 3. Seared scallop, lobster tail & Cod tortellini with mussel sauce - Ok. I didn't care much for the Cod tortellini which tasted a tad bit fishy. I liked the green pea paste and lobster tail. Excellent presentation.4. Seared Wagyu beef fillet with roasted duck breast - Some slices of the Wagyu beef were slightly too undercook for my liking. I prefer my meat medium to well, but I could see why they would not risk cooking it for awhile longer. The slices were too thin and too much heat could have easily spoilt the beef. The duck was excellent. None of those strong smell that sometimes accompanies duck meat. I love the black vinegar-like sauce that was drizzled over the meat. I only wished they gave more. 5. Lemon Tart with raspberry sauce and Crème fraîche?  - Good. The top of the lemon tart was slightly caramelized like the top of a creme brûlée. The Crème fraîche was a little on the sour side but nonetheless was a good compliment to the sweetness of the tart. 6. Dark chocolate - Good. Powdered on the outside. Think Royce's chocolates :) 7. Camomile Tea - I didn't dare risk a sleepless night on a caffeinated drink. A pleasant, warm, soothing finish to an excellent meal! PS: they have little napkins folded like shirts. adorable!"

I am not a picky person by nature but having lived and traveled a bit, I have often found it frustrating to find restaurants in Singapore that deliver good food AND good service with prices that leave you enough change for the cab right home.  And don't even get me started on service standards. So it was to our family's delight (we were a party of six mind you), that Masons met all those check boxes.Masons serves modern European cuisine in a former British barrack. The interiors have been done up in a modern Colonial fashion, with white and black tiles, teak tables, glass front windows and pictures of Singapore back in the day. A testament to the owner's attention to detail are the fashionable white show and side plates monogrammed with the restaurant's name, and white napkins folded into the shape of  a shirt with a thyme ""tie"". The menu itself has some classic dishes like dishes like Roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, Coq au vin and Duck confit, but also innovative ones like roast pork cheeks with pear and sweet potatoes. For starters, my family ordered the gamut from lobster bisque and mussels to the fried brie. I liked the lobster bisque as it was flavorful (doused with cognac I think) but not too heavy. The fried brie was incredibly delicious - sweet, crunchy on the outside with a nutty overtone. Oh and the freshly baked bread rolls dolled out were all gone in minutes.For mains, 4 out of 6 of us ordered Pork cheeks, which is really pork neck to the Cantonese and Spaniards. It was pan fried and topped with pear and some tart emulsion, along with local vegetables and sweet potato. This should be the restaurant's star dish. Pork cheek itself is usually quite fatty (which is why it makes a killer char siew) but the cut served was surprisingly lean, very moist and fell gently apart when cut. The fruit-based accompaniments went very well with the pork and who can complain about sweet potatoes? My sister had a grilled cod that was also very well done while my man had the duck confit. The duck was done pretty well and soft, but not as crispy on outside as he would have liked. We paired this meal with some Napa Valley Cab Sav, which was full bodied enough to handle the flavors on the table. For dessert, we had the crepe Suzette, dark chocolate mousse and chocolate fondant. All of which did more than an excellent job of finishing our meal. The same can be said of the service led by a French lady who I'm guessing was the maitre d. She explained the menu and what was available, made sure our glasses were always full and checked on our meal throughout the evening. The other waitstaff were also trained to serve our dishes without disrupting our conversation but careful to announce what they were serving. I wish I could commend this level of service more but it is TRULY appreciated and lacking these days.So if you'd like a chic and enjoyable evening with good European food, I'd suggest checking out Masons. It is so much better than many of the over hyped, chi chi wannabe restaurants around town and it is about time we got some sensibility in the dining scene. Bravo."

They pride themselves with made from scratch burgers with juicy and calorie overdose burgers and milkshakes! They have a wide variety of burgers, with beef, fish, chicken and even pork for non-beef eaters!I love their presentation of the menu which gives you a breakdown of their innovative and delicious burgers. Burgers are no longer just a round slab of meat sandwiched between two buns. Here at Jack Ripper, they even create their own sauces such as maple syrup and dijon mustard to become maple mustard. Pretty ingenius in my opinion!One thing to note about all the 3 burgers is that their brioche buns were amazing! All of them had aa stronger crisp and stayed crispy throughout my prolonged photo-taking session and they were also fluffy on the inside. The buns itself had flavour and taste.1. SoCal Guacamole $18All natural beef, cheddar, creamy-rich guacomole, jalapeno, tomato, avocao and alfafa sprouts. The creamy guacamole is what made me like this burger! The beef patty was the same as the ripper's classic so check below!2. Ripper's Classic $16All natural beef, Jack's sauce, Cheddar cheese, romaine lettuce, tomato and onion. The cheese here was oozing with all it's glory and it did not disappoint. The beef patty was juicy but didn't actually have a strong taste. I felt that it was a little too bland for my liking. The pork patty in the swine and roses faired much better. But at least, the beef patty was soft and tender, showcasing the quality of beef used as well as their effort in preparation!3. Swine & Roses $18 *MUST TRY!*Pork stuffed with safe and apple, cheddar cheese, maple mustard, lettuce and deep fried onions. I used to think that the only pork burger I would ever like are pulled pork burgers, if it has a patty, it should be a beef patty. But this burger changed me completely! The pork patty was so juicy and flavourful. It was oozing was pork juices everytime I tried to bite into it! The apple slices were amazingly sweet and yet crunchy. The thickness of the apples slices were perfect! The maple mustard sauce also gave this savoury burger a slight sweetness to it! I really really really enjoyed this burger!4. Dark Chocolate Milkshake $8.50I love my sinful milkshakes and I love them even more when they're super thick and creamy that you can barely drink it up with a straw. I watched the staff scoop ice cream, scoop after scoop and toss them into a blender and TA-DA! You have your $8.50 milkshake. I must admit, the prices are high for their drinks but you would probably want to share a milkshake with a friend.5. Matcha Milkshake *MUST TRY!*As a matcha lover, I was over the top when I heard that they had a matcha milkshake that wasn't listed on their menu. I guess they're expanding their milkshake offerings? The green tea flavour in here was evident but the sweetness of the ice cream was stronger! Making this a very sweet matcha milkshake which was PERFECT for my sweet tooth!~6. Cookies n cream milkshakeServed with cookie crumbs on the top is this cookies and cream milkshake. By the time this milkshake arrived. I was so full from all the food, my tummy was exploding but I couldn't give up this cookies and cream milkshake. The creamy texture was on point and there was a good balance of cookies to ice cream in this milkshake too!I am not a carb lover so I didn't really enjoy the fries, but they were very generous with it!Jack Ripper also carries imported beers!Overall : Jack the Ripper has the right ideas for the ingredient combinations that redefines the enjoyment value of burgers."

Instead, I ended up trying the Swine & Roses, which is a pork burger. It costs $18, but they allowed me to have it at the Classic's price of $16 since they ran out of beef. I appreciate the gesture!The burger came with fries (THANK YOU for not being one of those establishments that charge extra for fries!) and I loved how they used brioche buns. I also liked how it was topped with sliced apple; it was a nice touch.I really liked their fries, too.

The pho with beef slices had a nice flavour, and despite having a less crowded flavour profile it didn't lose out in terms of taste. Indeed the simplicity has something to recommend it.Bun cha (vermicelli with pork) is a dish that is not easy to find in Singapore. The dish here came with tastily grilled pork slices and pork balls in a broth that was well balanced, tasty and not too sour.Grilled beef in bamboo with rice was an interesting dish. It had a tasty wok flavour and was fried with interesting condiments, so it tasted special - not your usual wok fried beef.The lemongrass Skewers with noodles were only so so. I felt the skewers didn't use very good quality meat (being formed from minced meat) and could've been tastier.The fried spring rolls were nice. Though not as crispy as I've had at some places, they were meaty. Indeed they were better than most I've tried in Vietnam (which are mostly vermicelli, to save costs). The Westlake prawn cakes were a bit cakey (I was expecting something with a lighter crumb) but still tasted alright. The menu said they came in servings of 4 - mine came with 3 but they were huge.The drinks lime soda chanh and sour plum soda were not very sweet, which should please those who like their drinks less sweet. The former being rarer than the latter (at least in Singapore) was more interesting.Stay away from the ice cream here though. I had Vanilla Nutella and there were small but noticeable ice crystals. Furthermore the ice cream was not creamy and indeed was slightly brittle. Meanwhile the vanilla did not have a prominent taste at all, and I mainly tasted sugar. Meanwhile the Nutella was drizzled on top and was not integrated into the ice cream. It was so bad I didn't finish it though it wasn't a big portion."

The interior is minimalistic and surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows that expose one to a breathtaking view of the surrounding greenery. Al fresco dining is also available, but I guess they only open up that area around dinner time. The food took a while to arrive, but it was worth the wait. First up was the Orange Miso Cod Mignon ($29++). The capellini was al dente, broth had a pleasantly sweet kick and the cod itself was marinated and cooked just right. Next to arrive: Cap of Ribeye ($36++). Requested for medium doneness, but inconsistency was apparent as some areas (especially the sides) were tough while others (some patches within the core) were red, wet, and insufficiently cooked. Taste-wise, the meat was undeniably well-marinated with smoky undertones that thankfully didn't overwhelm the main flavor. Following that: Farmed Poulet ($30++). This was by far the worst dish. The breast meat was dry and the poultry jus made me cringe. Furthermore, the accompanying 2 undercooked slivers of carrot cannot be labeled as anything other than sad. Finally, the last dish: Oven-baked Sea Bass ($29++). The piece of fish was noticeably small in relation to the other dishes, but the succulent meat topped with creamy sauce more than made up for it. Portion size was a little on the small side especially for the fish-based dishes and all the mains were a tad too salty. Strangely, despite it being an ordinary Tuesday afternoon, 4 dishes were unavailable: the Iberian pork, beef cheek, rack of lamb and prime rib. A little disappointing since I turned up for the Iberian pork. But I'll definitely patronize this establishment once more; not so much for the food, but for the serenity and intimate atmosphere offered by this hidden gem."

Ambience in the restaurant was good, casual and cosy. Food was delicious, right portion for 2 to share. It's reasonable priced in my opinion. Good place to spent Friday night catching up w friend & dating."

Also, the ambience is pleasantly rustic and cosy. Being nestled in nature at hortpark, dinner there proved to be quite romantic. The deco of the restaurant was simple yet elegant. The surrounding area made us feel like we're not in Singapore. Menu is limited for both food and beverages. The food took quite awhile to arrive, but it was quite delicious when it did. We had double boiled chicken consommé with spinach ricotta tortellini ($10) as appetizer, the soup was not impressive to me but I loved the tortellini. Ordered caesar salad ($16) too but really disappointed at it, the smoked chicken was really dry, had pungent smell and the dressing was so terrible. Both main courses we ordered; orange miso cod mignon with collagen broth ($34) and honey roasted spatchcock ($30) were especially stellar.The only letdown was that I found the cod way too small and a bit cold when served but still good, it's so good that I wish it's a little bigger, then my tummy would be happier. The honey roasted spatchcock was amazingly moist, awesome glazing with marination infused into the meat perfectly. I had Vineyard Signature ($16) as my cocktail that night, tasted pretty unique and new to me, was worth ordering. However, I couldn't taste the alcohol at first and then one of the waiters admitted that they usually would give lower amount of alcohol initially but free of charge if customers desire a stronger drink (like me, duh).In conclusion, it's a good place away from the city, definitely an excellent venue and will leave you a pleasant experience but if food has always been your main focus above all else, I don't think you'd enjoy visiting this place. I'd probably go back for the drinks."

The food was terrible - the bull frog leg took 30 minutes to come and then, a miserable amount and a miserable size. The food we came for was not available - beef, duck etc. We ordered the Kids Burger expecting a decent sized one but we got two minute pieces of dry bread, cheese, tomato and beef forced together with a toothpick holding it all together. Not to mention when we first entered the waiters took about 15 minutes to finally hand us the menu... We asked for some water but took over 5 minutes for the request to be sent through, through the second waiter (the first one never sent through our request). We asked for some bowls to share the soup but everyone completely ignored us, had to take the bowls ourselves. Waiter took my soup spoon despite a bowl of soup right in front of me. At the end of the meal, the waitress bumped into me but never apologized... Overall, I think that the standard of service can be improved."

Only the braised short ribs were OK, but then they obviously have kitchen issues as the sandwich came cold, probably from sitting on the counter too long, waiting for the truffle fries to be ready. Service also nothing much to comment about, mostly non existent. They've got a nice ambience in a secluded location that is not over run by people. That's the only major plus point."

The best part is that they are not stingy on the ingredients at all! For prawn dumplings, there are literally three fresh and nicely steamed prawn inside! Even for siew mai there's a small prawn in! Same goes for cheong fun, giving you a mouthful of delight.My favorites: Siew mai: fresh and soft with a prawn at the bottom. Not so heavy seasoned so you can enjoy the full body of a siew mai without feeling thirsty afterwardsBlack bean pork rib: the portion is huge with quite some small ribs which come with few bones! The best part is instead of using yam, pumpkin was put in at the bottom which give the ribs a special aroma. The less dry pumpkin also makes the rib a bit more moist, allowing the full contact with your taste buds, hence maximizing the impact of the taste.Price: $2.5 dollars for every single dim sum if you check the bill before 11am! Such value for money! Area for improvement: Some of the dim sum could be more seasoned. The skin of prawn dumplings is a little too thick. Overall great dim sum with great friends as company! Highly recommend!"

It's worth the walking and trudging under the sun to get to the location. But of course if someone's driving then it's ideal.We had a department 'gathering' and my boss recommended this place. It's his favourite dim sum location.  The restaurant is separated into two areas, one air-conditioned, one without. They each provide different experiences: the air-con one for the big family gatherings and 'more formal' dinners; the non air-con for the authentic Cantonese kopitiam-styled dim sum.The service staff were probably more attentive in the air-con restaurant, much like what you'd expect in a typical Chinese restaurant in the shopping mall.The dishes were listed in a paper menu that you can tick and select the ones you'd want. The dim sum were mostly hits - the har gow, the siew mais, the chee cheong fun, they were all delicious. Don't forget to grab a few egg tarts, they run out of stock easily so you might want to make the order early."

Zi Yean is the place to go with your whole village of relatives if you are not there sourcing for the best, but just plain comfort dim sum. Nothing fanciful, your usual siew mais and har kaos, but one thing to rave is the mei cai kou rou bun ( stewed preserved vegetables with pork). It is just the right balance of sweet and salty, with a fragrant garlic aroma when eaten hot. It is a simple bun, but it does make you want more. The siew mai uses finely diced lean meat rather than minced meat, giving it the textural bite and freshness often lacking in siew mais. For two person having a decent dim sum breakfast of 6 steamer trays, you would expect to pay about $25."
