Half the restaurant was filled that night. We decided to try the a la carte buffet which included lobsters and some other premium items. I was not sure if it was because we had the buffet or what, but the dishes were not as good as usual.The sea cucumber dish was a disappointment. It looked and tasted strange. Not sure if this was the cause of stomach upset/diarrhea for the 3 of us who tried it. The others did not eat this. In any case, just do not order this dish in the buffet. Service was excellent though. I think it would be better to just order from the regular menu in future."

So to sum it up, the brunch menu at Peony Jade had me going back for another bite...but not in a good way.  Each bite left me hanging a little, just shy of pleasingly sated. Great meals are less about more and almost always  about balance, which in Peony Jade's case was poignantly missing from the brunch menu."

Naturally, given Singaporeans' favourite past time of arguing about food, there has been a lot of controversy of this. So I thought it would be a good time to leave a review for this place (especially given that there's only 2 others, one each in 2015 and 2016 - I might as well fulfill the quota for 2016), which celebrates its 12th anniversary in the Keppel Club this year.In short, the award was deserved as most of the dishes are good or excellent, and the prices are quite reasonable (even before the credit card discount). Furthermore, this place doesn't just serve traditional Chinese food, but has subtle spins on it that adapt it to a modern sensibility. For example, there are animal shaped buns to appeal to the kids, and there are some Western ingredients and techniques (and no, not the usual foie gras that so many places rely on).The Rose-Infused Honey Glazed BBQ Pork was wonderful. Most char siew (BBQ Pork) is made with meat that is rather lean, leaving it rather dry and gaining more flavour from its sauce than its inherent characteristics. The BBQ pork here had lots of fat and so was really tender and succulent. The fragrant sauce worked in harmony with the meat rather than being the main deliverer of flavour to the dish. I didn't taste the rose, but I was still really happy with this.We also had Szechuan Style Tea Smoked Duck. This was pretty good, being crispy with a subtle tea taste. It was served with a hoisin-like sauce that was probably fermented bean sauce, as well as steamed buns. Not the usual serving method but some might appreciate the different take on the dish.The beef tenderloin cubes with scallions and premium sauce was possibly the best dish of all. The cut was pretty good, and could pass for good wagyu, with delicious fat and marbling. The sauce was fragrant and robust and the wok hei (kiss of the wok) was really great.The pork tenderloin with XO sauce and snow peas was not bad. The meat was tender and bouncy and the snow peas were remarkably clean-tasting (either due to freshness, not being over-fried or both).The stewed wintermelon with crabmeat and roe was alright. Nothing special, but a bit pricey due to the crab. So it is best avoided.The dry beef hor fun was very fragrant. The beef was tender and had bite, even though it was not primarily a beef dish. The noodles also had wok hei.We also had crispy youtiao roulette with king prawns. This dish is so awesome that I've ordered it on all 3 of my visits this year. The name is a bit of a misnomer because the very generous, fresh and flavourful prawn interior is surrounded by fried beancurd skin rather than youtiao (dough fritter). It is then wrapped with chee cheong fun (on the thick side) and served with a light soya sauce based sauce (the sort you usually find with dim sum chee cheong fun, not the breakfast vegetarian chee cheong fun thick sweet black sauce).On 2 previous visits we had sweet and sour sticky pork ribs. The sauce was better than that of the usual Emperor/King Pork Ribs - it was based on that standard flavour, but taken further and elaborated. Furthermore, they were sticky ribs - inspired by US-style ribs (instead of being wetter like Chinese style Emperor/King Pork Ribs are).We also had deep fried cod pieces in an edible basket tossed with dried chilis. This wasn't too bad - reasonably crispy and fresh. The chilis' flavour didn't really come through, which wasn't necessarily bad as our pre-schooler could eat the bits not buried in the dried chilis.The siu mai and soya sauce chicken were normal. On the other hand, the shredded duck salad (something you wouldn't find at virtually all other Chinese restaurants) was a bit uninspired. It didn't have much duck, and the salad dressing was boring. So no not everything here is very good, or even good."

Rainbow cake $5.80The was moist, the layers were of even thickness and most of all! The butter cream on the top wasn't sweet. It was perfect. I loved it! I would totally get this again for sure!  I like that it is a petite size, so it's not too huge that you have to share it and also makes the price cheaper as well :D2. Berries Waffle $13.90The waffles came with cotton candy perched on a plastic stick that was ""planted"" into a cup of green tea powder on top of a cup of chocolate mousse. The waffles were very crispy and I loved it! They were generous with the fruits and I am won over by their crispy waffles.I also like that they have free wifi! The staff were friendly, but the shop is really cramped, and the tables are very close to each other. Nonetheless, if you are within the area, do check this out :D"

So it must be luck and fate that I chanced upon its pop-up stall at Orchard Central. The signature rainbow cake dutifully lived up to its reputation and exemplified all the essential qualities of a good sponge; moist and fluffy. There is even a tinge of citrus embedded in the layers. However, the cream was frosted unevenly and in short supply compared to the previous photos of rainbow cakes churned out from the same kitchen. The Chocolate Rainbow  ($5.50) turned out to be the better executed of the two as the ganache was velvety and the bottom sponge layers did not suffer from the ill fate of dehydration like the Rainbow Cake did. Most of the cakes assumed the same style and formula; squarish sponge cakes layered with cream. There isn't much excitement until I had the Matcha and Caramel Delight ($5.50 each), whose core is injected with red bean paste and salted caramel sauce respectively.Alas, something unpredicted amidst the predictabilities. In fact, both cakes surpassed the excellency of the predecessors with their unmistakable saturated sponge and little mounds of smoky piped cream. Nonetheless, these cakes were extremely delicate and I counted my blessings that little damage was inflicted by the heat when I transported them home. However, it was only until the Praline Delight ($6) when I started to see potential of this pastry shop. Chocolate mousse, hazelnut paste +crunch, sponge cake coated in chocolate ganache and nuts. It might not be the most original idea, but it's a classic combination done well. Simply look at how beautiful each layer has come together! This cake should deserve more credit and raving reviews than the mundane sponge cakes."

Simply loves its braised vegetables coupled with dried ingredients in bean sauce.Nyonya Chap Chye - $10The last to be served will be their red snapper fish head cooked in Nyonya Curry. Curry gravy was very appetizing indeed and makes a perfect pairing to the white rice. Assorted vegetables like egg plant, lady's finger and tomato among the items in the curry. Fish head was relatively fresh and was pleasing to the tastebuds.Nyonya Curry Fish Head - $28There can never be short of the taste of Gula Melaka here in their Chendol. Our desserts were shared among 5 of us and it was not a bad idea too. With freshly squeeze coconut milk over shaved ice with chendol strips and kidney beans, its all what you can find all in a bowl of chendol.Chendol - $5Buboh Cha Cha can be served either hot or cold, depending on your liking. The best thing is that freshly squeezed coconut milk was used and was good with yams, sweetpotatpes cubes that was steamed to its softened form, not forgettging my favourite tapioca jujubes!Buboh Cha Cha - $5Desserts for Durians lovers! Serve in a plate of 4. These choux pastry was filled with delicious D24 durian mousse. Taste was good but if they can come in chilled form, it would be perfect.Durian Puffs - $6Knowing that Peranakan dishes are never too easy to prepare and requires alot of perparation, they were always priced at a dearer side, that includes dining in PeraMakan. However, I find that the cuisine serve here is rather authentic and was not too commercialized like other places. However for parking, it may cost a bomb and you might want to take note."

During the 16th and 17th century, Chinese young men went to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to find their fortune. They intermarried with non-Muslim women, birthing the Peranakan culture which has its own unique cuisine. One the of most unique ingredients they use in this food is the buah keluak or Pangium Edule seed. It is actually a poisonous seed that needs to be buried after harvesting to leach the toxins. However, the delicious, nutty, slightly bitter savory and soft flesh inside when cooked in a rich gravy is amazing. Chili Padi does a nice job picking, choosing good sized seeds that are not to old.The Ngoh Hiang or mined pork wrapped and deep fried in tofu skin also has a nice texture and is served with a slightly sweet sauce. Order the Bakwang Kepiting, a soup with meatballs. The broth is delicate and the meatballs, pretty good. I enjoyed eating it with their mild sambal belacan, chili sauce made with fermented shrimp and red chilies. Yum!The Chap Chye, braised mixed vegetables and Egg Foo Yong were okay, but not memorable.Desserts we tried included the Chendol and the Sago Pudding. Both were okay. If you have a sweet tooth, ask for extra Gula Melaka or palm sugar in syrup form.I enjoyed my experience at Chili Padi."

For the basic salad you can choose one protein, one complex carb and 3 additions (unfortunately extra charge for avocado) but they are pretty generous with their portions. The few knocks against them is that their protein is really inconsistent. One day the steak is perfect and the next it can be rare cooked with a lot of fat. I have found that the less crowded they are, and the further away you are from their opening hour (11) the more likely you are to get quality. Otherwise this place is healthy and fills me up unlike most salad lunch places!"

Order extra bowls of porridge upfront rather than deal with queuing up again.4) That's the con, sometimes you come at 8pm and some popular items are sold out. Maybe we were in between batches since this place serves till early morning. It's apparently a fave haunt of taxi drivers and also my durian guy...who told me about it.5) Help yourself to chilli at the side, there's a giant bowl of it.6) After you order, your dishes are placed on a big metal tray on a side table. You pay and self-collect.7) It seems to have gotten more expensive recently but compare it with Joo Hin which is probably more expensive, I prefer here as it's a bit lighter all round which is the point of porridge for me.One pet peeve, the tables here aren't very cleaned up after the previous customer goes."

GET THIS: $12.80!!! We ordered quite similar dishes, and had beancurd skin and pork belly instead of duck, but how did we end up paying only $12.80? I'll never know.The set up is super efficient - one dude goes up the line asking for your rice/porridge orders, and sets the tray in front of the the guy who dishes out the... dishes. Now this guy is a robot. You point, and he plates. And plates. And plates. Until you stop pointing. Then another guy tallies your bill, and walks you to the cashier, who tells you whatever number the other guys tells him. You pay. And you sit and eat.Great system, good food, AMAZING prices.

We placed our orders and were told that the pork collar udon wasn't available and in its place was a prawn pasta. The starter, an onsen tamago arrived swiftly. Subsequently the mains arrived too. I paid $5 to change my mains to the yaniniku beef with caramelised pumpkin rice cake. The beef was fine, but I have an issue with the rice cake. Are ""caramelised"" and ""cake"" synonyms for tough and overcooked shaped rice? Was the rice overnight and not heated up fully? I had a tummy ache after the meal for 2 days. I hope it wasn't due to the ""rice cake"".After we paid and left, I looked through the receipt while trying to split the bill among my lunch partners, then we realized that the prawn pasta had a surcharge of $3 that wasn't communicated to us. We went back to clarify but they left it at that. This is very sneaky and there were no apologies for it. Will not go back."

Veg choices range from brinjal to fried potato strips (like fries). It's all free flow since it's a buffet.You pay for the variety and going for a second round I guess. It's quite cheap, considering the last few times I went to an Indian food stall, I am usually charged 4+ dollars for briyani, 2 veg, one meat and curry over my briyani, and much smaller portions.Taste-wise, it's all like quite above average, nothing tastes bad. Better than some buffets, and great price. And I just like having the choice!Of course, they cater to the working-lunch crowd, so no one does eat so much :P Maybe that's why they can charge 7.90.

They say """"Better a dry crust eaten in peace than a house filled with feasting--and conflict."""" Prata Prata's dry crusted prata kept the people away, so you could have a peaceful lunch here. Other food options were expensive and not popular as well. But then they came up with the idea to have a buffet lunch. $7,90 for 4 choices of veggies, 3 choices of meats, 2 choices of rice and unlimited prata! And you also get a free glass of water! Since then it became a house fulled with feasting and conflict as well. When I say conflict I mean fighting for an empty space to sit, complaining about dirty tables and for prata, because the poor guy just can't keep up with the demand. Best is to enjoy this lunch buffet before 12:30 so you can feast in peace"

They have a myriad of YTF items, like intestines, fish maw, pork belly, all sorts of veggies et al, and they dump a liberal amount of fried ikan bilis into your soup before serving, which incidentally, is the BEST soup base I've ever tried.I don't take their noodles, but they sprinkle fried lard on top of them. You likey?Pro tip: When you queue for your YTF, get your friend to pick the items. Do not pick the items together, as you will have to wait ONE hour for your turn. Collaboration is key here!"

However these times are not set in stone - we arrived at 12:30am and the food was only ready around 1am. The advantage of this timing is that the hawker centre is really empty - only a few random drink stalls were open, and only the one beside the yong tau foo seemed to be going at full steam.And then there's the confusing system of ordering - there's no guide for first-timers and the staff are a bit grumpy and assume everyone knows what the system is; it doesn't help that some of the information online (which I'd read to prepare for my visit) is wrong.As far as I can tell, the way the ordering system works is this: there're 2 queues. The first is on the right for you to select what items you want, and the second is on the left for you to send in your order. These queues work independently - so you should come with at least one other person so both of you can queue in either queue at the same time. Once it's the turn of the person in the left (order) queue, your order will be taken and you should say if you want noodles or bee hoon (or neither), if you want vegetables, if you want your order done dry or with soup (everyone had it dry so that's presumably better), if you want pork oil and if you want chili and/or sweet sauce (presumably only for dry orders). And don't block the exit to the stall because the lady will periodically emerge with huge steaming bowls and place them on a tray on the table outside the stall.There's a huge variety of ingredients here - the largest I've ever seen at a yong tau foo stall. And you don't find many elsewhere: pork belly, intestines, luncheon meat, squid, cuttlefish, stuffed mushrooms and your usual things (like lady's finger stuffed with fish paste).Their soup is quite spicy on the default setting, so you might want to ask for no added chili (it's even spicier than the chili sauce in noodles, since the man cuts chili padi into it)The pork oil, crispy lard, sweet and chili sauces all combine to explode in your mouth in a harmonious blend.At 1:30am the first queue had died and at 2:10am there were only two people in either queue. So if you can wait a bit it's better to come a bit later. And it's not like food will run out - some things which had run out were replenished even at 2am.This place could definitely use a process improvement consultant and more signs, but if you're hungry and in the area you could do worse than drop by."

Best of all, you can get all fried wantons!! Remember to get a scoop of mayonnaise to accompany the wantons! The soup is good too, not bland or full of MSG at other places.

For $4, you get a good amount of noodles with a few crispy wan tan AND a bowl of soup WITH more wan tans. This particular Pontian is located right across from Cold Storage in Star Vista.
