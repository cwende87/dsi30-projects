 This FlowingData post by Nathan Yau shows the same data visualized 25 different ways.
 
 
 ### If-This-Then-That Rules
- If I am stating one or two numbers, then:
    - **simply report the numbers**.
    - compare numbers using a **bar chart**.
- If I am visualizing the distribution of one variable, then:
    - If that variable is qualitative: **use a bar chart**.
    - If that variable is quantitative: **use a histogram**.
- If I am visualizing the relationship between two variables, then:
    - If both variables are qualitative, then: 
        - If there are at most three categories for both variable, then **use a table**.
        - If there are more than three categories in either variable, then **use a heatmap**.
    - If both variables are quantitative, then:
        - If one variable is time, then **use a line plot**.
        - Otherwise, **use a scatterplot**.
    - If one variable is quantitative and another is qualitative then:
        - **Use a bunch of histograms**.
        - Stacked bar charts, if you choose to do so.
