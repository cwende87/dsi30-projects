It is most commonly spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito. Roughly 20% of people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms which could lead to a more serious and fatal illness. Only certain species of mosquitoes can transmit WNV as shared by ([*source*](https://www.sgvmosquito.org/west-nile-virus)). \n","\n","#### **Culex Pipiens**\n","The species - Culex Pipiens is considered the primary bridge of WNV to humans. A study done on Culex Pipiens on how is the lifespan affected by temperature. The results shows that lifespan increased when tempareture is decreased and vice versa. In terms of sex, female displayed a 1.2-1.4-fold longer longevity compared to the males. One can understand more from ([*source*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25284257/)).\n","\n","#### **Life Cycle of a Mosquito**\n","Mosquitoes have 4 life stages: egg, larve, pupa and adult. The entire life cycle (from an egg to an adult) takes approximately 8-10 days as shared by CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) ([*source*](https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/resources/factsheets/mosquitolifecyclefinal.pdf)). Under normal conditions, the average adult mosquito generally lives for approximately 2-3 weeks outdoors and lives for approximately 1 month indoors as shared by MMPC ([*source*](https://www.mandmpestcontrol.com/how-long-do-mosquitoes-live-and-what-that-means-for-you/)).\n","\n","#### **West Nile Virus Peak Season and Optimal Conditions**\n","Most cases of WNV happens during mosquito season, which starts in summer and continues through fall. This is due to the fact that mosquitoes breed in water. The 'Preventive Pest Control' blog shares some weather patterns that aid mosquitoes breeding. One can understand more from ([*source*](https://www.orkin.com/pests/mosquitoes/when-are-mosquitoes-most-active)). Some factors are:\n","\n","- Rain Water\n","  - Flooding rains are ideal for mosquitoes to lay their egg.\n","  - When a water is stagnate, which is often the case with flood waters, there is a much greater chance that mosquitoes will lay eggs.\n","\n","- Precipitation\n","  - Heavy rainfall may injure flying, exposed mosquitoes and force them to seek shelter, thus preventing flight.\n","\n","- Higher Temperature\n","  - Hot weather actually shortens the incubation time of mosquito eggs.\n","  - Research also shows that number of mosquitoes carrying disease like West Nile is increased by warmer weather.\n","\n","\n","#### **Mosquitoes Activity**\n","Mosquitoes are most active at night and are likely to start to bite early in the evening. Hence, the best time to kill adult mosquitoes is to spray at dusk, when they are most active and looking for people to bite. Mosquitoes activity are affected by:\n","\n","- Humidity \n","  - High humidity conditions favor mosquito activity.\n","  - While low humidity suppresses activity and may even cause mortality.\n","\n","- Wind\n","  - Mosquitoes generally are not strong flyers therefore, mild, little or no wind would be good for mosquito activity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2EgMSq-qhZXI"},"source":["## Problem Statement"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5MpbdjnihZZU"},"source":["West Nile Virus (WNV) is a deadly virus that should not be taken lightly.
