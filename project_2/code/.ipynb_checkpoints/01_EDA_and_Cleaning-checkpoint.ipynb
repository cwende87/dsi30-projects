    "1. The train dataset has all of the columns that you will need to generate and refine your models. The test dataset has all of those columns except for the target that you are trying to predict in your Regression model.\n",

    "    - train-test split\n",
    "    - cross-validation / grid searching for hyperparameters\n",
    "    - strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables\n",
    "    - code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (such as the preprocessing library)\n",
    "3. Predict the values for your target column in the test dataset and consider submitting your predictions to Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.\n",
    "    - **Note**: Kaggle expects to see your submissions in a specific format. Check the challenge's page to make sure you are formatting your CSVs correctly!\n",
    "    - **You are limited to models you've learned in class so far**. In other words, you cannot use XGBoost, Neural Networks or any other advanced model for this project.\n",
    "4. Evaluate your models!\n",
    "    - consider your evaluation metrics\n",
    "    - consider your baseline score\n",
    "    - how can your model be used for inference?\n",
    "    - why do you believe your model will generalize to new data?"
